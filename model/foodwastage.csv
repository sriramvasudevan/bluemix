"If the amount of food wasted around the world were reduced by just a quarter there would be enough food to feed everyone on the planet, according to the UN.  Each year 1.3bn tonnes of food, about a third of all that is produced, is wasted, including about 45% of all fruit and vegetables, 35% of fish and seafood, 30% of cereals, 20% of dairy products and 20% of meat. Meanwhile, 795 million people suffer from severe hunger and malnutrition.  In developing countries there are high levels of unintentional wastage, often due to poor equipment, transportation and infrastructure. In wealthy countries, on the other hand, there are low levels of unintentional losses but high levels of “food waste”, when food is thrown away by consumers because they have bought too much or by retailers because it doesn’t look right.  Across the globe, initiatives such as food-sharing clubs and projects aimed at reducing post-harvest losses for poor farmers are making a difference.

"If the amount of food wasted around the world were reduced by just 25% there would be enough food to feed all the people who are malnourished, according to the UN. Each year 1.3bn tonnes of food, about a third of all that is produced, is wasted, including about 45% of all fruit and vegetables, 35% of fish and seafood, 30% of cereals, 20% of dairy products and 20% of meat. Meanwhile, 795 million people suffer from severe hunger and malnutrition. Well-publicised attempts to combat the loss of food – such as recent laws in France that require supermarkets to distribute unsold food to charities – have highlighted the issue of food waste, identified by the UN as one of the great challenges to achieving food security. Estimates suggest that by 2050 food production will need to have increased by 60% on 2005 levels to feed a growing global population. Reducing food wastage would ease the burden on resources as the world attempts to meet future demand.   Related: Fighting food waste: four stories from around the world    The problem is global but manifests itself in starkly different ways. In developing countries there are high levels of what is known as “food loss”, which is unintentional wastage, often due to poor equipment, transportation and infrastructure. In wealthy countries, there are low levels of unintentional losses but high levels of “food waste”, which involves food being thrown away by consumers because they have purchased too much, or by retailers who reject food because of exacting aesthetic standards. In developed countries, consumers and retailers throw away between 30% and 40% of all food purchased, whereas in poorer countries only 5% to 16% of food is thrown away. According to a 2011 report, in Europe and North America each person wasted 95-115kg of otherwise edible food annually, whereas in sub-Saharan Africa and south and south-east Asia the equivalent waste was just 6-11kg. “In the developing world, food waste is virtually nonexistent,” says Robert van Otterdijk, coordinator of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation’s Save Food programme.  “Food waste is happening in countries where people can afford to throw away food. One statistic is that the amount of food wasted by consumers in industrialised countries [222m tonnes a year] is almost the same as the total net food production of sub-Saharan Africa [230m tonnes]. “But food losses, on the other hand, are really rampant in developing countries because of the underdeveloped conditions they have, from management of production to transportation and distribution.”   Related: Produced but never eaten:  a visual guide to food waste    The environmental impact of food loss and waste is high. The carbon footprint of food produced and not eaten is estimated at 3.3 gigatonnes of CO2, meaning that if food waste were a country it would rank as the third highest national emitter of greenhouse gases after the US and China. About 1.4bn hectares, or close to 30% of available agricultural land, is used to grow or farm food that is subsequently wasted. And more surface and groundwater, or “blue water”, is used to produce wasted food around the globe than is used for agriculture by any single country, including India and China. “The whole issue of climate change has to do with our economy of production and consumption being out of balance with what the Earth can provide,” says Van Otterdijk. “Production of food is one of the biggest production sectors in the world, and if one-third of all this is just produced in vain you can imagine what a huge impact this has on the natural resources – on land, water, energy and greenhouse gas emissions.” The worst food waste offenders are the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, where consumers waste 39% of all food purchased, followed by Europe, where about 31% of all food purchased by consumers is thrown away. In the UK, 15m tonnes of food is lost or wasted each year. British consumers throw away 4.2m tonnes of edible food each year, equivalent in weight to 86 QE2s. This means that 11.7% of all food purchased is avoidably wasted, at an estimated cost to each family of £700 a year, or almost £60 a month. The foods most commonly found in British bins are bread, vegetables, fruit and milk. According to a nationwide analysis of food waste in UK households conducted by the food charity Wrap, the most wasted food in the UK by weight is bread, with consumers throwing away 414,000 tonnes (22.4%) of all bread purchased. By percentage, the most wasted food is lettuce and leafy salads, of which consumers throw away 38% (64,000 tonnes) of all they buy.  The most wasted meat, by both percentage and weight, is poultry, of which 13% of all edible parts (not including bones) is wasted, and the most wasted fruit by percentage is melon, with the equivalent of more than a quarter of each melon thrown in the bin. The UK has made progress in the past 10 years after a concerted campaign to reduce wastage. It is singled out by Van Otterdijk as “one of the great successes” in combating food waste.     For every 2 tonnes of food and drink consumed in the home, another tonne is going to waste at some point in the chain  David Moon, head of ​food ​​sustainability at W​rap UK     Between 2007 and 2012, the amount of avoidable food waste produced by UK households decreased by 21%, from 5.3m tonnes to 4.2m tonnes, largely due to greater awareness as a result of campaigns such as Wrap’s Love Food, Hate Waste. Of the food that is not eaten, less is ending up in landfill. In 2000-01, only 14% of household waste was recycled or composted, but by 2011-12 the amount of composted food had risen to 43%. “We have had feedback from people internationally that they do look to the UK as an example,” says Dr David Moon, head of food sustainability at Wrap UK. “But considering the levels of waste we have there’s considerably more to do. For every 2 tonnes of food and drink consumed in the home, there’s another tonne of food going to waste at some point in the chain – whether that’s production, retail or manufacturing.” Van Otterdijk says there has been a “very encouraging, unexpected, continuing interest” in the subject of food waste, enabling grass-roots campaigns around the world to gain traction. “We have to do much more and it needs the participation of public and private sectors,” he says. “But if it continues like this, with the same momentum, maybe after 10 years we’ll have globally significant results.” • This article was amended on 13 August 2015 to clarify a quote from the UN.",2015-08-12T06:00:17Z,"Cutting food waste by a quarter would mean enough for everyone, says UN","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""3b305f8b9aa1f94efb474c1596f23064dbdf0c56""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/3b305f8b9aa1f94efb474c1596f23064dbdf0c56/0_0_3744_2568/1000.jpg"" alt=""Food waste "" width=""1000"" height=""686"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">In developed countries, consumers and retailers throw away between 30% and 40% of all food purchased. </span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>",3,"With the global population rising, wastage of products including 45% of all fruit and vegetables and 35% of fish and seafood is one of the greatest challenges to achieving food security",http://media.guim.co.uk/e804a4fc2b5c23c8da2d096a4d6cb730208c81f4/109_241_3278_1967/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/12/cutting-food-waste-enough-for-everyone-says-un,0,neutral
"UK A group of volunteers stand in the FareShare depot in Deptford, south-east London, as shift coordinator James Souteriou calls out items. They are putting together grocery orders to be delivered to organisations across London – to a branch of the homelessness charity Thames Reach, to the Holborn Community Association and a local nursery and infants’ school. “Can I get a tray of pineapples? A tray of chicken madras? Three boxes of porridge?” James calls and the volunteers scurry off in their hi-vis vests and steel-capped boots to fetch the items from towering piles of food.   Related: Cutting food waste by a quarter would mean enough for everyone, says UN    The quantity of food in the depot is overwhelming. In the centre of one of the aisles is a delivery from a supermarket of about 500 jars of pasta sauce. Boxes of rice are stacked on shelves to the roof and the walk-in dairy fridge is so full that somewhere else has to be found to store excess yoghurt. The volunteers collect trays of pork sausages, potatoes, stir fry sauces, bread, watermelon, eggs, chicken, apples, cereal and fruit juice. All of the food looks appetising and is within its best-before date. But if it weren’t for FareShare, all of it would have been thrown away. FareShare has been running as an independent charity since 2004. It collects food from supermarkets, cafe chains, bakeries and other retailers that would otherwise be discarded and distributes it to 2,020 charities across the country. Last year it redistributed 7,360 tonnes of food, providing 15.3m meals and saving the British voluntary sector an estimated £19m. One of the charities that receives weekly deliveries from FareShare is the Deptford Methodist Mission Disabled People’s Contact (DPC), which provides three-course lunches for elderly people in the area three days a week. Since the DPC began receiving FareShare deliveries in February 2014 it has cut its food bill by 30%, meaning it can direct funds elsewhere, such as a much-needed new minibus for which the centre is currently fundraising. “It’s the best thing that’s ever happened to us. We get such good stuff, things we’d never be able to afford,” says Lisa Helsby, the volunteer coordinator at the DPC.   Related: Produced but never eaten:  a visual guide to food waste    “One day we got salmon and mangoes,” says Erica Ross, day centre manager, “and it just happened to be the day the mayor was visiting, so we thought, oh aren’t we fancy? But then we also wanted to let the mayor know, we don’t always eat like this! It’s not all salmon!” Salmon or not, the people who attend the centre are not complaining about the food. DPC regular Pat’s favourite is the pork pot roast with the trimmings. “The roast is unbelievable. It’s very good,” she says. For Pat, 73, the appeal of the DPC is the social connection. “You get lonely and sometimes when it’s just you at home you don’t make a proper meal.” She has been coming for seven years, for lunches on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and is devastated when she has to miss it. “It shuts down for two weeks at Christmas and two weeks over summer, and we all can’t wait to get back.” FareShare has begun to change attitudes to food waste in the UK retail sector, but Mark Varney, head of FareShare’s food department, says there is a long way to go. “Last year we collected 7,300 tonnes, but our French sister organisation redistributes 100,000 tonnes a year. In Portugal it’s even higher than that per head of the population. It’s high in Germany, Belgium, Holland, Italy. So the UK is by far the smallest,” he says. Organisations in other European countries are helped by funding from the EU to buy warehouses and trucks, as well as national tax systems that allow supermarkets to claim rebates on produce given to FareShare-type organisations, whereas the UK has neither of these incentives.    Related: Are you involved in preventing food wastage? Share your projects    FareShare also finds itself competing against alternative and much cheaper methods for supermarkets to deal with excess food: selling it to be used for anaerobic digestion, which turns food into electricity, and animal feed, both of which Varney says are “great for food that actually is waste” – such as banana skins or apple cores – but not the ideal solution for food that is still edible. “The management time involved and costs of logistics in keeping food as food are higher than they would be if I were treating it as waste. We’re constantly fighting against that,” he says. Varney remains optimistic and ambitious. “Our goal is to increase the amount of food collected to 100,000 tonnes by the end of this parliament,” he says. Kate Lyons China     Zhang Qinyu uses the internet to help farmers sell their produce.    Zhang Qinyu was born and raised in Shaanxi province, China’s biggest fruit-producing region. His hometown, Xianyang, is the country’s apple capital. Growing up in Shaanxi, Zhang, 23, witnessed not just an abundance of fruit and vegetables but also the scandalous waste of produce that was allowed to rot before it could be sold because of poor storage facilities.  Food waste is a severe problem in China. Last year Xinhua, China’s official news agency, reported that $32bn worth of food – enough to feed 200 million people – was lost each year.  Vegetable and fruit wastage in China, Japan and South Korea has been identified by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) as a key area to be tackled. It estimates that almost 40% of all fruit and vegetables produced in these countries are wasted. Between them, China, Japan and South Korea produce more than 50% of the world’s vegetables and so this wastage equals a very large quantity of food. After graduating last year Zhang looked to the internet for a fix, and set up Shaanxi Yihong Agricultural Technology Company, an online firm that helps connect rural farmers with hungry consumers in urban China.  “I realised e-commerce could provide a solution to their problem. E-commerce links the farmers to customers, bypassing wholesale buyers, making it easier for farmers to sell their fruit and vegetables so less goes to waste,” he says. Through Weibo, China’s answer to Twitter, Zhang has helped farmers shift produce including spring onions, pears, apples, dates and kiwis. Part of the country’s problem is that many farmers lack the technology to adequately store their produce, he says. “Many are using cellars rather than proper cold storage units.” Another major issue is that small-scale farmers – hoping for the highest possible price – often wait too long before offloading their crops.  Earlier this year Zhang used the internet to help farmers in Qian county, Shaanxi, find buyers for 3,000 tonnes of pears that would otherwise have spoiled. “When the farmers harvested the pears last October, they didn’t know the latest market price and thought the price offered to them was too low,” says Zhang. Rather than selling, they put the pears into cellars, hoping that the price would rise during the Chinese new year, but in fact nearly lost everything. He placed an advert on Weibo reading: “I have checked the pears myself and they are big, juicy and sweet.” It worked. The fruit found buyers before it rotted.  “If we had not stepped in, those pears would have gone bad and the farmers’ hard work would have been wasted,” says Zhang.  Tom Phillips in Beijing; additional reporting by Luna Lin Uganda     Hasifa Nakaziba, who grows maize and beans. Photograph: Amy Fallon    Hasifa Nakaziba, a mother of seven, has relied on farming maize and beans to support her family for years. But each year she would lose 30% of her harvest as pests infested her grain, taking their share of the food before it reached the dinner table “From nowhere rats, chickens and insects would come and eat it,” said Nakaziba, who lives in Nambale village, about 85 miles east of the capital, Kampala. Like many farmers, Nakaziba, 47, lacked proper drying facilities for the grain and so would dry it on the ground before storage, unaware that this could lead to deadly aflatoxin contamination. Her inability to safely store her harvest also forced her to sell her grain early, which meant Nakaziba received a very low price from the local market. “It affected our income, food security and also the education of our children,” she says. Then in 2014 Nakaziba’s life changed. She received training in post-harvest handling from the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP), which launched an operation designed to reduce post-harvest food losses for 16,600 low-income farmers in Uganda by providing them with simple storage facilities, such as silos, granaries and grain storage bags. In a workshop Nakaziba learned how to improve her farm management practices and purchase new technology storage and handling equipment. Today a huge airtight silo, allowing Nakaziba to safely store more than 500kg of grain for as long as she desires, for family consumption or sale, sits in a corner of her modest home. “If the market price is favourable, the farmer can choose to sell, but they are now no longer forced to sell immediately following harvest to avoid losses,” explains WFP’s Uganda programme officer, Richard Sewava. Nakaziba, who purchased the silo and a plastic tarpaulin from the WFP on a cost-sharing basis, is happy. “Now the rats cannot get to my grain, and by selling later I am able to get 900 shillings [16p] per kilogram instead of 350,” she says. “With the extra money I’m getting I can buy things for my children and my garden.” The programme has been hugely successful in Uganda, where about 95% of food losses occur in the post-harvest, production, and distribution stages and only 5% is wasted by consumers. Ninety-eight per cent of farmers who participated in the programme said it helped them reduce crop losses to below 2% of their harvest, and the majority of participants doubled their average selling price in each major crop. The ability to lock the storage silos proved particularly helpful for female farmers, who are more vulnerable to their crops being stolen, with more than 98% reporting a significant increase in household food security. The project is being expanded this year to reach more than 42,000 low-income farming families in Uganda. “Given the wonderful success we are witnessing in Uganda, there is a high level of interest now being shown by neighbouring countries Rwanda, South Sudan, Kenya and Tanzania for similar implementation support,”says the WFP project leader Simon Costa. Amy Fallon in Kampala Germany     Raphael Fellmer, the founder of Food Rescue. Photograph: Stephan Benz    Margarete Herrmann has popped out of her psychotherapy practice in the leafy Berlin suburb of Zehlendorf and cycled to the nearby organic store, Bio Company, for a twice-weekly pickup appointment. A salesperson greets her at the shop and hands over five boxes full of food. Carrots, cream, yoghurts, beansprouts, tofu burgers and bread rolls are among the items inside.  Herrmann is one of about 8,000 “food-savers” across Germany, Switzerland and Austria who combat food waste through the growing online platform Foodsharing.  Herrmann carefully sorts through the food, deciding what she will keep and what she’ll give to others in her neighbourhood, or sometimes just strangers on the street.  She is joined by Raphael Fellmer, the founder of Food Rescue, which merged with Foodsharing at the end of 2014. His food-saving life began as a “dumpster diver”, sorting through the bins of food stores and picking out good food that had been thrown away. “But I wanted to find a more socially acceptable way of saving food, rather than risk being caught by the police with my head in a bin,” he says.  In the three years since Foodsharing began, Herrmann, Fellmer and the growing army of food-savers have carried out 150,000 pickups from 1,600 shops and saved almost 2,000 tonnes of food from supermarkets, restaurants and bakeries that otherwise would have been thrown away.  Fellmer, 31, proudly points to the bins at the back of the store to show how much the waste has been reduced since Foodsharing began. “When we started they had three times as many bins,” he says. The food savers take the food to communal shelves and fridges – of which there are now about 300 – known as Fair Teiler (a play on verteiler, the German word for distributor) . The highest concentration is in Berlin, which boasts 19 of them.  Sarah, a student, takes a detour to one in the hip eastern district of Prenzlauer Berg, on her way home from university. Accompanied by her golden retriever puppy she heads into the graffitied inner courtyard of a 19th-century house on Dunckerstrasse, and peruses the shelves of a gaudy orange fridge . “What have we got today then?” she asks, before retrieiving two bread rolls, some carrots, a wilting parsnip and some rocket salad. “That should do me for my supper,” the 25-year-old says. “And two things that really cheer me: I’ve rescued the food, and it’s free.” As she leaves, Nora, a physiotherapist, cycles into the courtyard to fill the shelves with low-fat milk and ripe bananas she has just picked up from a local shop. “The best thing about this is how it raises the awareness about waste,” she says.   That the system functions has much to do with the goodwill of volunteers such as Gérard Roscoe Misler, who ensures the fridge is clean and the food inside is still fresh enough to eat. The 53-year-old countertenor and urban gardener, who also runs a community shop at the front of the house, painted the fridge orange, and ensures it stands on a wooden table to stop rats getting inside.  He says the distribution point has become increasingly important the more gentrified Prenzlauer Berg has become. “There are lots of people here who don’t have much money and who find it a lifesaver to be able to get some milk or bread,” he says. Buoyed by its tremendous popularity and by the many requests received to set up similar online platforms across the globe, Foodsharing’s creators are due to send the website’s template out into the world by the end of the year, when it will go fully open source  in the hope of sparking an anti-waste initiative on a global scale.

"The large white fridge sits prominently on a pavement in Galdakao, a small city on the outskirts of Bilbao. A wooden fence has been built around it, in the hope of conveying the idea that this is not an abandoned appliance, but a pioneering project aimed at tackling food wastage. For the past seven weeks, Galdakao, population 29,000, has been home to Spain’s first “solidarity fridge”, in which residents and restaurants can drop off leftover or unused food otherwise destined for the bin. Anything left in the fridge can be picked up by anyone who wants it. “I would guess we’ve saved between 200 and 300kg from the rubbish bin,” said organiser Álvaro Saiz. A typical day might see leftover lentils, a few sandwiches and unopened milk cartons left in the fridge.   Related: France to force big supermarkets to give unsold food to charities    The idea came about as Saiz and other members of the city’s volunteer association were reflecting on the sheer amount of food being thrown out by supermarkets. “We started to think that if even just one of their rubbish bins was replaced with a fridge, people could take advantage of these items.” After an online search revealed a network of shared fridges in Berlin, he said. “We realised we could do this – so we did.” It took about a month to wade through the paperwork needed for the project, including securing a permit from the city to use public space and obtaining the right legal documents to ensure organisers wouldn’t be held liable should anything go wrong with food taken from the fridge.     Galdakao’s ‘solidarity fridge’. Photograph: Ashifa Kassam    As his group pushed forward with the idea, they heard all sorts of opinions from city residents, said the 36-year-old. “I realised that the people who don’t support it, it’s because they don’t understand what we’re doing.” The goal, according to Saiz, isn’t to feed people in need. “This isn’t charity. It’s about making use of food that would otherwise end up in the bin,” he said. “It doesn’t matter who takes it – Julio Iglesias could stop by and take the food – at the end of the day it’s about recovering the value of food products and fighting against waste.” There are strict rules for anyone leaving food in the fridge: no raw fish, meat or eggs, packaged or canned goods cannot be past their use-by date and anything prepared at home must include a label detailing when it was made.   Related: World leaders urged to tackle food waste to save billions and cut emissions    Volunteers keep an eye on the fridge to throw out anything past its use-by date or homemade dishes that are more than four days old. But that’s in theory: so far all food has been taken on a daily basis.  All sorts of people have dropped by so far, said Saiz, including those in need who make a special trip to the fridge from nearby towns and a construction worker who took an ice-cream bar – dropped off with just a few days left before its best-before date – during his lunch break.  Last week the city of Murcia, some 400 miles away in the the south of Spain, copied the idea and became the second Spanish city to host a solidarity fridge. Saiz has received calls from communities across the country – and from as far as Bolivia – from people interested in setting up similar operations. The fridge has also allowed local restaurants to alleviate guilt over their food wastage, said Álvaro Llonin of Topa restaurant. “Before we used to throw away a lot of food – and it was food that was fine to eat.” He and the staff at the busy restaurant in the centre of Galdakaonow regularly make time to drop off their leftovers in the fridge. “You know someone is enjoying it,” he said. “It’s like giving our food a second chance to end up in someone’s stomach.”",2015-06-25T14:17:36Z,The solidarity fridge: Spanish town's cool way to cut food waste,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""9143cdd58d245b766e25cf8c49aea63a20af627c""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434065427892/e3999776-4d5a-4483-a2b9-980ac2e6f533-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""food for spanish fridge story"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">There are strict rules for anyone leaving food in the fridge: no raw fish, meat or eggs, packaged or canned goods cannot be past their use-by date and anything prepared at home must include a label about when it was made.</span> </figcaption> </figure>",5,Everyone from vulnerable families to peckish builders are taking leftover goods left dropped off by local people in Galdakao ,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434065428239/e3999776-4d5a-4483-a2b9-980ac2e6f533-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/25/solidarity-fridge-spanish-town-cut-food-waste-galdakao,1,negative
"One-quarter of all the food in the world is lost each year, owing to inefficient harvesting, inadequate storage, and wastage in the kitchen. Halve that waste, and the world could feed an extra billion people – and make hunger yesterday’s problem. The extent of food loss is particularly galling in view of a new global study on food security from the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation. According to the FAO, 57 developing countries have failed to achieve the millennium development goal of halving the proportion of hungry people by this year. One in every nine people on the planet – 795 million in all – still goes to sleep hungry.   Related: Agriculture will drive Africa's rise to economic power    Of course, there has also been remarkable progress: over the last 25 years, the world has fed an extra two billion people, and – for all the 57 failures – the developing world as a whole has almost halved its hunger rate. But the challenge is to sustain the progress: by 2050, demand for food will have nearly doubled. One reason is that by then the world will have added another two billion mouths to feed; a second reason will be the growing appetite of a surging new middle class. At the moment, the UN is considering 169 new development targets to succeed the millennium development goals (hunger is one target area, among many). These targets are vitally important, because they will determine how more than $2.5tn in development money is spent on everything from climate change to malaria. My thinktank, the Copenhagen Consensus Center, therefore asked 60 teams of top economists to assess which proposed targets will do the most good – and which will not. Our research on food security shows that there are smart ways to feed many more on the planet – but they have little to do with the campaigns against waste seen in most of the rich world. In the rich world, the focus is on food wasted by the consumer. This makes sense: more than half of the rich world’s losses take place in its kitchens (basically because we can afford it). In Britain, for example, the greatest waste is in salads, vegetables, and fruits – luxuries when compared with the cheap calories contained in the grains and tubers consumed throughout the developing world. Smaller households in rich countries waste more per person, because it is harder to put everything to use, while richer households add waste when they can afford to buy extra “just to be on the safe side”.   Related: Permaculture in Malawi: using food forests to prevent floods and hunger    By contrast, the world’s hungry poor waste very little, simply because they cannot afford to. In Africa, daily food waste averages 500 calories per person – but consumers account for only 5% of this loss. More than three-quarters of the waste occurs well before the kitchen, in inefficient agriculture, because birds and rats eat crops during harvest, for example, or pests spoil grain stores. There are many remedies for this kind of waste – from the “curing” of roots and tubers to minimize damage, to more expensive refrigeration. So why aren’t these technologies – widely used in richer countries – adopted in the developing world? The answer is a lack of infrastructure. If there are no proper roads linking fields to markets, farmers cannot easily sell their surplus produce, which may then spoil before it can be eaten. Improving road and rail capacity enables farmers to reach buyers – and fertilizer and other agricultural inputs to reach farmers. Supplying reliable electricity permits grains to be dried and vegetables to be kept cool. Economists from the International Food Policy Research Institute estimate that the overall cost of approximately halving post-harvest losses in the developing world would be $239 billion over the next 15 years – and would generate benefits worth more than $3 trillion, or $13 of social benefits for every dollar spent.   Related: From dust bowl to bread basket: digging the dirt on soil erosion    This would make food more affordable for the poor. By 2050, better infrastructure could mean that 57 million people – more than the current population of South Africa – would no longer be at risk of hunger, and that about four million children would no longer suffer from malnutrition. Most of these gains would be in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, the world’s most deprived regions. But there is an even better investment. We can achieve three times the economic benefits, and even larger reductions in the number of people at risk of hunger, if we focus on improving food production rather than just on preventing food losses. Today, only $5bn is spent annually on research to improve the seven major global food crops, and just one-tenth of that is targeted to help small farmers in Africa and Asia. Investing an extra $88bn in agricultural research and development over the next 15 years would increase yields by an additional 0.4% each year. That might not sound like very much, but the reduction in prices and improvements in food security would help almost everyone. It would be worth nearly $3tn in social good – yielding an enormous $34 of benefits for every dollar spent. Hunger is a complex problem, exacerbated by financial pressures, volatile commodity prices, natural disasters, and civil wars. But we could take an enormous step toward winning the global campaign against malnutrition, simply by investing in improved infrastructure and in agricultural research and development. © Project Syndicate 2014 Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians.

"It might not make a James Bond plot, but an “epic mission” has been launched to save 250 tonnes of parsnips at a farm in Norfolk this Saturday. This is “gleaning”, the practice of salvaging fresh fruit and vegetables that have been leftover or that are not economically viable to harvest, by collecting it from farms by hand. The mission has been organised by Feedback, which coordinates volunteers, farmers and food distribution charities, and runs the Gleaning Network campaign. It is their biggest operation so far: 250 tonnes of parsnips translates into 300m portions of food, and although Feedback aren’t aiming to save all the parsnips, what they do save they will redistribute to food charities. The prices offered for the parsnips by supermarkets were so low that the farmer who grew them couldn’t harvest them without losing money. “Making a connection with all the food and seeing the amount that goes to waste is startling,” says Martin Bowman, Feedback’s national gleaning coordinator. On the day of the gleaning mission there will be a group of volunteers travelling from all over the country to help harvest the vegetables. “We are also taking people from the local area up to the farm,” says Bowman. “The farmer is going to lift the parsnips out of the ground for us. We’re going to put them into containers ready to be redistributed.” An estimated 89m tonnes of food is wasted in the EU every year, but while the UK tops the charts for wastage, France has recently announced a new law banning supermarkets from destroying unsold food. Supermarkets will now be expected to separate the food for charities or animal feed. Although an inquiry by the House of Lords last year found that supermarkets contributed just 1.3% of food waste in the UK, we waste over 12m tonnes of food, three million more than the second worst performer, Germany. The fact that the UK is a country where people can’t always afford to eat yet also has a huge problem with food wastage causes immense frustration among gleaners. Since the coalition took power in 2010, there has been a 400% increase in Trussell Trust food banks (the UK’s main provider) and there are now more than 1,000 operating around the country. “Fifty-eight million people are suffering from food insecurity worldwide, let alone in the UK,” says Bowman. “Gleaning is really important, but at the end of the day it is a short-term solution. The solution would be designing food waste out of the system in the first place, which would mean nobody would have to go hungry.”",2015-06-02T17:24:00Z,Meet the gleaners helping themselves to one Norfolk farmer's crop of parsnips,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""7d059e2dce4450c0a5685fc972f4fdcd3175aaf6""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433262943746/14383351-ad26-45e3-8785-719c0751b88f-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Parsnip gleaning in Norfolk."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Parsnip gleaning in Norfolk.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: feedbackglobal.org</span> </figcaption> </figure>",7,"When the value of crops is so low that they’re not worth harvesting, waste-busting volunteers makes sure they aren’t left to rot",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433262944107/14383351-ad26-45e3-8785-719c0751b88f-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/global/shortcuts/2015/jun/02/gleaners-food-waste-parsnips,0,negative
"If you’ve ever been in hospital, there’s a good chance that the one thing you look forward to – apart from visiting times – will be breakfast, lunch and dinner. As Cathy Griffiths, senior development technologist at apetito, says: “If you’re poorly or recovering, mealtimes can be a perk in the day.” With so much anticipation around mealtimes, it’s essential that hospital food lives up to patient expectations, and the quality of what’s served is vital. Good nutrition is an important component of health and wellbeing and even more crucial in a hospital environment. Creating hospital menus is a complex task as there are so many factors to take into consideration. Andy Jones, former chairman of the Hospital Caterers Association, explains: “One size does not fit all, because you’ve got different cultures, different age groups, different types of patient.” As well as meeting the range of ethnic and cultural needs of the diverse population hospitals have to treat, other issues must be taken into account, such as conditions and treatment regimes that may suppress appetite or hinder swallowing, all leading to the greater risk of malnutrition. While taking all these issues into account, hospital meals must also be tasty, nutritious and enjoyable so they can enhance patient recovery.    Taste and presentation are very important – food that looks inviting, appetising and tastes good.  Julia Pockett,  speech and language therapist     To ensure hospitals are meeting the needs of their patients and offering food that will influence health and recovery, menu creation has to be a collaborative process. A team of specialists, including caterers, dietitians, speech and language therapists, nurses and even the food supplier, such as apetito,  will be involved at various stages. For example, a stroke patient may also suffer with dysphagia, which means they have difficulty swallowing – there is greater risk of choking or even aspiration pneumonia with this condition, meaning an appropriate meal with the right texture is vital. Being able to develop and provide specialist meals to meet the needs of these patients and that adhere to national guidelines is a priority for apetito and working with speech and language therapists is essential.  Julia Pockett, a speech and language therapist, explains: “A patient with dysphagia may be recommended to have a puree diet or mashable or soft food depending on how their swallow is after assessment. Taste and presentation are very important – food that looks inviting, appetising and tastes good.” An understanding of patient needs is central to the process. The apetito product development team are constantly working with their own dedicated dietitian and registered nutritionist, who in turn are constantly communicating with hospital caterers and healthcare professionals, to understand those needs – this allows them to develop meals that benefit and appeal to a wide range of patients with varying needs, whether that be an elderly patient who may be malnourished and requiring an energy dense meal or a younger post-operative patient needing high protein options.  They then use a sophisticated computer software system that can display the nutritional content of ingredients, allowing the apetito chefs to prepare each recipe to precise nutritional standards – in line with British Dietetic Association (BDA) guidelines. This attention to detail is important because, as Amanda Squire, a lecturer, dietitian, and spokeswoman for the BDA points out, the kind of healthy diet devised for the population at large may well be inappropriate for a hospital patient: “While many of us are looking at lowering calories or a balanced five fruit and vegetables a day, that isn’t always the case for patients. Somebody who’s been through surgery or major trauma is going to have extremely high protein requirements to aid their healing and their recuperation.” Caterers and food manufacturers not only have to think about dietary and nutritional requirements but also consider the food preferences of different groups of people. “The big challenge is inter-generational,” says Squire. A patient in her 80s will likely have very different tastes from a child of six. Some ethnic minority groups may require a halal, kosher or vegetarian diet. Then there is the challenge of allergies and food intolerances. “Allergies are growing,” says Jones. “Young people have got more allergies than people towards the end of their life now.” Once a meal has been researched, then created in the development kitchens, it will then go through rigorous trials and testing with customers. Sessions are arranged with hospital trusts where staff, visitors and contract decision makers can taste the food and offer feedback. There is also a monthly quality review of products, says Griffiths: “We’re trying all the time to make sure that we’re meeting all of our quality criteria and exceeding them, and [if] that isn’t the case, looking at how we can improve things.” In the last six months, the firm has reviewed every product in each category to make sure it meets quality standards. The final stage of the process is manufacturing and delivery. But before they can be delivered, a batch of every meal is put through rigorous testing in apetito’s state of the art microbiological laboratory – which is independently approved by the Campden Laboratory Accreditation Service. It is only once these tests have been completed and the satisfactory results achieved, can the meals be positively released, ensuring only “safe food” is delivered into the NHS. These high standards of testing can only be achieved with the frozen food system apetito operates. Griffiths says: “The frozen delivery system means that everything is harnessed at its freshest … we lock in that freshness. The finished product is then frozen and delivered into the hospital trust in its frozen state, so from a hospital perspective there’s very little wastage.” It’s a process that makes sure that the most important person – the patient – is always at the centre.

"Last August, a group of six young Indians took to the streets of Delhi with one simple aim: to feed the homeless. Overnight, they drove to restaurants, collected unsold food, re-packaged it and gave it to around 100 people sleeping rough in the capital.  For 27-year-old Neel Ghose, it was a wake-up call. Friends, colleagues and strangers soon joined them on drives and their numbers began to swell. In less than a few months, a nationwide volunteer movement known as the Robin Hood Army (RHA) had emerged, on a mission to curb food waste and stamp out hunger. Founders Ghose and Anand Sinha, also 27, were inspired by Refood International, an organisation based in Portugal. “Using a hyperlocal model, they collect excess food and give it to those who need it. But every community has their own Refood chapter,” explains Ghose. “I realised it was something that can be very easily done in India, where the need would be much more.” The movement gained huge momentum after the launch of its social media campaign, and now boasts a 500-strong volunteer base spread out across 13 cities, including Hyderabad, Mumbai and Kolkata. In April, the group also began operations in neighbouring Pakistan, where volunteer groups sprang up in Karachi and Lahore.     Volunteers get ready to distribute food packages throughout the city.  Photograph: Robin Hood Army    “Our Facebook page has helped us get in touch with restaurants and our posts became a form of accountability,” says Sarah Afridi, a volunteer who helped set up the group in Pakistan. Ghose agrees: “We realised that we would be much more legitimate if we showed restaurants pictures of what we were doing. That’s when things took a huge leap forward.” The Robin Hood Army’s ideology revolves around decentralisation. Small teams, mostly young professionals, become responsible for specific areas; they scout for local restaurants, convince them to donate surplus food, identify clusters of people in need – such as the homeless and orphanages – and carry out weekly distributions.  “Anand and I don’t have to be in cities physically to set up our presence,” says Ghose. “We simply guide people on how to form communities for the RHA.” Sinha adds: “What’s happening at a grassroots level is completely driven by the locals.” In Delhi and the National Capital Region alone, some 30 restaurants have been involved with the project, sometimes not only offering leftover food but cooking fresh meals for distribution. Lawyer Suvarna Mandal, 26, and head of RHA’s social media Aarushi Batra, 24, both volunteer in the city and have distributed everything from biryani and dhal to sweet treats like cakes, brownies and biscuits. While they may not always have the healthiest foods to hand out, Mandal says: “We don’t look into the nutritional aspects per se, we just try to fill their stomachs.”    In Hyderabad, four of our volunteers fed around 970 people just with excess food from one wedding.    “Some restaurant owners even join them on drives,” Ghose explains later. “In a way, they’re not just helping the Robin Hood Army, they are the Robin Hood Army.” During the Indian wedding season, which takes place between November and January, RHA groups also worked with caterers to make sure large amounts of uneaten food would be picked up, no matter how late at night. “It’s no secret that weddings in India are huge,” Batra tells me. “In Hyderabad, four of our volunteers fed around 970 people just with excess food from one wedding.” According to the Centre for Development Communication (CDC), an NGO in Jaipur, there are an estimated 7m weddings in India during the season. Yet nearly one-fifth of all prepared food is thrown away – a staggering £1.6bn in wastage. Like the RHA, the CDC developed the Annakshetra initiative, which redistributes food leftover solely from weddings, festivals and other lavish social gatherings. It was set up in 2010 after founder Dr Vivek Agrawal saw children salvaging food from piles of discarded food dumped outside a town marriage hall: “The way food is eaten and wasted in weddings is an eye-opener for everybody,” he says.      An advert on Robin Hood Army’s Facebook page encourages more volunteers to join the movement.  Photograph: Robin Hood Army    Ravi Dhingra, who helps run the foundation, says networks of volunteers collect excess food directly from events, store it in fridges overnight and check it is fit for consumption before organising handouts in the morning. In 2012, up to 10,000 were fed solely on leftovers from 16 weddings held on Akshaya Tritiya, a day considered auspicious for Hindus to tie the knot. When asked about the RHA’s work, Dhingra tells me: “Pioneering efforts like [theirs] demonstrate enormous opportunities to reduce food waste — and enhance food security worldwide.”  Yet Dhingra and Ghose also believe that while their initiatives are making a difference, there has to be more sustainable ways to tackle widespread food poverty in south Asia. “Food donations are not the solution to food wastage or poverty, [but] food redistribution can help alleviate [its] impacts,” Dhingra says.    Related: How to grow food in a slum: lessons from the sack farmers of Kibera    According to the most recent Global Hunger Index, while India no longer ranks second-to-last for having the world’s most underweight children, its overall hunger status is still classified as “serious”. Meanwhile, it remains home to a quarter of the world’s undernourished people yet it wastes more than £4bn worth of fruit and vegetables a year. Ghose is well aware of the scale of the problem: “Right now, we feed around 5,000 people a week ... In the bigger scheme of things, that’s still nothing.” But with plans to expand into more areas and partnerships with university students in the pipeline, the RHA’s influence is poised to grow across the continent. “We’re in an exciting time where more people want to bridge gaps in society,” Sinha says. “Through social media and through our volunteers, we can channel this energy and create something stronger out of this. The Robin Hood Army is just the beginning.” Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians.

"Corin Bell doesn’t care for money. She paid for her latest haircut with £15-worth of food and her website bill was settled in cake. “United Utilities aren’t having any of it,” she jokes as we finish up our cover shoot in Manchester’s Northern Quarter, “but it’s amazing how many people are up for bartering, or paying for things in different ways. Food is such a basic need. Most of the money we give to other people is used to pay for basics and there’s so much food wasted, why not just use that instead?”   Related: In the cafe where you can pay what you want, what would you choose?    If you hadn’t already guessed, Corin takes sustainability seriously. As well as heading Manchester’s Real Junk Food Project (RJFP), she’s a trustee at the Real Junk Food Charitable Foundation, which launched towards the end of last year and supports sustainable and food waste projects across the UK. There are already more than 100 Real Junk Food projects around the country. To join the network, a project must have a food waste element and also a pay-as-you-feel option. Some only use a small amount of waste and serve it as a pay-as you-feel-special. But the practice is catching on. One bar in Manchester wants Corin to find waste fruit so they can make smoothies and return the profits to the RJFP. But the foundation is not only about helping local projects. “Part of it is to offer support for people trying to set up food projects, but the other side is a campaigning arm to reduce food waste and food poverty,” says Corin. “We source food waste from everywhere and we’re now taking on the big boys. We’re talking to the Co-Op, Waitrose and Ocado,” says Corin. Part of the problem is getting people to understand exactly what the foundation is trying to do. “It’s about talking to food businesses in their own language. I’ve been called a mentalist and a thief but that’s because a lot of people don’t understand what we’re about,” she says.  “When we talk about food waste, some businesses think we’re talking about scraps and peelings. Some use the word surplus. A lot of people who work in large organisations are confused about the law around food and what’s simply company policy – it’s not illegal to give away food that is past its best-before date.” On top of this, businesses hate running out of food. “Part of catering is overcatering. If a restaurant runs out of food, there’s a feeling that it’s failed,” says Corin. “No one thinks about the food that’s left over. Street vendors can be very weather dependent, which can lead to a lot of wastage and producer markets waste food on a stupid scale.”    I’ve been called a mentalist and a thief but that’s because a lot of people don’t understand what we’re about.       The first Real Junk Food cafe was set up in Leeds by chef Adam Smith, who was astounded by the amount of farm waste on a trip to Australia. Back in the UK, he launched a pop-up cafe collecting surplus food from restaurants, supermarkets and hotels and turning it into nutritious dishes for people in need – who could either eat for free or pay what they could afford (pay as you feel). His cafe in Armley started opening regularly from December 2013. At the time Corin, who is now 34, was working for the Gleaning Network in Manchester, salvaging food destined to go to waste from farms and distributing it to local charities. She went to visit Adam and, although she’d seen lots of sustainability projects, there was something about the mix of elements in Adam’s set-up that felt right for her. “I emailed Adam and said I’d like to do something in similar in Manchester,” she says. “I wanted to know whether he was happy for me to use the Real Junk Food Project name. I still have his reply – it just said YES and NOW with lots of exclamation marks.” The movement has grown organically. “People want a business model but Adam has resisted pressure and just let it happen naturally,” says Corin. “People get in touch with him saying they want to do something similar and he gives them advice.” Corin feels the tide is turning. People are less scared of being sued. “Our biggest success story is Nando’s. There’s a great guy there called Bob who is helping some of our local projects.”  There’s no doubt the Real Junk Food network is growing. There’s one project in London, seven in Leeds, two in Bristol, one in Leicester and new projects launching in Edinburgh and north Wales. There are even a few abroad (one in the south of France, one in Cape Town and one in Victoria, Australia). “It’s less about the locations and more about the people,” says Corin. “We’re all lunatics. Adam has like three days off a year, myself, Sam (Joseph) who runs Skipchen in Bristol and Duncan (Milwain) who runs the Saltaire Canteen in Bradford - we’re all mad and working all hours.” As such, Corin seems to live off caffeine, shooting from coffee shop to warehouse to kitchen table for meetings with fellow campaigners. “l’m not interested in money,” she says. “I earn very little but I’d rather spend time doing something I’m really interested in - and that’s fun.” Corin will be discussing the Real Junk Food Project at a Guardian Live event on Wednesday 15 July at Ziferblat in Manchester.

"Britons throw away more than 4m tonnes of consumable food and drink from their homes ever year and a revamp of the sell-by-date label could save perfectly edible food from the bin bag. It was while researching how blind people utilise public transport that an industrial designer came across an innovation to keep our fridges stocked a little bit longer. Solveiga Pakstaite, 22, says the study led to her question how blind people can check sell-by dates. “One day I thought ‘how on Earth do blind people know when their food expires because they can’t read the expiry dates and they don’t know what to eat in the fridge first?’” she says. The result of her curiosity is a work in progress called the Bump Mark; a label which is attached to food packaging and changes shape when the produce deteriorates. When the food is fresh to eat, the label is smooth and curved, but when it has decayed, a plastic bump emerges when fingers are run over it. Stretching beyond the needs of blind people from where the idea originated, the new labelling is being offered as an alternative to traditional best before and expiry dates. Pakstaite, an industrial design and technology graduate from Brunel University, claims it will give a more accurate indication of freshness and save on wastage from consumers throwing out produce which may be good to eat despite being past the date on the packaging. According to the UK government, £12bn worth of food and drink is binned each year, most of it edible. And it is a worldwide problem. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN estimates that one-third of all food which is produced for human consumption is wasted, with fruit and vegetables going in the bin more than any other produce. In Europe, around 100m tonnes of food are thrown away each year. Pakstaite says: “Only one third of visually impaired people are in paid employment so the rest of them have to survive on very small benefits and they can’t really afford to be throwing food away willy-nilly. They also don’t want to get ill so they definitely [have] caution but they realise how much money they are wasting, not just food waste.” She says: “I knew straight away that it couldn’t just be a solution that could just help blind people because no retailer would take on and spend money on helping this very small group, unfortunately. That is when I went back to my original question, ‘How do blind people know when their food expires’ and then I thought ‘How does anyone know?’ We have trusted these random dates that are put on and no one actually knows when their food expires and that is why we are throwing away so much food.” She developed her device by using gelatine, a foodstuff made from the bones of animals and typically used as a setting agent for desserts. When it sets, it becomes a solid jelly but then turns to liquid when it expires.     Solveig Pakstaite’s Bump Mark. Photo by Linda Nylind. Photograph: Linda Nylind/Guardian    Prototypes for Pakstaite’s invention appear on the corner of food packets as a modest triangle. It consists of a layered pod: on the bottom is a sheet of plastic with bumps on it, which is then topped with a gelatine solution and sealed. Gelatine, being an organic material, deteriorates at the same rate as the food that is in the packaging. So when the jelly-like gelatine goes “bad” and turns to liquid, it means the food has gone bad too. But how can you tell that the gelatine, sealed in its little corner on a packet of cheese, has gone bad? The plastic bumps can be felt at the bottom of the triangle because the tough jelly buffer has gone. The gelatine solution mimics the reaction of the food to changing temperatures. If it is kept in the cold, it will remain solid for longer whereas if it is put in warmer conditions such as a car boot or on a kitchen worktop, it will deteriorate quicker, just as a piece of meat would. The amount of gelatine used in packaging reflects the expected lifespan of the food. Smaller amounts of gelatine deteriorate more quickly, so a piece of cooked chicken – which needs to be eaten within days – requires less gelatine than, for instance, a piece of cheese. “This [plastic bump] would be stuck onto the package at the same time as the food is at its freshest and this basically starts decaying at the same time. If you take it out of the fridge, the food starts expiring quicker obviously because of the higher temperature and this is going to start expiring quicker as well,” Pakstaite says. “I have basically taken another food to tell you what is happening to the food inside the package. It is just that this type of food [gelatine] has the unique property of changing states and gelatine has this property of when it completely expires, it releases its bonds because all of the bacteria has eaten those bonds and it turns back into a liquid. So when you run your finger over the top, you can feel the bumps underneath. It is really simple – it is a sandwich which breaks down and reveals the bumps underneath.” The advantage of the system, she says, is that it avoids the existing calculation of best before dates which can be too conservative, resulting in food being thrown out. Under her plans, the Bump Mark would be applied at the time of food packaging so that if crates of food were left for periods outside of refrigeration, the effect on the food would be clear – the gelatine would deteriorate at the same rate as the food. “By having this the store is having to be completely diligent and regimented and honest.” The disadvantage of using gelatine is borne out in the number of vegetarians who have said they would not buy goods that have labelling made from animal by-products, says Pakstaite, adding that she will either source an alternative or limit its use to dairy and meat products. How the system will operate in large-scale food production is not yet clear. One possibility would be for manufacturers to licence the technology and the Bump Mark being activated when the food is packaged although they will have to decide how to ensure the devices are activated at the time of production, she says. Nonetheless, last year the invention won the prestigious James Dyson award, set up by the British inventor to encourage a new generation of design engineers. Outside of the food industry, there is also the possibility that the packaging could be used for fresh cosmetics, also a perishable product. So far, tests have shown the gelatine can be extended to a lifespan of one month, although Pakstaite believes it may last longer. She hopes that the invention could be formally introduced as a part of food packaging by the end of the year, and reduce Britain’s mountain of food waste.",2015-01-25T15:03:04Z,The packaging bump that could cut a 4m tonne mountain of UK food waste,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""dbcd1fe48ba5e0eea1c31f5f40cfdf071ccd3233""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/25/1422197336697/Designer-Solveiga-Pakstai-011.jpg"" alt=""Designer Solveiga Pakstaite, who has developed a bio-reactive food expiry label called Bump Mark."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Designer Solveiga Pakstaite, who has developed a bio-reactive food expiry label called Bump Mark.

"How many portions of fruit and veg should you have each day? The fact that most people in the UK would automatically answer ""five"" or possibly now ""seven"" demonstrates the power of public health messaging.But how transferable are messages on health and sustainability around the world?  Public health issues such as obesity are increasingly an issue in developing countries, and the World Health Organisation (WHO) is currently consulting on whether its official guidelines – that sugar provides no more than 10% of energy intake per day – should be halved to 5%.The question is whether such targets – or any other tactics relating to these shared challenges – are equally applicable to countries as diverse as India, Mexico and the UK.  Are broad global targets helpful? And can messages that have been successful in developed countries be easily applied to developing countries too?""On the whole, public health messaging undoubtedly has a role in improving lives,"" says Anna Glayzer, head of food safety, security and nutrition at consumer voice organisation Consumers International.The European Food Information Council's (Eufic) Dr Laura Fernández, director of nutrition and health, agrees: ""The more information consumers have, the better the decision they will make. Attitudes towards smoking, drink-driving and wearing seat belts and crash-helmets have changed dramatically over time and these successes can be attributed to long-term campaigns reinforcing the message of what constitutes good behaviour.""WHO dietary guidelines not only function as direct global public health messages, but also support targets at a national level, so in that sense they help inform policy in developing countries too.  ""The number of consumers that closely follow WHO policy directly is probably fairly small,"" admits Glayzer.""The hope is that member states will follow up on it. The importance of international standards and targets is more keenly felt in developing countries where there may be no national standards or targets in place.""According to professor Pekka Puska, former director for NCD prevention and health promotion at WHO, public health is ""very much a question of lifestyles and how can we influence lifestyles"". His pioneering work in North Karelia, Finland, in the 1970s is widely seen as the first real community intervention programme.""The message from North Karelia,"" he says, ""is that influencing lifestyles is the most cost-effective, sustainable and cheap way to improve public health.""It could be argued that such campaigns have only been tested in wealthy nations and are therefore less relevant to developing countries, but Puska refutes this.""North Karelia in the 1970s was really poor – there were villages still without electricity, there were small-scale farmers. This is not a high-resource, high-tech issue. It is a question of identifying the risk factors, which are pretty much the same: tobacco kills everywhere – and now sugar, salt, obesity, cholesterol and blood pressure kills everywhere too.""That said, it doesn't necessary follow that you can transpose a successful campaign from one country to another.""Public health messages that are valid in the UK, such as those relating to salt reduction, would not necessarily be directly transferable to India,"" says Fernández. ""What percentage of total calories consumed comes from packaged foods versus meals prepared from scratch? In Asian countries, only about 15% of calories consumed come from packaged foods – the rest is bought from wet markets and hawker food stalls.""Recent research looking at challenges to reducing salt intake among the general population in Asia concluded that raising awareness and interest is crucial: there was a general lack of motivation of participants to change their dietary behaviour. The best communication methods were found to be the most accessible channels – namely, TV and internet.But public campaigns can do more than promote healthier eating. Food waste for developing and developed countries is split fairly evenly across the 1.3bn tonnes wasted globally each year, but the causes are quite different. In the west, most waste occurs at the consumer stage, whereas in developing countries most waste occurs early in the production chain, in particular from poor storage and transport infrastructure.In direct response to this problem, the UN Environment Programme (Unep), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and other partners launched the 'Think.Eat.Save' campaign in 2013 to ""add authority and voice to ... galvanize widespread global, regional and national actions, [and] catalyze more sectors of society to be aware and to act"".The words of the Think.Eat.Save campaign hint at something professor Puska first discovered in North Karelia: campaigns only work with a groundswell of public support. If they actually start from within the community, then so much the better.India, for example, has seen grassroots poster campaigns targeting the vast food waste experienced at wedding halls and students' hostels. In China too, over-consumption is a big problem among an increasingly wealthy middle-class, despite hunger and malnutrition remaining major issues for the rural poor.When campaigner Xu Zhijun began 'Operation empty plate' on Weibo (the Chinese version of Twitter) to encourage people to finish their meals when eating out, he ""assumed it would fade out like other Weibo campaigns"". However, the empty plate he ""tweeted"" went viral and received public endorsement from the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping.There is also evidence that labels such as Fairtrade – once seen as of exclusive interest to rich western consumers – are beginning to be valued by consumers in the global south. Rather than necessarily focusing on the ""fairness"", however, consumers in India, for example, are seen to value the quality and safety of domestic products certified by international standards.The 'think global, act local' mantra, therefore, may be apt. The problems and challenges embedded in our global food system are increasingly shared by all, but dealing with them still requires tailored national buy-in and action. ""It's really an interaction,"" says Puska. ""People pull government and government pulls people.""This content is brought to you by Guardian Global Development Professionals Network in association with Tesco.

"Few people visit Peru for contemporary culture. Most tourists head straight to Cusco and Machu Picchu, with just a stop-off in the capital, Lima. But this summer, style magazine Dazed and Confused described Lima as an “unexpected new art world star”. Next spring, British Airways will launch the only direct UK flight to the city, and its food scene, at the forefront of Peru’s cultural renaissance for a decade or so, continues to be praised globally. I joined Nora Sugobono, food writer for newspaper El Commercial, at Isolina, an earthy yet modern restaurant in the Barranco district that has been called the biggest opening of the year. It serves large bowls of classic Limeño home cooking and is part of a new wave of relaxed restaurants offering reasonably priced but impeccably prepared food – mains cost around £10. Another is nearby Sibaris, opened two years, which also operates a food truck. And chef Virgilio Martinez, who played an integral role in raising the profile of Peruvian cuisine, has just opened a casual restaurant, Nos, up the road from his chart-topping Central restaurant in upscale Miraflores. “Gastronomy changed the whole city,” said Nora. “And that opened up opportunities for fashion, art and more.”     Modern twist … Isolina, in the barranco district    In recent years the number of galleries, design shops and indie food joints in the Barranco and Miraflores districts has swelled, with boutique Hotel B capitalising on Barranco’s upwards swing and growing appetite for local artisan fare. I found locals cramming into gourmet gelateria BLUfor an (excellent) ice cream and nearby brewpub the Barranco Beer Company, opened two years ago. Contemporary art fairs ArtLima and PArC are helping develop a new audience for visual arts in the city, and Mario Testino’s museum, MATE, which opened in 2012, is another symbol of growing pride in Peru (and Lima), from one of its best-known creatives. One homegrown artist now enjoying widespread popularity is “Peruvian Warhol” Cherman Kino Ganoza, whose pop art prints can be seen everywhere – including boutique B&amp;B Casa Nuestra, in Barranco. His Miraflores gallery/shop, La Kasa Roja, also has work by other local graphic artists. Also hanging on walls in Lima, and painted on them too, is work by Elliot Tupac, a sign writer whose classic Chicha style has gained him international acclaim.      Mario Testino’s MATE photography museum. Photograph: Alamy    The city has a fledgling cycling scene, too: Lima Fixed Bikes, who are poised to open a new shop in run Miraflores, run thrice weekly rides around the city that anyone is welcome to join (they’ll lend you a bike if you need one and, don’t worry, a fixie isn’t compulsory). That evening I headed out to one of Lima’s leading underground club nights, CasaLoCasa, held that night in an old salsa house, a red and white painted colonial building in Barranco. Street style isn’t huge in the Peruvian capital, but here fashionable young Limeans are queuing for entry; clothes lean towards black, while at least three people brighten the queue with neon dyed hair. Smoking outside was the night’s co-founder Herles Falconi (with green hair and green t-shirt under unbuttoned purple shirt) and his girlfriend Elisa, who runs arts space La Centralita. When it comes to nightlife, “in the past two years Lima has burst culturally,” he told me, explaining how more and more events are now booking international DJs and producers. Vao Vao and Bulbo are among the nights to check out, and local duo Dengue Dengue Dengue – who combine tropical bass with performance and visual arts – now have a reach way beyond the city.  Herles’ girlfriend, Elisa, says this creative confidence is causing a buzz in Lima: “Cultural manifestations that we’ve neglected before are getting more consideration now,” she tells me - pointing to the appreciation of work by the likes of Chermen and Tupac, as well as wider attention from international media. “It was only a matter of time.” Accommodation was provided by Casa Nuestra B&amp;B (doubles from £32, no phone, casanuestraperu.com) ",2015-09-05T06:00:02Z,Newly buzzing Lima vies with Peru’s ancient sites for visitor attention,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""895dcc03a80054e97721d64561ae2aa84de4d3b3""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/4/1441382767138/601815dd-7b8b-4af7-bf8f-3c67e9496e21-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Síbaris, Lima, Peru"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Scene setter … Síbaris bar and restaurant</span> </figcaption> </figure>",13,"Tourists who once made a beeline for Machu Picchu are now finding the contemporary art and food scene of Peru’s capital, Lima, as much of a draw",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/4/1441382767623/601815dd-7b8b-4af7-bf8f-3c67e9496e21-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/sep/05/contemporary-art-and-food-scene-lima-peru,1,positive
"Add this to the list of things I never thought I would attempt: seeking out cat food at a fashionable cafe and then tasting it. Voluntarily. To be sure, it is gourmet, small-batch, Brooklyn-made, locally sourced cat food. Matt Rosenberg, who first developed the recipe, tells me the multivitamin in it is made for humans.  Rosenberg, along with co-founders Jenny Tran and Shabnam Azadeh, started their company, called From Scratch, in 2012. They use human-grade ingredients to make premium cat food that is stored in the freezer, unlike conventional shelf-safe cat food. Even though Rosenberg “hates to use the word artisanal”, you could argue their production is just that. While there are any number of pet lovers who will whip up a special dinner for their fluffy soulmates at home, making commercial cat food is another story.  The industry does have its regulations, and unlike human food, cat food has to be nutritionally sound. Cats, it seems, can’t live on Twinkies and Cheetos like the rest of us. Rosenberg spent a lot of time researching cat nutrition to get the recipe just right, and had it tested in a lab to make sure all the amino acids, minerals and other needs of a cat would be met. Locally sourced cat food might sound a little extreme, but Rosenberg says he gets calls from people complaining that From Scratch food is cooked when their cats are “on a strictly raw Paleo diet”, or asking if the oats in the food were processed in a facility that also processes foods with gluten – which makes artisanal cat food sound pretty ordinary by comparison. From Scratch at one point held the distinction of being the only offering for non-humans at the weekly Brooklyn foodie market Smorgasburg. The makers stopped attending this year because most of the customers they found perusing their wares were from out of town, and there is a limit to the number of times you can tell a nice German couple that taking frozen cat food on a plane back home is probably not a good idea.     A purrfect meal? Photograph: &lt;a href=&quot;http://fromscratchpetfood.com&quot;&gt;From Scratch&lt;/a&gt;    But From Scratch still markets its food at other human-only institutions.  I ventured to Williamsburg in search of fresh cat food to try. I don’t have a cat, but I figured I could momentarily skip forward to my senior years to test out what all the fuss was about. The manager at Urban Rustic, which sells Porto Rico Importing Co coffee and fresh sandwiches near the park, told me the store was all out of the feline meal. At Gourmet Guild, an upscale cafe that carries fine (human) foods, Jee Song, an employee, lit up. From Scratch had a real following of diehard fans, she said, but Gourmet Guild has not carried it in a while. It was hard to get customers to think about going to the fridge for cat food, she explained, but pet food is moving towards human-grade ingredients and small, fresh batches. Those guys are ahead of their time, she wistfully assured me. My last stop was the only actual pet store on my list, PS9 Pets, a cute little place full of tiny kittens rolling around in front of a giant cage. They had just sold out, they told me after a careful inspection of two fridges. A woman who had come in earlier that day had walked out with the last four containers. And so, alas, my cat food-tasting adventures were not meant to be. Fortunately for me, Rosenberg and his partners had done the tasting already. So what does cat food with human-grade meat (specifically turkey leg) and no preservatives taste like? According to Rosenberg, it is like a bland turkey pâté, with maybe just the tiniest sour note from the multivitamin. I am not sure that sounds that much better than Purina.",2015-09-01T13:00:12Z,"From Scratch: locally sourced, small-batch cuisine – for cats","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-c072f823-99f7-41b6-afac-95a3497f7852""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/31/1441038381516/2ac539bd-5221-404e-8e90-808022a89650-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Ethical cat?

"On progressive economics Larry Elliott’s comment piece, The next financial crash starts right here (28 August) is in many ways insightful. He explains the fallacy which underlies quantitative easing, in addition to the inevitable consequence, growing inequity both within and between nations. However, Elliott’s proposed solution falls into the same trap as the problem he diagnoses: the assumption of an infinite global market, together with the need for never-ending growth in extraction, manufacture and consumption. In addition, he rather fondly hopes for a new, improved brand of capitalism to emerge, wherein a magical entity will wave a wand called international policy cooperation, thus enabling a cost-free, equitable and steady increase in overall economic growth and productivity. I wonder if Elliott and I are living on the same planet? Sadly his view seems to reflect that of many “progressive economists”: more of the same, please, but this time let’s all be nicer about it.Noel BirdBoreen Point, Queensland, Australia Corbyn’s Labour appeal Gordon Brown asserts that Jeremy Corbyn would make the UK Labour party one of protest rather than of government (21 August). Certainly Corbyn seems more alive and vital than his fellow candidates, and has attracted many followers, but why? Two main strands give succour to Corbyn. Firstly there’s disillusion with politicians’ acquiescence to large corporations and their all too often damaging environmental developments. Then there is disillusion with the large corporations themselves. Is it any wonder Labour supporters seek a more liberated political spirit who will protest on their behalf? Particularly, as one might suspect, a person who is savvy enough to adjust and temper his more alienating positions as time goes on. In the same edition, Martin Kettle draws an analogy between present day Labour and the Liberal party in the 1930s, citing the common condition of a movement shackled by historic decline. He believes a Corbyn-led party would be a minority party, further contributing to the death or near death of Labour. But what if Corbyn can resonate with voters who are sick of present-day political and corporate cynicism? It’s a long shot that Corbyn could emerge as a powerful leader appealing to a wide enough audience to hold government, but it just may happen.David CatchloveNewport, New South Wales, Australia The language of migration I agree absolutely with the sentiments expressed by David Murray (Please give us more hope, Reply, 21 August) in his incisive critique of the media’s “hate-filled xenophobic debate about refugees and migrants”. The use of language to degrade has a long and sordid history in terms of the centuries-long British Imperial project. However, as the evidence of recent months proves, Britain is not unique in this type of racist rhetoric. The Irish media reflects its right-wing British peers by dehumanising men, women and children with the callous use of terms like “economic migrants” to describe people who are desperately fleeing persecution in their chaotic and war torn homelands. Imagine the media storm if a commentator used this template in a revisionist commentary on the million and a half Irish men, women and children who fled starvation in the Great Famine of the 19th century. Or to bring a contemporary face to Irish economic migration, the estimated 50,000 illegal Irish in the United States, none of whom fled the murder, torture or rape that would surely have been the fate of those vulnerable people who risk their lives to cross the Mediterranean. Dr Kevin McCarthyKinsale, Ireland • David Murray’s moving letter on proactive optimism reminds me of John Fowles, who I think held the most powerful pen in England, in his early Notebooks: “the world needs a system between communism and capitalism.”Edward BlackSydney, New South Wales, Australia Food and famine Jonathan Kent flags two issues in his emotive piece, We could end famine if we cut food waste (21 August), but goes on to address only one of them. There was nothing new in what he tells us about the statistics of food waste in Britain, nor in the pop psychology that we’ve all heard by now – that we are more likely to make bad decisions about buying food when we are hungry. So how exactly will cutting food waste in the west relieve famine-struck people? It won’t, and perhaps an article examining why would have filled the space better.Gabby WhitworthSouth Hobart, Tasmania, Australia Save the phytoplankton  Thank you for your succinctly scarifying editorial on anthropogenic threats to marine wellbeing (We should care more and invest more, 14 August). One of the issues raised, ocean acidification driven by rising levels of atmospheric carbon, threatens not just visible species like shellfish and coral, but microscopic phytoplankton or diatoms, single-celled algae so small a million dwell in a litre of seawater. There are more than 10,000 species, each as exquisitely and diversely patterned as snowflakes. They generate half Earth’s oxygen - every second breath we draw is their gift - catalyse cloud formation hence weather, are a major carbon sink, and the lynchpin of the marine foodchain. Phytoplankton cannot form skeletons in acidifying oceans; we are sabotaging a vast, powerful, invisible ecosystem on whose health our own depends. A biospheric matrix is dying. The angels weep.Annie MarchWest Hobart, Tasmania, Australia Lowering population growth I was dismayed by the editorial (7 August) rejecting population control because it argues that carbon emissions rise faster as population growth slows. Correlation is not causation. Socio-economic growth brings about lower population growth and increased consumption, thus greater carbon emissions if consumption increases faster than the reduction in population. Lower population growth is a consequence, not a cause, of socio-economic growth. It remains true that, the more people there are, the more carbon emissions there will be at a given level of consumption per capita. Reduced fertility will not save the environment, but it is one essential strategy among many. The world needs not only a lower population growth, but a significant reduction in the human population. This will not be achieved easily, but it is crucial to do so. We are not only exhausting the world’s reserves of fossil fuels, but also of fresh water (depleted aquifers and glaciers) and other crucial resources. Without a managed reduction in world population, there will be more negative impacts on quality of life and on biodiversity; eventually, desertification, disturbed monsoons, malnutrition and infectious diseases will bring about disruptive die-offs.Jérôme RousseauSaint-Lazare, Quebec, Canada Briefly • Re John Harris on assisted dying and one’s golden years (14 August), no 45-year-old can ever understand what it feels like to be 70 because... damn. What was that point I was going to make? Oh well, I’ll make a note next time. Oops, I dropped the pen. Oops, I dropped it again. Got the pen, now what is going on with my knee, last week it was my hip acting up. What was that point? Oh, now I remember, it is the steady diminishing of your faculties and deterioration of body parts, reduced financial resources and the vast sense of losing control of one’s life that makes the prospect of death seem less … damn, what was that point?Billie LondonSt Augustine, Florida, US • Am I mistaken, or are the baby undulate rays (Eyewitnessed, 21 August) smiling at each other?

But hopefully not food on the table.R M FranssonWheat Ridge, Colorado, US • Enigmatists will have noted the subtle cryptic message in the Comment &amp; Debate section about the recent atomic deal with Iran (21 August).

"Forget eggs and bacon. Farewell smashed avo. The new way to start your day is with a breakfast bowl filled with kale, berries or quinoa. These colourful bowls packed with so-called superfoods and costing up to $18 at a cafe, may be the flavour of the month, but demand for them is being driven by people with a lot of Instagram followers but not necessarily nutritional qualifications. If you haven’t come across a breakfast bowl before, just take a look at Instagram where more than 40,000 posts are tagged as #breakfastbowl. More often than not the picture will also be tagged as #rawfood #cleaneating and #superfood.   Related: Green is the new black: the unstoppable rise of the healthy-eating guru    The appeal of breakfast bowls lies not just in the way they photograph but also in the inclusion of various superfoods. A typical breakfast bowl includes allegedly super and certainly expensive ingredients such as Brazilian acai berries as well as almonds that have been “activated” by 12 hours of soaking.  At the Dandylion in Bondi you can order an Amazonia acai bowl filled with granola and fresh fruit, while Patch cafe in Melbourne offers a bircher bowl with activated hazelnuts and almonds, goji berries and coconut yoghurt for a crunchy gluten- and dairy-free alternative to traditional bircher muesli.  Jayde Hwang, manager at Patch, says the rise of the breakfast bowl comes down to a desire to be healthy as well as the taste. “A lot of people who come here are health-conscious,” she says. “Especially on the weekend we often have a line of people wanting to get in.” Hwang is evangelical about her job and about healthy eating.   Related: Not all cuisines are created equal, so which country has the worst food?    “I’d hate to work somewhere I didn’t believe in,” she says. “I’d feel like I’m feeding people shit, and I wouldn’t be happy about it.”  Lola Berry, author of The Happy Cookbook, is also a fan of the breakfast bowl, and has recipes for an acai bowl and chai breakfast pudding in her book. Berry often advocates the benefits of breakfast bowls across her Instagram and Facebook feeds which boast 170,000 followers. Berry says she first came across breakfast bowls in Hawaii and was quickly hooked. “It’s a fun way to eat,” she says. “It’s a really good way to add a lot of nutrients into one bowl.” Berry acknowledges part of the appeal in an age of social media is the whole look of breakfast bowls with their colourful hues and #cleaneating bragging rights.  “It is a bright-coloured breakfast; it’s almost like you’re eating art.” Berry says the popularity of breakfast bowls can be linked to the rise in health consciousness among Australians.     It is a bright coloured breakfast; it’s almost like you’re eating art    “I think people are just more in touch with their body and they realise ‘when I eat real food I feel awesome, when I eat junk food I don’t feel good’,” she says.  “When you realise the effect food can have on your brain and mood you realise how important it is.” Berry is a nutritionist as well as an author, but many of the food writers, wellness bloggers and social media celebrities advocating wellness have no qualifications. This lack of regulation has come under increased scrutiny after blogger and author Belle Gibson falsely claimed she cured herself of cancer through her diet. But Berry says qualifications aren’t necessary to tout wellness and health.  She has just completed a “What should I eat?” seminar tour with Sarah Wilson and David Gillespie, who she describes as “amazing food writers”. “They don’t have qualifications but they have done their research,” Berry says.

With social media these days you have to be real and authentic and people will see that.”  But Zoe Yates, lecturer at the school of biomedical sciences and pharmacy at the University of Newcastle, says authenticity only goes so far when it comes to science.   “They haven’t got the background in how the body works, metabolism, and biochemistry,” she says. “We all have different genetic makeup and metabolise food differently. We are all in different stages of our life cycle as well and nutrition needs throughout your life cycle change and are very different.” Yates is concerned about the hype around breakfast bowls filled with superfoods such as acai.  “It might be for breakfast we have these superfoods that are more expensive but we might think ‘What is the functional property? What is it that makes us think these are super’,” Yates says. “If you just have oats would people label them super? They are low cost, have low glycaemic index, which makes them healthy, take longer to be digested and absorbe and give you a feeling of fullness throughout the day which stops you snacking.”  Yates says rather than eating breakfast bowls filled with exotic and expensive ingredients, humble porridge with a handful of berries can be just as good.  “It’s more about sensible eating,” she says. “There’s no doubt [breakfast bowls] are healthy and better than sugared cereals or toast and peanut butter for breakfast.” The danger lies in eating a breakfast bowl for breakfast and then thinking you can eat whatever you want for the rest of the day, according to Yates.  “If you do have healthy food for breakfast it will obviously have a health benefit but if you are going to eat rubbish throughout the day or later it counterbalances out,” she says.

"By the time your salad greens have been picked, packed, washed and shipped to the supermarket, they’re devoid of almost all nutrients. At least that’s what the food blogger Tamar Haspel says. We’d be better off giving up on lettuce altogether, given all the fossil fuels that go into farming, transportation and storage, she argued recently in the Washington Post.   Related: Liberate your salads! | Everlasting Meals with Tamar Adler    If the social media response to the article was anything to go by, though, people weren’t overly concerned that the food being farmed, paid for and fed to them was basically an overpriced garnish. The feeling was one of relief: someone was making a public argument against eating salad. Finally, the perfect excuse not to do that thing you’ve always hated! Thanks, science!  It might seem like all this salad-shaming is rather silly, but it’s worth asking why, if so many people hate salad that much, we eat it at all.  Partly, Haspel is right: as a source of nutrients, salad staples such as iceberg lettuce, cucumber and celery are at the lower end of the scale. The body runs on kilojoules – or calories, depending on which side of the US border you live – and the caloric content of these crunchy greens is negligible, since they are comprised mostly of water.  In terms of vitamins, even lettuce grown on your own doorstep offers only a fraction of the human body’s daily requirements. But this is also part of the reason why such foods are so revered in the contemporary west: eating salad greens is as close as one can get to eating nothing at all, and in world in which we still haven’t escaped the trappings of the beauty myth, to eat as little as possible is still considered virtuous.     On one hand, there’s The Biggest Loser. On the other, there’s salad.    This idea that particular foods are “good” while others are inherently sinful is an old trope of the Judeo-Christian tradition, while advertising both appeals to and reinforces this cultural narrative. Such narratives are also gendered: if you’re not a woman laughing alone with salad, then you’re either being seduced by forbidden delights (less likely to be apples than chocolate) or replacing such temptations with yoghurt.  This is coupled with a pervasive cultural fear of fat, and an enormous market built on the demonisation of any and all of the average person’s awkward flabby bits. On one hand, there’s The Biggest Loser. On the other, there’s salad. No wonder we’re all feeling bullied into dietary banality.  Eating doesn’t have to be this fraught. Most of us could do with a little less food angst and a little more confidence in our own ability to make the choices that are right for us.  Over the past decade or so, the Health At Every Size movement has been building momentum against this kind of “fat-shaming” culture that contributes to the development of pathologies about food, and health-conscious communities against dieting, such as the Moderation Movement, have only been growing.  One of the objectives all these groups have in common is the decoupling of food from the concept of morality, and encouraging people to feel less guilty about their day-to-day choices and to focus more on their overall wellbeing.  That’s not to say there aren’t ethical, environmental and political questions to be asked about food, such as: under what conditions is it farmed? Are the workers paid fairly? Are there less resource-intensive and more sustainable ways to organise food production? But these aren’t questions that can be solved with personal angst over a dinner plate.

"We have no problem scoring restaurants, ranking them or handing out awards, but what about an entire cuisine? Can we really say that one country’s food is better than another’s? Personal preference counts for a lot but it can’t obscure the truth that not all cuisines are created equal.   Related: Adam Liaw: my list of five simple tips that will help make you a better cook    Part of the problem with trying to compare cuisines is that it’s hard to find an objective standard. Taste is king but there’s no single benchmark for it. Lovers of the spices and seasonings in Issan Thai salads might look down at the great British Sunday roast as unbearably bland. So let’s try sophistication. Certainly French dining is more refined than the homey one-pot wonders of the Philippines, but is that even relevant? Why eat an ortolan, force feed a goose for its liver or rummage around in the mud with pigs for a truffle? Surely rarity has no bearing on how good something tastes. Similarly there are those who might say that Japanese food’s pursuit of aesthetics and philosophy is a big old pile of tosh, preferring the relaxed conviviality of an Italian family table. And they might well be right. If the popularity of a cuisine was the benchmark of its quality you’d have to say Chinese food is a clear winner, loved from the Australian outback to small-town Peru and New York City, not to mention the billion-plus who eat it three times a day in China. But then McDonald’s is popular, too, so does that make American cuisine the best in the world? Global influence? That might put Portuguese food on top of the leaderboard. For centuries it has inspired dishes as diverse as Indian vindaloo, Japanese tempura, and Brazilian feijoada.  Certainly the job of comparing cuisines is not a simple one, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be done. The truth is there are countries where the quality of the food just isn’t very good.  I’m sure aficionados of Cuban cuisine consider it rich and varied but my experience there involved imported tinned vegetables and stingy sandwiches filled with cheap processed meat. Even the mojitos, which should have been a slam dunk, suffered from a country-wide shortage of mint. It’s a cuisine that’s on the bad end of decades of economic hardship but to excuse its shortcomings as just a matter of personal preference is silly. In Scandinavia many Norwegians seem to live on a steady diet of frozen pizza, which is not a great endorsement for a traditional cuisine dominated by meat stewed with root vegetables. I like Norwegian food but even I can’t truthfully say its overall quality is on par with that of French or Japanese.    Saying a country’s food isn’t good isn’t necessarily an attack but more a recognition that times are always changing    And these are just the cuisines I know about. Is there anyone who wants to honestly tell me that the food of Gabon, Tajikistan or Qatar is as worthy of praise as that of Vietnam, Spain or Mexico? I’m open minded, but the fact that Gabonese restaurants aren’t popping up on every street corner is, in my book, a bit of clue. A country’s cuisine is a part of its cultural identity. It can be a source of pride, a catalyst for tourism and even a vehicle for soft power. As such, criticism of it can be dangerous territory, exposing the critic to claims of ignorance, poor taste or even xenophobia. Yet we needn’t be so thin skinned.  Saying a country’s food isn’t very good isn’t necessarily an attack but more a recognition that times are always changing. Even British cuisine, once the whipping boy of western European food, has undergone such a resurgence that the French are throwing Michelin stars across the channel. Perhaps now with hindsight we might admit there was a period when it wasn’t very good.  I wouldn’t go back to Cuba for the food right now, but give it a decade and I might be on to a winner. In the meantime, if someone could point me in the direction of a decent Gabonese buffet, it’d be much appreciated.

"Climate change will have irreversible and unprecedented impacts on crucial ocean microorganisms that could trigger dramatic effects further up the food chain, according to scientists.  The bacteria trichodesmium is known for surviving in nutrient-poor parts of the ocean, where it converts nitrogen gas into a material that can be used by other forms of life – from plankton to whales – which all require it to grow.  This process of “nitrogen fixation” makes the bacteria “the fertilising agent of the open ocean”, says Eric Webb, co-author of the study published in Nature Communications. Although a microorganism, it forms in colonies that can be seen by the naked eye, earning it the name “sea sawdust”. When the scientists placed it in conditions simulating carbon dioxide levels in 85 years’ time, the bacteria went into reproductive overdrive. The scientists say that this could cause it to go into reproductive overdrive in the future, consuming vast quantities of nutrients – such as iron and phosphorus – that are in limited supply in the ocean. This could leave other organisms that depend on the same nutrients without enough to survive. Alternatively, greater numbers of trichodesmium could consume the resources at an unsustainable rate, creating the conditions for its own extinction. This could in turn leave other organisms without the products processed through “nitrogen fixation” by the bacteria, triggering catastrophic effects much further up the marine food chain, on creatures such as fish. When the same bacteria was then put back into present day conditions the behaviour change was unexpectedly discovered to be permanent. The scientists say that the finding that the bacteria would “get stuck in the fast lane” calls into question basic evolutionary principles. Webb told the Guardian: “The fact it grows fast and gets stuck in that state is unprecedented in evolutionary biology and could have dramatic effects on its natural, very-low nutrient oceanic habitat. This unchecked growth will likely cause it to produce nitrogen, but it will also consume other nutrients at increased rates. As these nutrients are predicted to be more scarce in the future, the combination of these factors could lead to its extinction in the worst case scenario.” The researchers bred the bacteria over the course of five years at carbon dioxide levels predicted for 2100 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Scientists say that more research is now needed to establish why this irreversible evolution occurs.  Prof Toby Tyrrell at the national oceanography centre at the University of Southampton, who did not work on the project, said: “It’s remarkable that the effect of high CO2 is seen to persist even when the cells are returned to low CO2. This is surprising. It’s not obvious why such an effect should occur.  “It’s possible that it will not hold true in nature though. Previous studies showing short-term increases in nitrogen fixation at high CO2 were found to disappear when the cells were grown under more realistic conditions.”",2015-09-02T12:04:43Z,Climate change will alter ocean bacteria crucial to food chain – study,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""f1f6c2f442a0885ad7862b52dc83012a587327d4""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/2/1441194508511/9a414d8b-204a-428a-a37e-8ffcd130ce6e-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Cyanobacteria, Trichodesmium, bloom off Queensland, Australia"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A <em>trichodesmium</em> or ‘sea sawdust’ bloom off the coast of Queensland, Australia.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>",19,Irreversible changes to <em>trichodesmium </em>microorganisms could effect species from plankton to whales that depend on products it consumes or produces<em><br></em>,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/2/1441194508865/0d26f225-6e7c-458a-9c4a-d53c62278f65-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/02/climate-change-will-alter-ocean-micro-organisms-crucial-to-food-chain-say-scientists,2,neutral
"As the world goes from seven billion mouths to feed to nearly 10 billion by 2050, the pressure is on to produce 70% more food than today without harming the environment. It is a huge task that has prompted the G8 countries and 120 governments and organisations around the world to to set up and support the Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition (Godan) initiative. It encourages governments to open up data and help each other’s farmers learn from the information. According to its programme director, Martin Parr, it is the only way a growing population will be fed.   Related: All the data you need to power your business is free online    “The world needs a new agricultural revolution and that’s going to come through a data revolution,” he says.  “We need to open up data so farmers can be more efficient and get the biggest yields possible and use the least amount of agrochemicals because we’ve got to have this new data-driven revolution in agriculture without any detriment to the environment. The only way to do this is to open up data but then encourage organisations around the world to turn the data in to open services which offer useful, evidence-based advice to farmers.” Parr’s organisation, and other open data campaigners, welcomed the Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs (Defra) embracing open data at the end of June with the full release of 8,000 data sets. The point now is organisations must use the data and combine with other information, such as weather records or plant health imaging from satellites, to make truly useful services. Godan has published case studies of what is already possible globally. Examples include the Netherlands government using satellite data to warn against mice infestations as well as Colombian farmers and American policymakers forecasting water requirements against reserves so this valuable natural resource can be optimised. Predicting pests While the UK waits for data that was only made available two months ago to be turned in to live services by environmentalists, farming organisations and, no doubt, digital startups, farmers around the globe are already benefiting from one pioneering farming authority. Oxfordshire-based CABI works with multiple governments and farming organisations across Africa, America, Europe and Asia to share the insights from its scientific records into plants’ risk from pests which go back more than one hundred years. The Plantwise data service is free and offers proactive advice on dealing with each specific threat where natural measures are promoted above use of agrochemicals, which is always placed as a last resort. The next step is to combine this data with current and predicted weather as well as on-the-ground observations, according to Tim Holmes, head of technical solutions at CABI’s Plantwise Knowledge Bank. “We’ve run a test project in Kenya to use the data we have on crops’ vulnerability to pests and combined it with satellite weather data so we can forewarn which are likely to be a problem,” he says. “The service offers a traffic light warning system with advice on what farmers can do for each different threat level, starting with good farming practice – such as pruning trees and bushes and keeping the farm clean – right up to the last resort of applying a particular insecticide.” With mobile phone providers keen to have an extra service to make their tariffs more tempting, Holmes reveals CABI is in talks with networks to offer the service to other emerging markets. The organisation is also in talks about developing a particularly futuristic service with Zhejiang University to control locusts in China. “China has agreed to dramatically reduce the pesticides it sprays to combat locusts by 2020 and so they realise open data is going to be key,” says Holmes. “We’re hoping to combine our Plantwise data with satellite weather system along with radar images which can pick up insect movements. The resulting service could then offer warnings and advice to farmers, based on their location, with pesticide use as the last resort.” Mapping out farming Investors are used to staring at screens packed with business data before making decisions and now, thanks to open data, agriculture is no different. Charles Elworthy, head of research at Map of Agriculture, reveals the company’s new service combines UK and internationally available data to show how productive areas around the world are for different types of farming. “Agriculture’s an attractive investment opportunity because of the appreciation of land assets but, until now, investors haven’t had firm data on where farming is the most productive,” he says. “We offer maps with different layers that allow you to see production for different farming types so investors can establish what their return on assets may be. We’re a very small startup right now but we’re hoping to share our findings with farming organisations and with farmers who supply us with data, and then charge investors for accessing it.” Partner approach Some projects involve partners sharing data with one another, such as at seed and agrochemical company Syngenta. While it is not strictly open data as defined by the Open Definition, it gives its farming customers access to the results of surveys into farming practices at 800 farms in 41 countries. The data enables farmers to benchmark performance against one another explains Elisabeth Fischer, project manager for Sygenta’s global Good Growth Plan. “Our surveys allow farmers to compare yield per hectare as well as how much water and pesticides they used,” she says. “The farmers we survey are our customers but we hope to widen the project by working with third parties in the future. We’re also planning to build up the service so it has sensors which combine soil and weather data so farmers can get a more like-for-like comparison.” The hope is that such partner-based networks will combine their findings with other farming organisations’ data research projects to give improved insight to those who can benefit from it most. Without offering farmers the best possible data on how they can grow more with less reliance on pesticides, experts predict the world will not get the revolution in agriculture it needs to grow the required 70% more food within 35 years.

"The number of Ethiopians who will need food aid by the end of this year has surged by more than 1.5 million from earlier estimates, according to United Nations agencies. After failed rains, some 4.5m people are now projected to require assistance, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) , the World Food Programme and the UN children’s agency, Unicef, said. This is an increase of 55% on initial projections of 2.9 million, and means donors must urgently provide an extra $230m to meet these needs. Gillian Mellsop, Unicef representative and acting humanitarian coordinator, said donors had been generous but more was needed to prevent unnecessary human suffering. “The situation facing us today marks a significant change in our plans, requiring the scaling up of assistance, now,” she said.   Related: Despite border crackdown in Ethiopia, migrants still risk lives to leave    Ethiopia is one of Africa’s fastest-growing economies, with nearly double-digit growth every year for the last decade, but failed rains have had devastating consequences for food supplies for its 96 million people. “The belg rains were much worse than the National Meteorology Agency predicted at the beginning of the year. Food insecurity increased and malnutrition rose as a result,” said David Del Conte, Ocha’s acting head of office in Ethiopia, referring to the short rainy season that stretches from February to April. Areas normally producing surplus food in the central Oromia region were also affected by shortages, and lack of water has affected livestock there and in other pastoralist areas, the agencies said. In its August report on Ethiopia, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (Fewsnet), said unusual livestock deaths and unseasonal migration were continuing and livestock prices and demand had fallen sharply. There was very little rain during the first three weeks of July, and the June-to-September rainfall was well below average in most eastern, central and southern crop-producing areas.  Dry conditions would be exacerbated by the start of the dry season in September and October, it added. “With continued high cereal prices, low livestock prices, and no expected increase in other income sources, poor households will be unable to purchase sufficient quantities of food and [will] have food consumption gaps. Acute malnutrition prevalence is likely to increase,” Fewsnet said. Meteorologists have also warned that the El Niño weather phenomenon, marked by a warming of sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, is now well established and continues to strengthen. Models indicate that sea-surface temperature anomalies in the central Pacific Ocean are set to climb to their highest in 19 years. El Niño can lead to scorching weather across Asia and east Africa, and heavy rains and floods in South America. The UN cautioned that the anomaly could further affect Ethiopia’s kiremt rains, which stretch from June to September. “A failed belg followed by a poor kiremt season means that challenges could continue into next year,” said John Aylieff, WFP’s Ethiopia representative. Ethiopia is heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for almost half of its gross domestic product. Around three-quarters of its population are farmers, with many involved in subsistence farming, rain-fed farming or livestock production. While the poverty rate fell from 39% to 26% between 2005 and 2013, nearly 20 million people live below the UN poverty threshold of $1.25 (£0.80) a day.

"It is difficult to know which is moving faster: the debate around the ethics of farmed fish, or the growth in how much of it we are eating. By 2030, aquaculture is predicted to account for 60% of fish destined for our plates and it’s already more than half. Its rapid growth has led some to predict its success in producing cheaper fish could rub off on the meat sector, giving us a more efficient, but not necessarily more ethical, form of protein. Farmed fish have in the past been seen as the saviour of overfishing. The more we could produce in caged farms and ponds, the theory went, the fewer we would need from the sea. Then we found out that most of the wild fish being caught were being used to feed the fish in the cages, and the benefits suddenly seemed a lot less clear. Fish feed companies have reacted to the criticism by developing more land-based alternatives to marine feed and, as people get worried about palm oil and soy, by looking to algae, seaweed and even insects.    Salmon farming has the most efficient animal feed in the world  Piers Hart, WWF     Given that feed has always been the biggest cost for fish producers, the sector has focused on creating less wasteful, more sustainable feed. In the salmon sector, where feed accounts for 60% of costs, the feed conversion rate (the amount of feed needed to produce a given amount of fish meat) has shrunk, with 1kg of fish taking 1.4kg of feed to produce.  Just a decade ago WWF was lamenting the large numbers of wild fish being fed to caged farm fish: “Four kgs of wild-caught fish are needed to produce 1kg of farmed fish,” it said.  Today WWF aquaculture expert Piers Hart says salmon farming has the “most efficient animal feed in the world”. In fact, since fish only makes up a proportion of the feed given to salmon, along with vegetable meal and oils, many farms are reported to be using 1kg or less of wild fish for each kg of salmon produced. Imagine how much the cost of beef could fall if it could match such progress. It currently takes around 10kg of feed to produce just 1kg of beef. From fish to chicken It is this technological advance that is likely to have spurred Cargill – one of the world’s largest food companies – to spend £1bn buying up the Norwegian salmon-feed supplier Ewos. If it can use some of Ewos’ knowhow in its livestock business, so the thinking goes, it could save millions of dollars in feed and production costs. Ewos has nearly halved the quantity of marine ingredients used in feed in the past decade, according to Cargill. Hart believes the real interest for Cargill is in the expertise it gains in making feed more efficient, rather than being a big player in the salmon sector. “I don’t think it is seeing much growth in salmon, where expansion and production costs are high. It wants to transfer the [feed] technology to other sectors, such as tilapia and its poultry business.”   Related: Is it now ethical to eat farmed fish? | Lucy Siegle    Tilapia, along with carp and catfish, is expected to see the biggest growth over the next 15 years, according to the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). Global tilapia production is predicted to almost double between 2010 and 2030, driven by growth in south-east Asia, in part because of its ease of production compared with salmon and other carnivorous fish such as trout.  But for Cargill, the benefits for its poultry interests could be just as big. The switch away from marine-based feed means fish and poultry feed are now very similar, says Hart. And along with fish, the poultry sector is set to account for the vast majority of the growth in animal protein over the next decade, with chicken predicted to surge past pork as the world’s most popular meat by 2020. Sustainable, but not ethical So will the transfer of expertise from salmon farms to the rest of the fish and livestock sector mean more sustainable protein for consumers?  Only if companies are pushed or incentivised to make improvements, suggests Hart. With such high feed costs, the salmon sector has a long history of pressure to be as efficient as possible. Its shift away from marine-based feed happened in part for economic reasons, adds Hart, with the sector heavily dependent on Peruvian anchovies, which have been hit by supply and cost issues. In Europe in particular, there has been pressure to improve the environmental impact of salmon farms. NGO criticism of water pollution, for example, has helped drive better feed efficiency. “The more efficient the feed, the less that is wasted as effluent,” says Hart. And public concerns about palm oil and deforestation prompted Ewos to pledge to remove palm oil products from its fish feed last year, although Cargill has not indicated whether it would honour this commitment. The farm fish sector also has a growing certification scheme, the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC), set up in 2010, signing up producers to minimum sustainability standards.  Of course, as critics have pointed out, the focus on efficiency and feed is a very narrow definition of sustainability. It ignores the ethics of rearing caged fish or chickens and issues such as stocking densities, use of chemicals or antibiotics, husbandry and disease control. The results may be a more sustainable meat for consumers, but not necessarily a more ethical one. For Hart, however, the benefits cannot be ignored. “We’re heading towards a crisis and because of the type of livestock production we are doing at present, food is one of the biggest problem areas. It’s mostly to do with feed, so anything that helps us use less feed is important,” he says.",2015-09-01T12:38:03Z,"Farmed fish could bring us cheaper food, but is it ethical?","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""5a9464cbc1abc0d37073ee2d96d6ebbf2950c09f""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/25/1440512562703/f894d310-71dc-4a14-88a9-ba2d08bd49cf-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Salmon farms are some of the most efficient convertors of feed across the animal protein sector."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Salmon farms are some of the most efficient convertors of feed across the animal protein sector.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: David Cheskin/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>",22,US food company Cargill wants to use expertise from the farmed salmon sector to help it produce more efficient and sustainable fish and chicken,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/25/1440512563199/f894d310-71dc-4a14-88a9-ba2d08bd49cf-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/sep/01/farmed-fish-could-bring-us-cheaper-food-but-is-it-ethical,6,positive
"My first memory, at three or four, is of a huge old sow falling from a trailer in front of us on a Pembrokeshire lane and my mother bursting into the folk song Mochyn Du [Black Pig] – “Oh how tasty a bit of pig meat, with potato as a rare treat”. When they lived in Sheffield, before I was born, my parents’ neighbours were Gujaratis who taught Mum to make proper curries. They remain my favourite meals, preferably with smoky Indian wines full of lovely delicate tastes. I remember Mum preparing her masala dal mix in her coffee grinder. At five, after discovering how a piece of a plant will grow roots when placed in water, I tried to grow a chicken foot using the same method and hid it behind the shaving foams in the bathroom cupboard. My parents discovered this after sourcing the atrocious smell. Later I ate a Chinese chicken foot dumpling during a stopover in Tuvalu [in the Pacific] and didn’t enjoy it. I associate church with rhubarb. The Tabernacle Baptist church in Cardiff is where I went as a child – twice on Sundays – to sing hymns, and where family are buried. The cemetery was allowed to grow quite wild and it had rhubarb which I’d eat during recess. I should watch what I say, having schoolchildren of my own now, but I never liked school food and unknown to my parents I survived on Mars bars. As a student nurse in London, at 18, I practised giving injections to oranges. But of course people have bones. I was living in a nurses’ home and making one-pot-wonder soups to the soundtrack of Play That Funky Music on a one-ring electric hob I’d bought from Argos. I’m blowing my own trumpet but my soups are delicious. Although sometimes, when I’m programming a radio show, I’ll be cooking a soup at the same time and forget until it’s almost burnt dry. I dislike waste, so I’ll try to scoop the remains from the smoky pan into a clean one and hope the children don’t say anything I’ve spent a lot of time, as a parent of messy young children, on my hands and knees getting food off my favourite records. I make them, say, pasta and broccoli and then discover it on my music collection and think, “Oh man, the fingerprints.” I’ll tell you what’s best for teething children – chucking them a lamb chop. Just before I left [the band] Catatonia in the late 90s, I lost my appetite. It was the end of a chapter and things had to change and I just wasn’t happy, basically. Now I’ve got a wonderful life and incredible job and family – so there’s people to cook for. I’m enjoying food more than ever before. OFM My rider as a performer is fresh chillies, good cheeses, great brown granary bread, nuts and fruit, and maybe honey. It’s really basic, because I think as soon as you get too fancy you’re into the wrong side of rock n roll. One thing I won’t stand for is Doritos. When you’re a musician and especially in the provinces, Doritos always sneak into your dressing room, so I’m often heard shouting “Get those Doritos out of here”. They’re disgusting. Food hell is also cheesy Wotsits. It’s the same with anything cheesy or cheesy saucy. Either give me cheese or no cheesiness at all.

"Cereal for dinner is comfort food. It’s a go-to for college students, anyone in the midst of a Netflix binge, and it’s a savior on days when it’s too cold to bother going to the store. It’s the easiest meal to make: just add milk. And yet this standard snack has somehow become New York’s latest food trend. Kith Treats, the newly opened “cereal bar” in Brooklyn, is a spartan, all-white dessert cafe stuck on to the front of the high-end athletic wear and shoe store, Kith. The hip streetwear shop features a glass cabinet of sneakers atop tennis balls, and sells its own apparel line, Kith, alongside brands like Timberland, Nike and Asics. Kith Treats presents its cereal with the same attention to detail as it does its shoes: with plenty of design flourishes. Cocoa Puffs and Frosted Flakes are sold in little silver packets. They come packaged in a shoebox, with a glass bottle of milk, that you can eat out of with a special spoon-cum-straw. Kith Treats is the pet project of a cereal enthusiast. Ronnie Fieg, founder of Kith clothing, said he wanted to open a cereal bar because he just loves cereal. “When I was a kid, my parents wouldn’t allow me to eat sugary cereals,” Fieg says, “I would sneak to friends’ houses to have it.” But as a first-time visitor, I couldn’t immediately work out the appeal of eating such a basic food in such swish surroundings, so I took the cereal home and ate it later that evening in my pyjamas on the couch.     Kith’s cereal wall showcases the options available. Photograph: The Guardian    Kith has two locations, the one in Brooklyn with the attached cereal bar, and another in Manhattan. The Brooklyn location reopened on Tuesday after a $2m renovation.  The white-tiled shopfront sells its breakfast staples between 7am and 8pm on weekdays and til 10pm on weekends.  The menu at Kith has all the classics: Corn Flakes, Cheerios, Fruit Loops and Lucky Charms. Customers have a choice of five milks (whole, skim, hemp, almond, chocolate) and 24 toppings (including marshmallows, coconut flakes and crushed Oreos).  Patrons can make their own box for $6 and choose up to two cereals ($7 for three) and one of the milk options – toppings are an additional 75 cents each. Customers can also try one of the Kith Treats combination specials, named after musicians, artists and pro BMX riders. I got the Bam Bam to go, which was designed by the rapper Action Bronson. And by designed, I mean the combination of Rice Krispies Treats, Cookie Crisp, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Kit Kat, Oreo and Marshmallow Charms was dreamed up and priced at $9.25. I also tried the Cereal Swirl, which is ice cream with crushed-up Lucky Charms and marshmallows in it ($5.50). It was delicious, like a grownup McFlurry. The barista (cerealista?) tells me a lot of the people who come in later in the day opt for the ice cream over the cereal. Considering Milk Bar, the destination dessert store which is part of the Momofuku family, charges $6.25 for three cookies, and cronut from the Dominique Ansel Bakery will set you back $5, Kith Treats’ pricing isn’t astronomical. Granted it’s a lot more money than buying the cereal in the supermarket, but the same is true for most takeout options.   Related: Revealed: the official Cronut recipe (and why you will never make one)    “We found out about [the restaurant] on Instagram,” said Shanea Washington, who was eating at Kith with her girlfriend Shayna Williams on Thursday evening. “I don’t really like cereal,” Williams said, “but I like it when it comes in a shoebox.” Both Washington and Williams are fans of the Kith brand and were keen to come check out the fuss over its cereal bar. “I love the straw spoon,” Washington said, adding that she’d probably keep the shoebox after she finished eating her meal of cereal and crushed Oreos. Even though the store has been open for less than a week, some people are, apparently, already hooked. During my visit, a man in a suit was awarded a prize for having made four purchases at Kith Treats in seven days. He’d already been in the store that morning buying cereal for his girlfriend and came back for more supplies for the next day. It seems Kith Treats’ tactic to get people coming back by offering a loyalty card is working a treat.",2015-08-29T12:30:15Z,Cereal out of a shoebox: New York's latest food trend,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""5206adce4c08b65b807f04e691dbf13cd0166039""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/5206adce4c08b65b807f04e691dbf13cd0166039/0_77_4663_2798/1000.jpg"" alt=""cereal shoebox kith treats"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">‘I don’t really like cereal but I like it when it comes in a shoebox’ – the genius of marketing.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>",24,A fashion retailer in – where else? – Brooklyn is turning the classic student staple of all-day cereal into a moneyspinner at a minimum $6 a pop,http://media.guim.co.uk/5206adce4c08b65b807f04e691dbf13cd0166039/0_77_4663_2798/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/29/cereal-shoebox-new-york-latest-food-trend,5,positive
"Recently the American website Ecowatch published an intriguing piece contrasting the fortunes of McDonald’s, criticised for not taking sustainability seriously enough and losing business, with Shake Shack, the fast-expanding cult burger chain with a more ethical approach. The reversal of those fortunes, it seems, is down to millennials, the generation born between 1982 and 2000, who are determined to spend their money in a way that does the planet less harm. This was backed up by the business magazine Forbes which declared that the highly developed social conscience of millennials would be a major driver of food sales for years to come. Even Monsanto has appointed a “director of millennial engagement”. Cheering, isn’t it? Young people seem to give a damn, especially about their lunch. But wait. Another report about the same age group suggests a good number don’t apply the ethics test to all their purchases. According to a Europe-wide study of drug habits, while marijuana use is in decline, it’s still the favoured drug of more than 12% of Britons aged 15-34. And coke is still used by more than 5% of twentysomethings. Anecdotally, those numbers get much higher in moneyed urban areas. The problem is that unless you’re buying from some hydroponics whizz working from a nearby attic, finding a local supply of grass is tough. And as yet no one has slapped a Fairtrade mark on cocaine. We appear to have a disconnect, albeit an understandable one. Buying ethically produced food, and making a statement about yourself by doing so, is now so easy it requires little or no thought. Thinking about where your narcotics come from, on the other hand, is so difficult it’s simply easier not to do so. Not that this is news to anybody who has floated around a street food festival recently. Along with the smell of Fairtrade coffee and locally reared pork how often have we sniffed the high tang of grass? In my case, regularly. We are, it seems, living in the age of the wonky moral compass: of middle-class couples who swear by their weekly organic veg box, and yet relax after dinner with a line of something produced by impoverished, subjugated Bolivian peasants. It’s the age of urban hipsters who Instagram their dinner until it’s begging for mercy, and finish their tweets with the hashtag #eatclean, but for whom a night out would be a failure if it hadn’t involved the contents of a plastic money bag. The novelist Don Winslow, chronicler of the west’s failed war on the Mexican drug cartels, put it best in an interview with Men’s Journal. “Twentysomethings now?” he bellowed. “God forbid they should buy anything but Fairtrade coffee, or locally grown pork... And yet they’ll think nothing of buying marijuana that has blood all over it – Central Americans kidnapped, made into slave labour, raped, murdered... It pisses me off beyond belief.” Me too, Don. Look, I’m not criticising other peoples’ lifestyle choices. And I’m hardly clean-handed. Until university and a bad mushroom trip, I did all the drugs, though I did try to avoid making false claims about my virtue. (In truth I revelled in my badness.) And of course, the majority of people who support Fairtrade or local are not off their gourd every Friday evening. I know that. But sometimes, when we’re being assailed with hipster rhetoric about healthy, ethical eating, perhaps we should remember that a Fairtrade flat white at £2.50 a cup is also a bloody cheap way by which to make a few false statements about yourself.",2015-08-19T10:59:03Z,Don’t bang on to me about ethical food if you still keep a stash of very unfairly traded weed,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""2e596b6e742eb69374047b719e1574be6c9349eb""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/13/1439479028843/b6f6cc31-2008-4cd3-b62e-44d5e7fecf43-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Cup of coffee with a fancy pattern in the foam"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">‘God forbid twenty-somethings should buy anything but Fairtrade coffee’</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>",25,Millennials and urban hipsters love the hashtag #eatclean – but do they apply the same standards to their grass and coke?,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/13/1439479029178/b6f6cc31-2008-4cd3-b62e-44d5e7fecf43-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/19/dont-bang-on-to-me-about-ethical-food-if-you-still-keep-a-stash-of-very-unfairly-traded-weed,2,neutral
"The development of a greener, less wasteful health service is one of the cornerstones of the NHS’s improvement plan. Sonia Roschnik, head of the Sustainable Development Unit, which supports NHS, public health and social care services in England, says sustainability is a key part of the Five Year Forward View – the blueprint for the future of the health service – not just because it makes financial sense but because it is a health matter. “Sustainability is important for the NHS because climate change and the environment are going to impact on people’s health – whether that is air pollution leading to respiratory disease, or not eating good nutritious food,” she says. “There are a lot of links between high consumerism, unsustainable behaviours and impacts on health.”     apetito is committed to reducing its environmental impact. Illustration: theguardian.com    The NHS’s long-term strategy also requires adapting to climate change. “We already know the consequences of hot summers on wards,” adds Roschnik, “so we need to be better prepared for it.” Crucially, reducing the health service’s environmental impact goes beyond improving energy efficiency within its buildings or minimising the carbon footprint from transport. The NHS also needs to look at the procurement of vital services, such as food and medical supplies. One business already taking steps to help the NHS become a more sustainable health service is apetito. The catering company, which supplies food and services to more than 400 hospitals in the UK, is committed to reducing its environmental impact. Measures the business has already taken include only buying fish certified by the Marine Conservation Society and using sustainable palm oil. The company is also striving to reduce the amount of energy used at factory level, using solar energy to reduce its carbon emissions by 40% since 2007. The amount of food waste sent to landfill has been reduced to zero thanks to the business’s investment in an anaerobic digestion system, which converts the material into electricity. This green power now accounts for 5% of energy used in the factory. The diesel consumption of the company’s fleet of delivery vehicles has also been reduced by a third. apetito is conscious, however, that sustainability is not just about the environment – it’s about economic and social issues as well. That’s why the business currently pays 82% of its staff at least the national living wage and by next year says that will rise to 100%.     Musgrove Park’s progress on reducing food waste. Photograph: theguardian.com    Importantly, because all the meals are frozen, hospitals are able to make significant food waste savings. One of apetito’s clients, Musgrove Park hospital in Taunton, Somerset, reduced food waste from 21% to 5% after switching to cook-freeze meals. Feedback from patients has been overwhelmingly positive and the hospital scooped the Hospital Catering Association’s catering service of the year award earlier this year. Lee Sheppard, director of public policy and external affairs for apetito, says the company made the decision to focus more on sustainability eight years ago after a report from sector body the Food and Drink Federation revealed the company was sending more waste to landfill than previously thought. Sheppard says: “That was definitely a defining moment where we said, what are we going to do about this? What is the right sustainability model for us and that supports our customers? Where do we want to be and where do we need to be? What are the things that we need to start working on?”  Despite radically reducing waste and improving efficiency across the company’s operations, apetito is determined to build on its achievements and is creating a roadmap to help it meet sustainability objectives by the year 2020.  “We have had a lot of success around driving improvements around energy and waste, but what we now want to do is make sure that roadmap is embedded within our company values,” adds Sheppard. “We are looking at major factory development at the moment and the sustainability factors will be built in to every purchase decision we make there.”     Companies such as apetito are helping the NHS deliver a more sustainable health service. Photograph: theguardian.com    Companies such as apetito are helping the NHS deliver a more sustainable health service and the priority now is educating the sector about what sustainability really means and how this approach can benefit patient care. Scott Buckler, business development director for social enterprise 4AllofUs, organiser of the NHS Sustainability Day, says an increasing number of NHS trusts are becoming engaged in this agenda. He thanks the Five Year Forward View, which touches on prevention and sustainability, as a key driver for this change. Roschnik agrees that there is a growing appetite for sustainability in the NHS and would like it to be seen as just part and parcel of the way the health service is run. “It should become so natural that actually we don’t need to think about it,” she says. “That will take years and years to take effect but in a way it would be great if people could see that it is not so much of a challenge but more of a great opportunity because we can not only save money but improve health and save the environment.” Content on this page is paid for and produced to a brief agreed by apetito",2015-08-18T11:30:44Z,Why hospital catering company is focusing on sustainability,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""56a5c25f281dedd955a58d63274315b21b97b889""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/11/1439295994861/d940de35-db45-4456-b1d2-7b5a8d3d703b-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Solar panels"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption""><em>apetito </em>has cut its carbon emissions by 40% since 2007 by using solar energy.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Terry Mathews /Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>",26,"For <em>apetito</em>, sustainability isn’t just about environmental initiatives, it includes economic and social issues too<br>",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/11/1439295995207/d940de35-db45-4456-b1d2-7b5a8d3d703b-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/apetito-hospital-food-nutrition/2015/aug/18/why-hospital-catering-company-is-focusing-on-sustainability,0,positive
"Australia is a nation divided over tipping. In the US the rule is to add 15% to 20% to the bill. In the UK many restaurants add a 12.5% service charge – and if not, people normally tip about 10% unless the service was bad. Here in Australia the rules are there are no rules.  My sources in Australia’s upper-tier restaurants anecdotally report that more than half of customers tip. But what about in cafes or less high-end restaurants? Or for takeaway food? The most operators at the lower end of the spectrum can expect is pocket change or the bill rounded up a couple of dollars.   Related: Top tips on tipping around the world    The introduction of PayWave last year, where any transaction under $100 can be paid at an electronic remove, has accounted for a drop in tips across the board.  “I’d say the industry has definitely been affected,” says a restaurant veteran, John Kanis from the Lucas Group (Chin Chin, Kong and Baby, all in Melbourne). “Our staff had a big hit when it was first introduced, then as people got used to it the situation stablilised. I’d say tips are running at between 5% and 10% lower than before.  “But I go to places all the time that don’t even prompt you for a tip. They haven’t gotten over that hump, and I have to ask how to leave a tip. They’d be taking a much bigger hit.” So why tip? Is it the proper way to say thanks for a great time, polite acknowledgment of a difficult job, or simply because it’s a noble tradition? Jess Ho, the branding expert on Channel Seven’s Restaurant Revolution and owner of the South Melbourne wine bar Smalls, sees tipping as a weekly bonus rather than the raison d’être of the job. “I don’t do it for tips. I do it for hospitality,” she says. “But instead of a bonus a lot of people see it as a supplement to their wage. Either way you look at it, it encourages professionalism.” And what of tipping etiquette? Example: do you tip for takeaway? Answer: only if the waiter performed a magnificent feat, such as bagging the food in an aerodynamically-designed aluminium foil swan.  Or: should you tip bad service? Answer: no. Definitely not. That would make a mockery of the whole system. Tipping is for good service, although inveterate tippers would argue it’s for “good enough” service. While in the US tipping in the order of 15% to 20% is standard, the rough rule of thumb in Australia is 10%, although 5% will probably do in a cafe.  Can you tip individual waiters? Well, yes, you can choose to slip your server $20 at the end of the night and he or she can choose to pocket it, but restaurant etiquette generally demands it goes into the communal tip pool. Can you be sure it’s going to the waitstaff? Unfortunately you can’t, even though owners pocketing tips is illegal. It’s a game of trust, ruined in the breach by a minority. Do note, though, that the odds of your tip making it to the right people increase by leaving cash rather than a credit card gratuity. Furthermore, if you ever find a gratuity is included on the bill, you can refuse to pay it. You really needn’t tip on top of it unless service was so good it would have made angels weep.  So who tips in Australia? Ho says students “tend to either tip massively or not at all”. Tourists: “Yes, definitely.” Young families: no. The affluent – or at least those spending big – tend to be hit and miss. “If they go out of their way to say it was a really great night you know they won’t tip. I think it’s a way of overcompensating.” According to Kanis: “The bottom line is, you never can tell who’s going to tip and who isn’t.” He reckons it’s a good thing, too: “Restaurants are meant to be democratic places. If you could profile people it really wouldn’t be good for the industry.”  • Larissa Dubecki is a freelance food writer and restaurant critic.

"There’s only so much roasting and stewing you can do in the cold months before you want something that reminds you of summer. Fried chicken is the ultimate crossover food, equally at home topping a spicy winter laksa as it is next to summer coleslaw.  It’s also having something of a moment, with new hipster fried chicken joints opening with the same frequency that we saw in 2013 with the Mexican food revolution.    Malaysians and Indonesians love their chicken marinated in spices like turmeric and fried with pandan leaves    Nearly every culture has its own version of the dirty bird. Malaysians and Indonesians love their chicken marinated in spices like turmeric and fried with pandan leaves, which give it a unique herbal twang.  Americans brine then dredge their chicken in flour or batter, frying it in fat before dousing it liberally with hot sauce, gravy or cayenne pepper (more on that below).  Taiwanese enjoy fried chickens flat and large, while the Japanese take a more delicate hand with punchy karaage, schnitzel-like katsu and tempura styles.  Traditional crisp-skinned chicken from southern China juxtaposes soft tender flesh with a deeply tanned and lacquered visage, making it equally at home in a lunchbox or a lavish wedding feast. Then in Korea, perhaps the only celebrated legacy of the Korean war is its twice-fried Korean fried chicken, everyone’s friend after a drunken night. But it’s in the southern United States where fried chicken found its place in popular culture. The idea of frying chicken is said to have really caught on with Scottish immigrants who, as the story goes, consider frying to be almost a national sport. Chicken, like the Mars Bar decades later, worked well when cooked in hot lard, and so it rapidly became a staple in the new colonies where slaves from Africa added their own spin to it with their own seasonings and techniques.  Where the Brits might have boiled or baked their bird, it became the norm to fry it in the US, such that regional styles evolved dictating everything from sauces served alongside to batters, bastes and marinades. Then, in 1930, a former insurance salesman started serving his own version of fried chicken in a rent-free service station in Corbin, Kentucky. Pressure-fried to cook quickly, KFC’s 11 secret herb and spice-dusted chicken hit Australian shores in 1968 and is still going strong. KFC aside, where are the best new places in Australia to buy fried chicken? MelbourneBelle’s Hot Chicken in Fitzroy has to be the hottest place, literally, for the dirty bird right now. Their brined and flour-dusted chicken is fried in a secret blend of fats then doused with paprika and cayenne pepper at levels which range from mild to “really f**kin’ hot” in the style chef Morgan McGlone learned to cook in Nashville, where fried chicken is almost a religion. They’re planning another branch in Richmond, which should help ease the queues at mealtimes. CBD-based Gami Fried Chicken serves up crisp and zingy Korean-style bird. You’ll need to order ahead for Collingwood’s Rockwell &amp; Sons’ slow-brined fried chicken, which gets an extra coating of buttermilk and hot sauce when its served only on Wednesday nights. SydneySydney’s current buzz for fried chicken has been fuelled by the publication of Fried Chicken &amp; Friends, the debut cookbook from chefs Gregeory Llewellyn and Naomi Hart from Newtown’s Hartsyard (Murdoch Books, $49.95, Hardback). Here, the bird is brined then dipped in buttermilk – twice – before being fried and served with sausage gravy and lashings of their hot sauce. A sophisticated take on Korean fried chicken can be found at Redfern’s Moon Park, where buttermilk is blended with Malaysian shrimp sauce for a salt and umami-fuelled crunch.  Potts Point’s Ms.G’s takes their inspiration from Thailand, steeping their bird in curry paste before frying to a golden crunch.  Queues are the norm for Taiwanese-style fried chicken vendor Hot Star, who squish their chicken flat before crumbing, frying and then liberally dousing it with their signature spicy salt that manages to be both sweet and savoury at once. There’s eight locations – four in Sydney – with two in Melbourne plus one each in Adelaide and Sunnybank, Brisbane.

"The challenges of the 21st century will stretch our collective capacity for innovation like never before.Take food security. Our mission, should we choose to accept it, is first to find 175-220m hectares of additional cropland by 2030; second, to increase total food production by about 70% by 2050, mostly through improving crop yields; and third, to achieve all this without damaging the land, poisoning ourselves or impairing the health of our finite and already fragile ecosystems.The Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) estimates that meeting this challenge will require investment in developing countries' agriculture of $9.2tn (£5.4tn) over the next 44 years – about $210bn (£123bn) a year (PDF) – from both private and public sources. Just under half of this amount will need to go into primary agriculture, and the rest into food processing, transportation, storage and other downstream activities. A priority will be finding ways to close the gaps between crop yields in developed and developing countries, which are around 40%, 75%, and 30-200% less in developing countries for wheat, rice and maize, respectively (PDF) – all while using fewer resources and less harmful substances.This challenge is hard enough, but we also have to tackle the problem of 1.3bn tonnes of food wasted every year (PDF) – roughly a third of all food produced for human consumption. Fortunately, this is an area where technology can play a strong role, and where the economic, human and environmental benefits are compelling. An assessment of resource productivity opportunities between now and 2030 suggests that reducing food waste could return $252bn (£148bn) in savings, the third largest of all  resource efficiency opportunities identified by a McKinsey study.Reducing food waste through improved packagingAlthough food waste is highest in Europe and North America (PDF), it is also a problem in developing regions like sub-Saharan Africa and south and south-east Asia.According to the FAO, the total value of lost food is $4bn per year in Africa and $4.5bn a year in India, with up to 50% of fruit and vegetables ending up as waste. In developing countries including China and Vietnam, most food is lost through poor handling, storage and spoilage in distribution. It is estimated that 45% of rice in China and 80% in Vietnam (PDF) never make it to market for these reasons.One of the most effective ways to reduce food waste is to improve packaging, for example by using Modified Atmosphere Packaging (Map) – a technology that substitutes the atmosphere inside a package with a protective gas mix, typically a combination of oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen – to extend freshness.This is a well-proven solution that calls for technology transfer rather than invention, which has been the approach of the Sustainable Product Innovation Project in Vietnam. Through the project, Map has been applied to over 1,000 small-scale farmers, resulting in reductions in post-harvest food waste from 30-40% to 15-20%.Another simple packaging solution being promoted in developing countries is the International Rice Research Institute Super Bag. When properly sealed, the bag cuts oxygen levels from 21% to 5%, reducing live insects to fewer than one insect per kg of grain without using insecticides – often within 10 days of sealing. This extends the germination life of seeds from 6 to 12 months and controls insect grain pests (without using chemicals).Improved storage and transportationBesides improved packaging, a second way to reduce food loss and waste is through improved storage and transportation. A new report on creating a sustainable ""cold chain"" in the developing world estimates that about 25-50% of food wastage (PDF)  could be eliminated with better, more climate friendly refrigeration. For example, Unilever has committed to using  hydrocarbon (HC) refrigerants, which saved 40,000 tonnes of CO2 in 2013.Waste into energyFinally, even when food waste cannot be eliminated, its impacts can still be reduced, or even converted into benefits. For instance, animal by-products from slaughterhouses that are usually incinerated or disposed of in landfills can be treated by a new technology called the APRE process (PDF), which can treat 11 tonnes of dead animals every day, producing 4,000 metres cubed of bio-gas (60% of which is methane) and 44 tonnes of liquid fertiliser. The heat generated can be turned into electricity to be used in production or sold on.As we can see, many technological solutions to agri-food waste already exist and only need to be more effectively shared and affordably adapted to local contexts. However, as always, technology is only part of the answer – something that Paris retailer Intermarché creatively, humorously and profitably demonstrates with its recent Inglorious Fruits and Vegetables campaign, which discounts and celebrates fresh food that does not comply with EU size and colour restrictions and would otherwise have been dumped.The sustainability revolution is as much about changing perceptions, attitudes and behaviours – the software – as about changing the technology.Wayne Visser is director of Kaleidoscope Futures and a senior associate at the University of Cambridge.

"He has pioneered savoury ice-cream, encouraged his diners to wear headphones while eating and even developed recipes for astronauts. Now Heston Blumenthal, renowned chef of the three Michelin-starred Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire, is taking on his biggest challenge yet: redefining the very nature of the restaurant. As he reveals in an exclusive interview in Observer Food Monthly, when the Fat Duck reopens at the end of September after a six-month relocation to Australia while the original was being refurbished, it won’t simply be a place for dinner; it will be a “story”. “In the sense that we cook food and it’s served to people, we’re a restaurant. But that’s not much, is it?” says Blumenthal. “The fact is the Fat Duck is about storytelling. I wanted to think about the whole approach of what we do in those terms.”   Related: Heston Blumenthal interview: the Fat Duck flies again    As part of the process Blumenthal, who is famed for the whimsy of savoury ice-lollies mimicking the look of children’s favourites and for fish dishes eaten to a seashore soundtrack, has enlisted the help of a creative team including Billy Elliot writer Lee Hall. “He looked at the menu and said that, with the ice-lollies and the sounds of the sea, this is basically a holiday. It’s about those childhood feelings of adventure, discovery and curiosity,” said Blumenthal. What does this mean for diners? “It means the menu will now be a story. It will have an introduction and a number of chapters and chapter headings that will give you an idea of what is coming.” Blumenthal describes it as the story of his own childhood holidays in Cornwall. While a few of his best known dishes will remain on the menu others, including snail porridge and egg and bacon ice-cream, are coming off. “They had evolved as far as they could. We may put them in a hall of fame.” Blumenthal, 49, has long been fascinated by nostalgia for childhood and has often used the phrase “like a kid in a sweetshop” to describe how he wants diners to feel. Now, he says, he has built his sweetshop, at a cost of more than £150,000. “It’s an automaton, in the shape of a doll’s house that will come round on a trolley at the end of the meal and puff smoke rings out the chimney as you choose your sweets.” Those choices will be personalised, as he hopes will other parts of the meal. Much has been made of high-end restaurants googling their guests in advance; Blumenthal says they’ve been doing that at the Duck for years. Now they want to take it further and have turned to the magician Derren Brown for advice. “I talked to him about how we could find out things about people without them being too aware.” As a result, he is toying with using auto-suggestion techniques so that diners get what they think they most crave. He has also consulted psychologists, font experts and artists. Blumenthal recognises that he could be accused of grossly overthinking dinner and lurching into pretentiousness. “If people want to think that, it’s their choice. You can’t please everybody all the time.” But he adds that nothing will be served “unless it’s delicious”. In any case, it won’t be open to everybody because none of this will come cheap. When the Fat Duck closed at the start of the year, the multi-course tasting menu cost £220 a head without drinks or service, but Blumenthal acknowledges that the price will have to go up. “You’re getting something that’s handmade, and there are more than 70 staff for 40 seats at each service. We won’t be making vast amounts of money on this.” Not that he thinks there will be a shortage of demand. “We were getting 30,000 calls a day for seats, so we’re replacing the phone lines with an online ticketing system.” Although not all details have been finalised, this may include the kind of lottery system used during the Fat Duck’s move to Australia. He answers accusations of elitism by pointing to the large range of products he makes for Waitrose, including ready meals, desserts and spirits. “Exactly the same amount of work goes into those products, which means an element of the Duck is open to everybody.” Still, those wanting to be told Heston Blumenthal’s full story will just have to save up.",2015-08-23T07:00:18Z,It’s goodbye to snail porridge as Heston Blumenthal bids to reinvent the restaurant again,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""f3207cecd435deb8f6d1494054fd097b96f36598""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/21/1440180056218/36c56cc3-0c78-4d2e-b462-e9a4def9b160-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Heston Blumenthal: 'We were getting 30,000 calls a day for seats.'"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Heston Blumenthal: ‘We were getting 30,000 calls a day for seats.’</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Matt LLoyd/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>",30,The award-winning Fat Duck is reopening and its chef says that it won’t just be a place for dinner – it will be about storytelling,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/21/1440180056612/36c56cc3-0c78-4d2e-b462-e9a4def9b160-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/23/goodbye-snail-porridge-heston-blumenthal-fat-duck-new-chapter-in-food,8,positive
"Halal certification enables up to $13bn in food exports each year, according to Australia’s peak body for food and drink manufacturers, which has criticised the “abusive anti-halal calls and mail” directed at its members by opponents of the certification scheme. The Australian Food and Grocery Council (AFGC) also questioned claims that halal certification represents a “tax” on business, arguing the religious approval “creates more value than it costs”, in a submission to a Senate inquiry on third-party food certification.   Related: Senator Cory Bernardi wins inquiry into halal and kosher certifications    More than 700 submissions have been made to the inquiry, which was initiated by South Australian senator Cory Bernardi in May to “get to the bottom” of the halal industry, which he has previously described as a “racket”. Among the concerns raised in the submissions is that halal certification is “forced on” retailers; funds terrorism; and is “purely a scam of gigantic proportions”. But the AFGC has defended the industry, arguing that companies pay halal certification fees because “the net effect [is] beneficial”. “Put somewhat bluntly, manufacturers will only pay a dollar for a certification if they expect to get more than a dollar back in sales, whether directly or indirectly,” the AFGC said.  “If they pay a dollar and only get 80c worth of value, they will drop the certification.”   Related: Barnaby Joyce defends halal after Coalition MPs express concern    A survey of AFGC members found “no single type of certification stands out as being especially costly or hard to obtain”, according to the submission. It noted that staff at some member companies had been subject to “abusive anti-halal calls and mail” by critics of the Islamic certification.  “Such behaviour should neither be encouraged nor condoned by this inquiry,” the AFGC said. All certifiers, halal and otherwise, could provide more transparency of their processes, it noted, including of whether “the certification scheme is run not-for-profit or as a commercial venture”. The AFGC also called on Australian trade negotiators to press foreign markets to streamline their halal requirements, noting some beef exporters were having to obtain multiple halal certifications in Australia to meet different countries’ requirements. For example, Australia’s largest meat exporter, JBS Australia, spent $2.4m last year obtaining different religious approvals (but generated $3.3b in revenue). Anti-halal sentiment briefly became prominent last year and is frequently raised by some far-right and Christian parties.  A prominent anti-halal campaigner, Kirralie Smith, and the “Islam-critical” Q Society are being sued for defamation in New South Wales over their claims the Islamic certification industry is corrupt and funds “the push for Sharia law in Australia”. The Australian Crime Commission, which last year completed an investigation into money laundering in Australia, has said it is “not aware of any direct links” between the industry and violent extremist groups. The federal agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce, has warned his colleagues against “picking a fight that we never needed to have” over halal, because of the potential impact on Australian exporters. “Unless it’s halal certified, we can’t sell it. That means the whole processing line becomes unviable,” Joyce, the deputy leader of the Nationals, said in April. “If we didn’t have the halal market in beef, that could really affect thousands of meat workers in Australia.” Tony Abbott has also defended the industry, arguing it is “just part of exporting to the Middle East, and if we want our exports to grow all the time, this is what we need to do, and I think that’s what Australians want”.",2015-08-14T05:00:18Z,"Halal certification 'creates more value than it costs', says peak food body","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""0a2851ff86c9461979ddae970e14cb3b0080e244""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/0a2851ff86c9461979ddae970e14cb3b0080e244/0_0_4896_2939/1000.jpg"" alt=""South Australian senator Cory Bernardi"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">South Australian senator Cory Bernardi initiated a Senate inquiry in May to ‘get to the bottom’ of the halal industry.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Stefan Postles/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>",31,Australian Food and Grocery Council criticises ‘abusive anti-halal calls and mail’ directed at its members by opponents of the scheme,http://media.guim.co.uk/0a2851ff86c9461979ddae970e14cb3b0080e244/0_0_4896_2939/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/aug/14/halal-certification-creates-more-value-than-it-costs-says-peak-food-body,4,negative
"Blood oranges have crimson, sometimes almost black-red flesh.  Australian varieties are grown for their pigment, with farmers choosing the reddest ones. They are a winter fruit, available at the outset of the season in late July, and extending to October or even November if conditions are right. At the market, choose a blood orange as you would an orange: you want one that is firm and heavy with juice.  Native to Sicily, the blood orange grows at its best in a Mediterranean climate, loving hot days and almost freezing nights, much like grape vines. This extreme variability in temperature helps produce the red of the blood orange.     Blood oranges are a winter fruit and are available until November.  Photograph: Lauren Bamford for the Guardian    In the kitchen, substitute blood orange where you would normally use the zest of a regular orange, lime or lemon. Make blood orange curd. Use in a winter salad of blood orange, radicchio, fennel and mint.  At the end of winter, when we’re often sick of soups and stews, and not eating as many raw vegetables as we would in summer, it’s refreshing to crunch into fennel, bitter radicchio and the tart blood orange.  Juice blood oranges first thing in the morning to ward away a cold, and make sure you freeze some juice for summer cocktails.  This rice pudding is zesty and creamy, sure to comfort on the last of these cold nights. The base of the recipe is adapted from the Edmonds Sure to Rise cookbook, which is a New Zealand classic and was first published in 1908 as a way to sell baking powder. It’s a very old fashioned cookbook. The process of cooking rice pudding doesn’t vary much, but the flavours added to the creamy rice can be played with.  You could use saffron, or anise, or ground ginger, cinnamon, raisins or lemon peel –though not all at once. Here we’ve simply used cardamom with the pistachios and pine nuts to top. There’s not much sugar in the pudding itself, so drizzle with a little agave to serve. You can up the sugar in the recipe if you’d like it sweeter.      If you have leftover blood orange juice, freeze for summer cocktails.

"The food bank I run is set to provide over 50,000 meals through some 41 tons of food this year, in neighbourhoods ranked among the top 10% most-deprived in England. Yet, day after day, the primary emotion of service-users visiting me is not so much hunger and thirst but shame and degradation. Man after woman, pensioner after teenager, one benefit sanction ravaged shell of humanity at a time; they never cease to astound me. Hundreds in my city are not so much craving a hand-out from the state as a lasting hand out of a great abyss of despair they have been lost to after being tripped on the cracks of a society rent in two. Community-based intervention, especially for those suffering the disadvantages of food poverty, mental illness and any number of other financial, familial and compulsive battles, is of paramount importance. But why should this financial and material burden fall on another minority – the one that donates with a generosity capable of reducing my team to tears? I suppose I should consider a paternal hand from government as being far too much to ask; for if sea rescue were also to depend on the public coffers, these poor souls could just as easily expect to drown. It is almost fashionable these days to condemn the benefit claimant as contributing nothing to society, but why will government not help us address the determinants of personal crises – and particularly mental-illness-related poverties – once and for all, moving beyond the provision of short-term solutions to those most desperate for change?

"I'm sure you were thinking the same thing I was when Lady Gaga made her appearance at the 2010 MTV Music Video Awards – beautiful dress, but how is she going to store it? Nanotechnology could have a solution for Gaga's biodegradable wardrobe, and could also answer some other, more pressing questions about how food can be safely stored.According to a 2013 report from the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, 30-50% of food is lost to spoilage before it is eaten. In developed nations, most of the waste comes from two sources: consumers who buy too much and let it rot in their fridges, and farmers, who leave less-than-beautiful food to rot in their fields.In the developing world, consumers are less picky about the appearance of their food, and are less likely to let it rot in their homes. But inadequate storage means that up to half of the food that gets harvested spoils before it gets to the market. Ghana, for example, loses up to half of its maize crop to spoilage. Consumers in the developed world have been understandably wary of nanotechnology products in their food, but nanoparticles can be used in food packaging in a number of ways to prevent food from spoiling. That could change the amount of useable food for billions of people.NanoclayThe most widely used nanomaterial in food packaging today is nanoclay. Small plate-shaped particles of clay, 1nm thick and 1,000nm in diameter, are embedded into the plastics normally used for packaging, such as polypropylene and polyethylene. The biggest problem with standard plastics is that air and other small molecules, such as water vapour, can get through them. When nanoclay particles are embedded in plastics, the air has to go around these multiple layers of clay plates in order to get through the plastic; this takes time and reduces the amount that gets through. Nanoclay-embedded plastics allow less air and water vapour to pass, which means drinks stay fizzier and grains stay drier.Interestingly, nanoclay was first embedded in another material by Toyota, in the company's search to find stronger and more fire-resistant materials. Nanoclay-embedded plastics are also up to 100 times stronger than regular plastics, and only a few percent heavier. Furthermore, if polylactic acid (one of the biodegradable plastics used for food packaging) is embedded with nanoclay, it biodegrades even faster.Hi ho silverSilver has a long history as an antimicrobial, and is toxic to bacteria, fungi, algae, and possibly some viruses. Hippocrates sprinkled it on wounds to help them heal. Today, silver is still used in wound dressings, and was the sterilisation agent for water on the Mir space station and on Nasa shuttles. Embedding silver nanoparticles in food packaging could also help protect food from bacteria. Nanosilver is even more toxic to bacteria than the same amount of particulate silver, possibly because its small size allows it to act like a Trojan horse, delivering lots of silver ions to the inside of bacterial cells in a short time. Nanoclay-embedded plastics, because they prevent water vapour from coming in, can also reduce the amount of food lost to microorganisms.Is it safe?All new food packaging goes through rigorous testing in countries such as the UK. According to Barry Park, director of NanoKTN, a knowledge-based network for nanotechnologies:""Studies conducted at the Food and Environment Research Agency in the UK and reported in 2008 found no detectable migration of nanoclay from PET (a type of polyethelene plastic) and no detectable silver migration from polypropylene … on the basis of modelling, it could be predicted that any detectable migration of nanoparticles from packaging into food might take place only in the case of very small nanoparticles – of the order of 1nm – that are not bound in the polymer matrices. Otherwise, appreciable migration would be highly unlikely.""Nanotech packaging is not currently used in the UK or the rest of Europe, but is used in the US and other parts of the world. This type of packaging could be particularly useful in the developing world, where food spoilage is a major issue.

"Business name: Savvy Foods LtdBased: SheffieldWebsite: savvyspreads.com  I recall watching carob syrup, thick, black and glistening, being stirred into a waiting bowl of fresh, golden tahini. Then I tasted it and I fell in love. It was in the Turkish mountains in the early nineties and since that first, highly sensual experience, I’ve never looked back.  Fast forward to 2008 and I gave my girlfriend a jar of my own ready-made concoction based on that sacred blend and she’s hooked. Just a few more shared jars and ideas of world domination later and we’re on stage giving a talk to 200 Sheffield dignitaries (including the Lord Mayor) and receiving a prize of £2,500 for our business idea; the “elixir of spreads”. Many more days and nights of research and testing on the public at fairs, markets and cafes were to follow. It was at one of these tasting sessions we met our first investor and another came forward shortly after. Soon it was crowd-funding time. I’d been watching startups raise equity on Crowdcube for about a year. In May 2015, we were planning our wedding at the same time as our own launch. Heady times indeed. We had just 45 days to raise £50,000 and no one really believed we would do it. When we smashed the target in less than two weeks and the cash kept pouring in, no one could believe that either.

"Farming is in a “state of emergency” and a “seismic change” is needed to the way food is sold in Britain, agriculture leaders have warned after a crisis summit on falling milk prices. Leading farming unions called on the government to introduce long-term contracts between farmers, distributors and supermarkets and to force retailers to clearly label whether their products are British or imported. The emergency summit in London followed days of protests from farmers over the sharp fall in the prices they are being paid for milk. Asda and Morrisons distribution centres have been blockaded, farmers have removed cartons of milk from supermarkets and cows were paraded through the aisles of an Asda store in Stafford.   Related: Milk price row: UK farming unions hold emergency summit    Figures from AHDB Dairy, the trade body, show that the average UK farmgate price for milk – the price that farmers are paid – has fallen by 25% over the last year, to 23.66p per litre. Industry experts claim it costs farmers 30p per litre to produce milk, meaning farms have been thrown into chaos by the drop in prices. Farmers have blamed the fall in prices on a supermarket price war but retailers claim the drop reflects declining commodity prices and an oversupply of milk, partly caused by Russia’s block on western imports. Farmers For Action, the campaign group behind the milk protests, is scheduled to meet representatives from Morrisons on Tuesday to discuss the crisis. The farming unions warned of “dire consequences for the farming industry and rural economy” if the way in which food is sold does not change in the near future. The presidents of the NFU, NFU Scotland, NFU Cymru, Ulster Farmers Union and four other unions, said: “We would urge farm ministers across the UK to meet urgently. They need to admit that something has gone fundamentally wrong in the supply chain and take remedial action.  “In general, voluntary codes are not delivering their intended purpose. Government needs to take action to ensure that contracts to all farmers are longer-term and fairer in apportioning risk and reward.  “Government also needs to urgently ensure that rules are put in place regarding labelling so that it is clear and obvious which products are imported and which are British.”    Stop devaluing fresh British food like milk purely to get customers through the door  Farming unions     The trade unions said they wanted the government to push for change at the European meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 7 September. In a direct message to retailers, they added: “Stop devaluing fresh British food like milk purely to get customers through the door.” Arla, the biggest milk supplier in Britain, is to launch a new logo on its milk to show it was “responsibility sourced” from local farms. Supermarkets will have to agree to a series of conditions, including long-term contracts and a commitment to pay prices in line with the wider market, in order to sell milk with the logo. Arla is a cooperative owned by more than 13,000 farmers, including 3,000 in the UK, who are paid from the profit the group makes. Ash Amirahmadi, head of milk at Arla, warned that some farmers were being paid as little as 12p or 13p per litre and that the present situation was unsustainable. He added: “Our farmers are incredibly concerned at the moment. There is a reason why farmers are going out protesting; they are not bad people.” Amirahmadi urged retailers to make themselves “part of the solution” by signing up to the new conditions and improving the labelling of British products. “Some retailers are not far off following this already but it is not transparent,” he said. “We want to make it more transparent for our farmers.” Dairy UK, the body that oversees the country’s largest dairies and processors, which buy milk from farmers before selling it to supermarkets, said there is a global downturn in prices that is likely to worsen. Judith Bryans, chief executive of Dairy UK, whose members include Müller, Dairy Crest, and First Milk, said: “All markets are still under severe pressure and there is no denying that market conditions won’t get tougher before they get better.  “Volatility is an inherent feature of the dairy industry and we need to work as effectively and collaboratively as possible to find instruments which will help farmers in cycles of extreme volatility. But in terms of what is happening at the moment, prices will not increase until global production eases and the market is no longer over supplied. “We as an industry need to work together to weather the current storm and develop ways of helping farmers manage cyclical volatility in the future.”",2015-08-10T18:43:12Z,Farming unions call for 'seismic change' in way food is sold in Britain,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""52e8764900d4a6b7378b0ade8b74566c017b9738""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/52e8764900d4a6b7378b0ade8b74566c017b9738/0_14_5760_3457/1000.jpg"" alt=""Dairy farmer Mike Gorton, milking his cows at his farm near Macclesfield in Cheshire, is one of the many farmers across Britain being crippled by the crash in milk prices.

"Long hailed as a remedy for stress as well as skin and digestive disorders, sandalwood oil has been in demand for centuries. People in India and throughout Asia have used sandalwood powder in incense sticks and the wood itself for furniture, sacred objects and carvings. Today, its long-lasting, woody scent is used as the base for perfumes and household products. But there’s more to this everyday ingredient than meets the eye. How is sandalwood harvested? Sandalwood oil is obtained by distilling powder from the heartwood – the older, darker and more durable wood at a trunk’s center center – of fragrant trees from the santalum genus.   Related: Scent of success: perfume’s perennial popularity is thanks to natural and synthetic ingredients    Where is sandalwood grown? The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) tracks 16 species of sandalwood, broadly grouped as East Indian sandalwood, Australian sandalwood, Hawaiian sandalwood and sandalwood of the Pacific Islands. The East Indian species, frequently cited as the highest quality and the most potent, is now cultivated in Australia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Costa Rica and Cambodia.  In what ways is sandalwood used? Food products such as gelatin, candy, frozen desserts and alcoholic beverages contain sandalwood flavoring. Most Indian attars, or essential oils, contain a sandalwood base to absorb other herbal and floral notes. Sandalwood oil in capsule form is used to treat colds, fever, bronchitis, and gastric and stomach ulcers. It remains the second-most expensive wood in the world after the African blackwood. Candace Newman, owner of Oil Lady Aromatherapy, a Florida-based essential oil business, says a thumb-sized bottle of Indian sandalwood costs $90 to $100, seven times higher than 15 years ago. Why has the price of 100% sandalwood exploded? Though sandalwood plantations are being built in countries like Australia, the number of Indian plantations – on which the Indian sandalwood tree takes seven years to grow naturally and 12 to 15 years to cultivate commercially – has decreased. The International Union for Conservation of Nature, a global environmental organization, includes red sandalwood on its Red List of Threatened Species. How is the market meeting demand in the face of declining amounts of sandalwood oil? Numerous synthetic sandalwood substitutes are available. One, Sandalore, promises the same benefits as the increasingly rare oil. New Scientist reported in 2014 that researchers at Hanns Hatt’s lab at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany, found Sandalore, often used in perfumes and skin care products, would bind to an olfactory receptor in skin called OR2AT4. While nose receptors typically send messages to the brain, Sandalore’s receptor “triggered cells to divide and migrate” — an important process for healing damaged skin. The New York Times reported Sandalore helped skin abrasions heal 30% faster and researchers could apply it to cosmetic products for aging skin and recovery treatments after physical trauma.

"There are just a few precious weeks left of summer – and one way you can send this season off in style is with a Tiki party full of rum-based libations and island-inspired food.  The US Tiki trend reached its apex in the 1950s and 1960s. By this time, Ernest Raymond Beaumont Gantt and Vic Bergeron had each established their own empires of Polynesian-themed establishments that offered patrons an escape from the ordinary – and stiff drinks to boot.  Thanks in part to the rise of the craft cocktail movement, Tiki culture is back in the spotlight and can provide plenty of inspiration for bringing a bit of paradise to your own festivities.     Tiki cocktail. Photograph: Edsel Little/flickr     Decor When it comes time to set up for your Tiki party, try to avoid those tacky, technicolor decorations. If your budget allows, browse the tropical decor available from purveyors such as Oceanic Arts (legends of the southern California Tiki scene) or Cheeky Tiki (the go-to outfitters for South Seas style in the UK). A few pufferfish lanterns or netted fish floats in a dimly lit space can go a long way toward setting the proper scene. If your venue is outside, set up some Tiki torches and create a backyard theatre by projecting a movie on a screen or blank wall.  “Cinerama – South Seas Adventure” (1958) is a great choice as it presents a vivid tour of several South Pacific islands as they appeared more than a generation ago. The film hadn’t been show in theaters since the 1970s and had never been available for home viewing until recently, so consider yourself fortunate to have the opportunity to watch it today.  Food  For the menu, let’s look to Hawaii for ideas. An ambitious host may roast a whole pig but I prefer something a bit more low maintenance: pulled pork on sweet Hawaiian rolls (I recommend the sweet and super-flavorful Asian BBQ sauce from Hoboken Eddie’s.) Serve these sliders alongside a big bowl of macaroni salad, a staple side dish of the Hawaiian plate lunch.  And for dessert? Pineapple upside down cake is a retro crowd-pleaser that was popular in the 1920s, thanks to the easy availability of canned pineapple from Hawaii. Best of all, these dishes can all be prepared in advance so you can spend less time running around the kitchen and more time for sipping and socializing.  Drinks  Ideally, you’ll be drinking out of a Tiki mug or bowl, either scored from a thrift store or ordered from a contemporary company like Tiki Farm, which has been producing these special ceramic drinking vessels for more than a decade. They’ve created thousands of original designs – many taking the form of stylized Tikis (carved representations of Polynesian idols) but also some that bring in pop culture influence from sci-fi, monster movies and even steampunk.  The recipes for famous cocktails such as Don the Beachcomber’s Zombie were closely kept secrets. We owe gratitude to Jeff Berry (AKA “Beachbum Berry”, the proprietor of New Orleans Tiki bar Latitude 29) for bringing many of them to light in his books, which include Beachbum Berry’s Sippin’ Safari, Beachbum Berry Remixed and his most recent tome, Beachbum Berry’s Potions of the Caribbean.     A tiki mug: classic. Photograph: Sam Howzit/flickr    Nearly 250 classic and modern recipes can be at your fingertips with the iOS app Beachbum Berry’s Total Tiki ($9.99). Scroll through and you’ll find a few that can serve a crowd. The Rum Tropical is a 1960s punch that serves 20 and is a snap to whip up.  If you prefer to host a more intimate affair, then you’re in luck. Blair Reynolds was kind enough to share the recipe for the Volcano Bowl as prepared at Hale Pele, his Tiki bar in Portland, Oregon. It features two products from his BG Reynolds line of handcrafted tropical syrups and mixers, which are essentials for those seeking to recreate quality Tiki drinks at home.

"Camila Batmanghelidjh, founder of the recently closed Kids Company charity, reportedly has plans to open a food bank for up to 3,000 children and young people. Less than two weeks after the charity’s collapse, its former chief executive is set to open Kids Dining Room beneath a railway arch in Lambeth, south London, this week, the Sunday Times reported.    Related: Camila Batmanghelidjh: ‘I’m actually quite rigorous.

She said she would not be fronting it. “I am a dire cook.

Batmanghelidjh agreed to stand aside from her position in order to secure a £3m emergency restructuring grant, part of which was spent on overdue staff wages.

"You know the scenario: you invite some friends over for dinner and they graciously accept. But then the caveats begin: “Elspeth is gluten- and dairy-intolerant, and I don’t eat meat, fish or eggs.” Bread, milk, butter, cheese – the nation seems to have become intolerant of the foods that used to be household staples. Entire supermarket aisles are now devoted to “free-from” products, with the British market for gluten-free alone expected to grow to £561m by 2017. Whether it’s due to a genuine rise in food allergies, or simply because of a perception that “free from” is healthier, the trend for dairy- and gluten-free seems here to stay. Yet humans have been eating wheat and dairy products for millennia, apparently without harm. Has something changed, or are the “free-from” advocates taking us for an expensive – and rather joyless – ride? Part of the confusion stems from a muddling of the distinction between food allergy and intolerance. Food allergies do seem to be on the rise, but these are different from intolerances, for which there is no strong evidence of an increase – and in some cases, no specific medical explanation for their cause. A 2008 study published in the journal Allergy revealed that although 34% of parents reported food allergies in their children, only 5% of children were found to have a genuine allergy.   Related: Gluten-free: health fad or life-saving diet?    So what is the difference? Allergies, such as reactions to specific proteins in wheat or milk, involve the immune system, and can be life-threatening. Symptoms usually kick in within minutes of eating a problem food, and can include vomiting, lip swelling, a rash, wheeze, and a blocked or runny nose. They are also relatively rare – at least among adults. According to an Australian study, wheat allergy affects around 0.2% of adults, while cow’s milk allergy affects 0.1-0.5% of adults. For children, research suggests 2-3% of babies are affected in their first year of life. Then there’s coeliac disease, which affects 1% of the population, and is an autoimmune condition that causes serious harm if sufferers eat even small amounts of gluten-containing foods. Antibodies are generated against the gluten, but these also attack cells lining the gut, resulting in malnutrition.    Around 13% of adults claim to react when they eat gluten foods: only 0.8% of these have coeliac disease    Food intolerances, on the other hand, tend to generate symptoms such as bloating or abdominal pain, and these set in more slowly – sometimes several days after eating a problem food. They also aren’t thought to involve the immune system. “Although a lot of the symptoms can be very unpleasant, they generally aren’t life-threatening and don’t do any lasting damage,” says Maureen Jenkins, clinical director of the charity Allergy UK. Among the most commonly reported intolerances are those relating to dairy and gluten, but precise numbers are difficult to obtain because studies often rely on people self-reporting sensitivities to these foods. And while reliable diagnostic tests exist for food allergies and coeliac disease, there are no reliable tests for food intolerances (with the exception of that for lactose). That’s not to stop them being marketed, though. The tennis player Novak Djokovic, for instance, was diagnosed with gluten intolerance using a technique called applied kinesiology. Here, the person undergoing testing holds a food substance in his or her hand or mouth, while the practitioner looks for signs of muscle weakness. The American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology has stated that there’s “no evidence of diagnostic validity” for the technique.       Photograph: Getty Images    Other tests may sound more scientific, but they’re not necessarily any more reliable. Take IgG (immunoglobulin G) testing, which looks for antibodies against food substances in the blood. Unlike IgE antibodies that mediate allergies, IgG antibodies are produced by most of us in reaction to the foods we eat. But, “there is no evidence that food-specific IgG antibodies are involved in any disease processes,” says Stuart Jones, principal biochemist at King George hospital, London. The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology similarly states that IgG testing “does not indicate food allergy or intolerance”. And Tariq el-Shanawany, consultant clinical immunologist at Cardiff and Vale NHS Trust, says: “For the patients I’ve seen who have had it done, it hasn’t given them the answer that means their symptoms go away.” That’s not to say that intolerance to food substances such as gluten doesn’t exist. Approximately 13% of British adults claim to experience symptoms when they eat gluten-containing foods, according to one recent study – yet only 0.8% of the population have been formally diagnosed with coeliac disease. “There are non-coeliac patients who are reporting symptoms when they eat gluten. If you look at their gut tissue using a high-magnification microscope, you can see the small bowel is having a very rapid response to it,” says David Sanders, consultant gastroenterologist at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. “This is not an allergy or coeliac disease, but something is happening to them.” But is it actually the gluten that they are reacting to? Peter Gibson of the Alfred Hospital and Monash University in Melbourne conducted the world’s first randomised-controlled trial of gluten in non-coeliacs with gut symptoms, which found they felt better when they went gluten-free. However, subsequent studies have convinced him that it’s not the gluten they’re reacting to, but a set of sugars dubbed Fodmaps (fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols). These sugars attract water and feed gas-generating bacteria in the small intestine, resulting in bloating, flatulence and loose stools. People with sensitive bowels seem to have worse symptoms. “There’s no doubt that wheat is a major cause of bloating and abdominal problems. The trouble is that wheat has more than just gluten in it,” says Gibson. Although there may be a small subset of non-coeliacs who react to gluten through some as yet undiscovered pathway, he believes that for the vast majority, reducing the fodmap content of their diet could go a long way to easing their symptoms. But this doesn’t mean they have to cut out all wheat, barley and rye, as people with coeliac disease do. “You can probably still have a schnitzel with breadcrumbs on it, but you couldn’t have a bowl of pasta,” says Gibson. And fodmaps are found in other foods, too: particularly onions. Eliminating all fodmap-containing foods would be the first step, but these could gradually be reintroduced until you discover the level that triggers your symptoms.     Spaghetti sauce? A gluten-intolerant person might tolerate a garnish of breadcrumbs, but not a plate of pasta. Photograph: Alamy    Many of those opting to buy gluten-free products aren’t doing it because of abdominal symptoms, however. A recent survey of 100 British gluten-free shoppers found that 28% were doing it to boost their energy levels and 24% to lose weight; yet there’s no good evidence to support these purported health benefits. “A gluten-free diet is not healthier than any other diet,” Sanders says. Starch is the main source of calories in grains such as wheat, but the starch content of wheat is similar to that of other carbohydrates, such as rice or potatoes. “I think the idea that wheat or gluten is associated with weight gain has really come from the opposite angle; if you start to cut these products from your diet, then you start to lose weight,” adds Gary Frost, chair in nutrition and dietetics at Imperial College London. This is particularly true of high-calorie foods such as cakes, biscuits, or cheeseburgers. Apart from rubbing dinner party hosts up the wrong way, giving up gluten is unlikely to cause you much harm – provided you aren’t solely reliant on manufactured gluten-free products, which can be high in salt or sugar. The same can’t necessarily be said about avoiding milk and dairy products, however. These provide around a quarter of our daily protein requirement and up to 60% of other important nutrients such as calcium and phosphorus. “My biggest worry about the current trend for ditching cow’s milk relates to bone development in children and adolescents, and its long-term effect on bone strength in postmenopausal women,” says Ian Givens, professor of food chain nutrition at the University of Reading. Dairy intolerance is at least a condition for which there’s an established mechanism: approximately 65% of the world’s population carries a genetic variant that means they’re unable to digest the lactose in milk. Instead, this sugar passes into the small intestine where it feeds bacteria that generate gas and bloating. But lactose intolerance among Brits is less common, affecting approximately 5% of the population. Temporary lactose intolerance can also develop as a result of gastroenteritis and other illnesses, or after repeated courses of antibiotics. Even if you are lactose intolerant, studies suggest that you may be able to drink up to around 250 millilitres of milk in one sitting without symptoms, and possibly twice this amount spread through the day if consumed with food.   Related: Is gluten bad for your health?    So why are so many people ditching cow’s milk in favour of plant-based alternatives such as soy or almond milk? “I think a lot of people are buying products because they think it is trendy, or they assume those kinds of alternative milks are superior products,” says Sioned Quirke, a dietitian and a spokeswoman for the British Dietetic Association. “They are not a superior product in any way, shape or form.” With the exception of soy milk, plant-based milks are far lower in protein than cow’s milk. And unless they have been fortified, they are also poor sources of calcium and vitamin D. There’s also emerging evidence that people who consume large amounts of milk and dairy products are at lower risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and colorectal cancer, possibly because of the calcium in milk. Another possibility is that widespread publicity about food intolerance is prompting many people with unexplained symptoms such as bloating or stomach cramps to self-diagnose dairy intolerance. A recent survey by Allergy UK revealed that 44% of people who class themselves as dairy intolerant have not been diagnosed as such by a doctor; instead, they have used online information or undergone non-conventional tests. Seventy two per cent have removed all dairy from their diets, even though yoghurt and hard cheese contain very little lactose and are unlikely to trigger symptoms. Why then, are so many of us apparently eager to blame common foods for our ailments? “It’s a good thing that people are more aware of conditions like irritable bowel syndrome and lactose intolerance, but I think it tends to make people jump to conclusions when they’ve nothing wrong with them,” says Quirk. “Our bowels are very sensitive organs. If we have been ill, or if we’re stressed or run down, we often will have some type of bowel symptom.” Meanwhile, leaping on the food-intolerance bandwagon, when you’d actually just prefer not to eat gluten or dairy, can make it harder for people with genuine food-related illness. “If someone goes into a catering outlet and claims that they have a dairy allergy, but then says ‘Well actually, I can eat some sorts of dairy but I can’t eat others,’ it may give caterers the impression that food allergies don’t need to be taken seriously,” says Moira Austin, helpline and information manager at the Anaphylaxis Campaign. “It can give people with true food allergies a bad name.” If you do suspect you have a food intolerance, a key first step is to visit your GP. This is particularly important if you believe your symptoms are being caused by gluten; the coeliac disease test for coeliac disease only works if you’ve been eating the stuff daily for at least six weeks. Assuming that food allergies and coeliac disease are ruled out, removing suspect foods from your diet is the logical next step. “If your symptoms improve and you then reintroduce the food and they come back, then that proves you’re intolerant,” says Jenkins. And yet many people who attempt such elimination diets aren’t doing them properly, she cautions: “Often people don’t exclude for long enough; you need to do it for about a month. And if it doesn’t make a difference, you need to reintroduce that food into your diet. Most people don’t have enough nutritional knowledge to replace [foods] with other things to get the essential nutrients they need.” If you can hold up your hands and say you’ve been through these steps and you’re certain that gluten or dairy is the source of your problems, you’re probably correct: food intolerance is a real condition that deserves to be taken seriously. And, as a bonus, if you receive a proper diagnosis you may find your sceptical friends suddenly become a lot more tolerant of your intolerance.",2015-08-16T07:45:05Z,Leave it out: are food intolerances fact or fad?,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""deb755da91375f4759afef189f154486c1e25b8e""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/13/1439458565142/Novak-Djokovic-005.jpg"" alt=""Novak Djokovic"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Unforced error?

"  The average person doesn’t remember all the things that are in their cocktail, but they’ll remember if it was delicious  Jeff Bell     Australia’s Bundaberg Rum, more commonly referred to as Bundy by its fans, may not be the first spirit that springs to mind when considering world-class drinking. Its stereotype of being a particularly popular drink among working-class, uncomplicated young men is a tough one to shake, at least among Australians. But for Jeff Bell, who runs the world-renowned cocktail bar Please Don’t Tell, or PDT, in New York, Bundaberg has proven an inspiration. Bell has brought his bar to Melbourne for four nights only to showcase his mixes, dubbed by those in the bar-tending industry as being among the best in the world. While the bulk of the Melbourne PDT drinks list has been borrowed from its headquarters, Bell has incorporated Bundaberg, which is not imported into the US, into the pop-up’s menu. “I didn’t know much about Bundaberg before - it’s not a household item in the US, so what we hear about Bundaberg is what we hear from tourists,” Bell says.  “It was a lot of fun to work with because it had a distinct flavour, it’s made from a different cane which is grown in a different soil than other rums. I’ve tried rums all over the world, and it’s a flavour that’s not replicated anywhere else. Using Bundaberg was an opportunity to showcase out thought process, and the way we think about building on the base drink.”      Star attraction at The Attic, Black Pearl. Photograph: Graham Denholm/Leo Burnett Australia    The creative yet refined resulting blends are a far-cry from the sickly-sweet pre-mix drink Australians may associate with the rum.      ‘The drinks are among the very best cocktails I’ve tried.’ Photograph: Graham Denholm/Leo Burnett Australia    There’s the “Australian Libre”; a drink inspired by the traditional Cuba Libre but, rather than pairing the rum and lime with cola, Bundaberg small batch is muddled with demerara sugar, lime, and tiki bitters, a type of bitters infused with cinnamon and allspice. It’s a bold concoction with a strong cola kick, and unlike a Cuba Libre, the flavours are more elegant, more spicy than sweet.  Then there’s a Bundaberg and spanish brandy concoction, dubbed “Tying the Sheets,” mixed with lemon, green walnut, preserved figs and demerera sugar. I don’t try this one; instead as a gin lover, I opt for the Nichol Buck, a drink taken from the New York menu and which basically tastes like a very alcoholic lemon and honey drink. For this one, Tanqueray number 10 is combined with sherry, lemon, honey and ginger beer and garnished with a lemon slice and candied ginger. It’s a sweet and sour infusion, with a spicy twist. Yes; the drinks are among the very best cocktails I’ve tried. You’d expect that from a barman that was once selected to mix for Oprah Winfrey – Bell served her tequila mixed with lemon, Cilantro, orange oil and egg white. Despite not being much of a bourbon drinker, I try the strong, Bulleit-based “Sweet Tea Smash”. Combined with an Italian herbal liqueur, strega, and iced-tea, the mix is warming on a chilly Melbourne night. The ingredients are simple but together, create a complicated flavour that softens as the ice melts. But it’s not just the mixes that Bell says is key to a successful cocktail venue. As much thought has been put into the decor, which strongly replicates PDT New York and features dimmed lighting, taxidermy and empty spirit bottles hanging from the ceiling. Borrowing inspiration from prohibition-era speakeasy’s isn’t exactly new, but in New York, Bell was among the first to do it, and it does feel more sophisticated than gimmicky. “The average person doesn’t remember all five or six things that are in their cocktail, but they’ll remember if it was delicious,” Bell says.   Related: Five top new places to eat in Richmond, the 'Switzerland of Melbourne'     “They’ll remember the time that they had, if the lighting was too bright or dark, if the music was too loud or if the room was too cold or hot. Great bar-tending is about the whole experience and making sure people are comfortable. That’s what makes people have a positive memory of you, and means they will spend money at your bar.” Recommendation: “The Australian Libre” paired with “The Spicy Redneck” - house sausage wrapped in bacon, chilli, coleslaw and jalepeno and served in a hot-dog bun.

"Genoa was a medieval rival to Venice. It’s not been primped for tourists like Venice, though. Genoa was a shipbuilding centre and is a working city – it has an affinity with Liverpool, Glasgow or Newcastle. Some people think it’s a bit grubby, but if you enjoy getting off the tourist trail and finding out about a real Italian city, it’s got so much to offer.     Nicholas Walton. Photograph: Nicholas Walton    The city is tiered like a wedding cake, rising above the old port. The funicular railway runs to Righi for fantastic views, or there’s an elevator (it goes sideways as well as up and down) to Castello d’Albertis, a bizarre museum. Below here there’s a lovely statue of a young Christopher Columbus, who was from Genoa, staring out to sea. Genoa is the oldest football club in Italy and has a football museum. Go to a derby match (Genoa v Sampdoria) if you can, I always go with my father-in-law: it’s another way to see the real city. There’s an amazing tiny chocolate shop on Vico dei Castagna called Romeo Viganotti, that the Genoese like to think only they can find. Owner Alessandro Boccardo is a shy Willy Wonka-type character, quite otherworldly, who makes all kinds of amazing experimental flavours (the onion one didn’t quite work) with 200-year-old machinery. The boxes are beautiful and make great presents. My book starts with the story of the transsexual prostitutes who live in the medieval centre (the largest in Europe). Around one corner you may have an old violin-maker, around the next the prostitutes. Stencilled signs put up by US forces at the end of the second world war can be spotted in the little streets on the edge of the port. They warned soldiers not to go into town because they could be stabbed, get lost or catch something from a prostitute. It wasn’t picture-postcard Italy back then.     Castello d’Albertis, which can be reached by elevator from the city below.  Photograph: Alamy    Pesto here is astonishing: so vivid, so green. You’ll always be disappointed with any other after tasting it in its hometown. The Genoese also love tripe. You see schoolchildren wandering along with little cardboard cones that in Britain would be stuffed with chips, but here they’re full of glistening tripe. Da Maria is a cheap trattoria on Vico Testadoro, serving the food an Italian grandmother would cook – pasta, rabbit, octopus. Office workers go there for lunch and you join the scrum to pay downstairs. At the other end of the scale is Zeffirino, run by a charismatic guy who knew Sinatra and cooked for Pavarotti – who is said to have rented a flat above the restaurant. I remember having a delicious sea bream with taggiasca olives and tomato there – a level above anything I’ve had.     Trenette al pesto, at Zeffirino restaurant in Genoa. Photograph: Italo Banchero/AP    There are amazing wine bars all over Genoa, but the one I go to with my wife (who’s from here) is Cantine Matteotti, hidden on a tiny street called Archivolto Baliano. They just scribble the wines they have open on a blackboard – about 10 white, 10 red and a couple of sparkling – and serve simple plates of cold meat or aubergine parmigiana. It’s really atmospheric with marble tabletops and a zinc bar. In any other city you’d come out feeling like you’d been mugged but here you might spend €20 between you and come home happy and sloshed. Many hotels here are business-focused, but Vecchia Genova, set up by former BA flight attendants, is beautiful with reasonable rates. You can also find some fantastic Airbnb places in the atmospheric buildings overlooking the port. Visit the Galata Museum in the old shipbuilding site on the waterfront to get your head around the city’s naval history. There’s a reconstruction of one of the old war galleons that dominated the Mediterranean from the time of Ben Hur to the 16th century. It was a real merchant pirate city, they took what they could from the harsh life of the seas.     The Galata Museum, at Porto Antico in the city.

"McDonald’s is responding to increased competition in the fast food market by entering the slow lane. The home of the Big Mac and the rapid-fire eating experience is offering table service in the UK for the first time.  The company is trialling the new approach at a branch in Mottram, Greater Manchester, and plans to roll it out to 11 more locations by the end of the month, before taking the system nationwide. For those who prefer to queue, there will still be the option of ordering at the till. The embrace of table service is the latest attempt to modernise the image of McDonald’s restaurants in the face of competition from gourmet burger brands such as Five Guys and Shake Shack, Mexican chains such as Chipotle, and established rivals Burger King and KFC.   Related: McDonald's in crisis: can it fight off the Five Guys threat?    Customers will be able to order from digital kiosks or staff with tablet computers, with the food then delivered to their table. The initiative is targeted at young families and customers who do not want to wait at the traditional McDonald’s counter. McDonald’s first opened in Britain in 1974 and now has more than 1,250 restaurants in the UK. It has trialled table service in restaurants in France, Germany, Switzerland and Australia. However, the ambitious UK launch represents a notable step up for the strategy as the chief executive, Steve Easterbrook, a Briton, tries to breathe new life into a brand that is struggling in the US in particular. While McDonald’s has enjoyed 37 consecutive quarters of growth in the UK, it is in decline in its home market. The poor US performance led to a 14% fall in group profits in 2014, one of the worst performances in McDonald’s history. Easterbrook, who was appointed to the top job in January after a long career at the chain, punctuated by spells at Wagamama and Pizza Express, is under pressure to revive one of the world’s most famous brands. He has pledged to deliver a “sharper focus” on McDonald’s customers and return excitement to the golden arches, while admitting that the world’s largest burger chain was “not on our game” and had allowed its menu to become too complicated. So far this year, McDonald’s has pressed ahead with a string of measures designed to overhaul struggling restaurants across the world. These include the launch of an all-day breakfast menu, allowing customers to build their own burgers, a customer complaint app in Japan and a pledge to stop selling chicken raised with antibiotics. The new managing director of McDonald’s UK, Paul Pomroy, is overseeing a refurbishment programme of the company’s restaurants estimated to be costing more than £350m. This includes providing Apple iPads and Samsung Galaxy tablets that children can play with, installing digital kiosks where customers can make orders and building glass shopfronts on McDonald’s restaurants. About 250 McDonald’s restaurants will have been revamped by the end of the year. Pomroy said McDonald’s was making changes to restaurants and introducing table service in response to customer feedback. He said the company would not increase prices to pay for the overhaul.  “We have listened to customer feedback and to meet their evolving expectations, we are significantly investing in our restaurants to create an exciting new environment and improve the customer experience,” Pomroy, who replaced Halfords-bound Jill McDonald earlier this year, said. “We also plan to test some new ideas. For example, we know that for parents it can be tough juggling the kids and carrying your food, so we have decided to trial table service, whereby customers place their order via our new kiosks and then have their food brought to them.  “It is currently on test in one restaurant here in the UK, but with plans to increase the trial to about a dozen restaurants over the coming month. It’s an idea that has been successfully launched in France, and we are keen to see if it will prove as popular with our customers in the UK.” Neil Saunders, a retail and consumer analyst at Conlumino in the US, said McDonald’s faced a battle with the thousand of franchisees who run the chain’s 36,000 restaurants around the world to modernise its sites and menu.   Related: Still not lovin' it: McDonald's sales in US drop for seventh straight quarter    He said: “The store experience is generally poor and is not inspiring or inviting for customers. The firm has loads of old outlets across the US which are in need of upgrading. Generally, the store estate is in a much worse condition to the UK. To be fair, McDonald’s has made a start and is making stores more contemporary and nicer to dwell in, but there is a lot of work still to be done.” Referring to the so-called fast casual phenomenon that has seen McDonald’s lose customers among younger people in particular, he added: “The menu choices need updating. While younger consumers do not dislike McDonald’s per se, they do have more sophisticated tastes and more options to exercise those tastes – like Chipotle.  “McDonald’s is challenged as it needs to both stick to its core menu and provide some variety and more exciting options.” Warning of a potential struggle with franchisees, he said: “At present, franchisees are under a lot of pressure financially and many are disgruntled about menu complexity and other changes McDonald’s has been making. McDonald’s has not done a great job in communicating its future strategy and probably needs to give more financial support to franchisees if it wants to up the pace of change.” ",2015-08-05T17:59:39Z,Happier meal?

"Major “shocks” to global food production will be three times more likely within 25 years because of an increase in extreme weather brought about by global warming, warns a new report. The likelihood of such a shock, where production of the world’s four major commodity crops – maize, soybean, wheat and rice – falls by 5-7%, is currently once-in-a-century. But such an event will occur every 30 years or more by 2040, according to the study by the UK-US Taskforce on Extreme Weather and Global Food System Resilience. Such a shortfall in production could leave people in developing countries in “an almost untenable position”, with the US and the UK “very much exposed” to the resulting instability and conflict, said co-author Rob Bailey, research director for energy, environment and resources at Chatham House.   Related: Produced but never eaten:  a visual guide to food waste    Prof Tim Benton, professor of population ecology at the University of Leeds and co-author of the report, said that the compound effects of climate change and rising demand from a growing population could create a “very frightening” situation. “The food system is increasingly under pressure because demand is growing and our ability to supply it is much more constrained. On top of that we have climate change affecting where we can grow things.  “If we are coping with demand increases by sustainable intensification but then suddenly we have a catastrophic year and lose a significant chunk of the world’s calories, everybody will feel it.”  Such shocks could plausibly see the UN’s food price index – which measures the international price of major commodities – rocket by 50%, based on an analysis of how the market would likely respond.  The report, which was supported by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, stresses that extreme weather events such as floods or droughts are just as significant as rising average temperatures and rainfall.  Increased food production volatility will mostly affect developing countries experiencing high levels of poverty and political instability, such as countries in the Gulf or Sub-Saharan Africa. Bailey said: “The most vulnerable countries, which will be the worst affected – whether at the macroeconomic level or at the household level – the poorest households spend upwards of 50% of their income on food. If you are in a situation where food prices are increasing by 50-100%, that leaves them in an almost untenable position.” But while larger economies would be less directly impacted and more able to absorb rising food prices, he said “countries like the UK and the US are very much exposed to the indirect consequences”. Such consequences could include the likely increased instability of countries in North Africa, where the inflation of food prices was a factor in causing the Arab Spring and which relies heavily on food imports.  As climate change causes temperatures to rise even higher in the second half of the century, even more serious food shocks – where production drops by up to 10% – are also likely to occur much more often by 2070.  Extreme weather events in North and South America and north-east Asia – where production of the four major crops is concentrated – are likely to have the biggest impact on global food production. In 1988/89, droughts in the US and South America lead to drops in the production of maize and soybean by 12% and 8.5% respectively.  The UN issued a warning last year that global food production must rise by 60% by 2050 in order to avoid social unrest and civil wars caused by serious food shortages. Rising demand is caused by increased wealth and a growing world population that is expected to reach 9.7 billion by mid-century. The report recommends that governments need to work together on the international level, with significant investments from the public and private sectors required to make the global food system more resilient to climate change. It follows a warning last month by a UK foreign minister that climate change poses a risk equivalent to nuclear weapons, in part because of its impact on food security.

"The cleverest thing in your smart fridge may not be an automated re-ordering button, web-connected camera that tweets when your milk is off, or some other silly convenience system, but the food itself. Agriculture has been quick to trial internet of things (IoT) technologies: already, sensor-controlled rooms are growing altered lettuce, cows are connected to improve milk, and the all-important bee is getting a boost from automated heaters. For food production, the IoT makes sense. Not only does it have the potential to cut costs and boost food production – with a report by Beecham Research predicting that the use of IoT techniques for farming could boost food production by 70% by 2050 – but the use of sensors can also improve animal welfare and reduce the use of resources such as water.  Plus, unlike the other areas of our lives where the internet of things is creeping in, there’s no privacy concerns – unless you’re worried about cows being surveilled. Agriculture is one area of the IoT where there’s little downside, and a host of benefits. The internet of things next trick? Improving lettuce ... As it turns out, lettuce isn’t good for everyone. It’s high in potassium, so can be unhealthy for people to eat when on dialysis or suffering chronic kidney disease. To make salads for those with kidney problems, Fujitsu and Microsoft teamed up to grow high-tech lettuce. As odd as it sounds, the project highlights how sensors can be used to help agricultural plants grow faster and better, creating higher yields as well as unique specialisations – if they can do this with lettuce, imagine what they can do with wine grapes.      The potassium in lettuce is bad for people on dialysis or suffering chronic kidney disease. Thanks to IoT, Fujitsu has produced a raw lettuce with less than 80% of potassium as a traditional lettuce. Photograph: Hiroshi Higuchi/Getty Images    “The hardware sensors are similar to what you see in any semiconductor plant,” said Enrique Andaluz, Director of Strategic Business Development for Worldwide Discrete Manufacturing at Microsoft. Indeed, Fujitsu’s test bed is a chip plant that’s been converted to grow IoT-managed plants. “The information is picked from building sensors that control temperature, humidity, CO2, light intensity and other factors that affect the ‘perfect conditions’ to grow crops.” That data is handed to Microsoft’s Azure cloud, where it’s analysed for reports and to send alerts about its care. All this data means it’s possible to fine tune the conditions to grow low-potassium lettuce. “To reduce the level of potassium at home, you typically cook the raw vegetables to change their internal chemical composition,” said Andaluz. And who wants cooked lettuce? “Fujitsu has been able to produce a raw lettuce with less than 80% of potassium content as compared to traditional grown lettuce.” Thanks to the IoT, crunchy salads for all.  Connected cows Up there with smart fridges, connected cows are a staple of IoT stories, and with good reason – the idea of web-connected cows is hilarious. The cows aren’t simply tweeting their position to online followers, however. Under a project run by Dr Jonathan Amory at Writtle College, sensors are tracking dairy cows to help farmers spot illnesses earlier, creating an early-warning system for disease that hopefully cuts suffering for the animals and improves milk yields. The researchers say lameness and diseases such as mastitis cost the dairy industry as much as £100m annually in the UK alone. “Lots of diseases are tricky to spot and time consuming to monitor formally, so having a tool which could flag up cows with possible problems sooner and allow earlier treatment would be really valuable,” said Zoe Barker, the post-doctoral research assistant who runs the project, and is now an expert in sticking sensors to cows.     Under a project run by Dr Jonathan Amory at Writtle College, sensors are tracking dairy cows to help farmers spot illnesses earlier, creating an early-warning system for disease. Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian    For this research, she said the cows were given a collar that included a positioning sensor, with an accelerometer and magnetometer – though, sadly, no adorable little cow bell. The collars were fitted to a group of more than a hundred cows for six months, with the sensors returning a position on the beasts every 10 seconds, generating data sheets with a million rows of data for each day. Why does it matter where cows are? Simply put, a cow that’s lying down away from the others is more likely to be sick. “We felt that position was important to understand not only the behaviour of the individual cows but also their social behaviour,” Barker said. “Without position, it’s not possible to know how the cows are interacting with each other and how this changes with health status or other management influences.” The researchers had to adapt a system that had been used previously to track carts in mines and to follow firefighters – beasts on a farm is a very different environment indeed. “Once we sorted the optimum tightness of the neck collars, we reduced the number of whole collars lost by the cows in their shed,” she said. “A bigger issue was the cows ripping the plastic box we were using to house an external battery, and ripping the sensor off of the collar and losing that somewhere in the house.” Cows weren’t the only problem. “In addition to our destructive cows, the large amount of metal in a modern cow shed caused a moderate reduction in accuracy due to the potential for deflection of radio waves on the metal,” she added. The huge quantity of collected data now needs to be analysed – mathematicians are creating algorithms, and Barker is in the middle of writing up her paper on the project now – but the hope is it can be used to predict when cows get sick, she said. “If we can create the predictive model then we will be able to detect the changes in individual cow behaviour and social behaviour changes that are associated with the onset of disease, and therefore inform the farmer,” she said. “For diseases such as lameness, where the onset is slow and where clinical symptoms may be masked for a time, we can flag up the issue sooner. Sooner treatment usually means less severe symptoms, less pain, faster recovery and less risk of having a repeat treatment.” These aren’t the only connected cows trodding fields. Alongside its smart lettuce, Fujitsu has given cattle step trackers. “By using pedometers in the cows and bulls farmers are able to predict the best time for mating and to determine whether cattle has healthy living conditions,” said Microsoft’s Andaluz. “For instance, now we know that when cows are in heat, they walk longer distances at a faster pace. By analysing the data on the cow pedometer, it is now easier to find that unique moment for both the cow and the bull to be put next to each other to increase impregnation chances. This translates [to a] 50% increase of meat production as well as to the eliminate risk of disseminating diseases due to prompt diagnosis of diseases in the farm.” Plus, you can find out how many cows pass the 10,000 step count goal. The internet of bees Agriculture is doomed without bees, and so are we. Without bees to pollinate, crops don’t continue and we can’t feed our connected cows. But bees are in trouble. Their numbers have been in sharp decline, and no one is entirely sure why. One explanation for colony collapse disorder (CCD), as the disaster is known, is a type of mite – and researchers at the University of Minnesota and a firm called Eltopia have a solution that pops the plague like popcorn while keeping bees and hives safe. Eltopia chief executive Will McHugh started his career on his family cherry farm, working with local bee keepers on tech even then to alter how the trees were pollinated. While working on that project, the keepers mentioned a mite that was attacking their bees. Those mites can be killed by heat, which doesn’t bother the bees but does melt the wax that makes up their hives. So MacHugh and his fellow researchers developed a way to heat up specific spots in a hive from the inside, rather than heating the entire structure, using circuitry that’s screen-printed on to a hive base, called the foundation. “We have printed circuitry on PLA (corn-based) plastic film that is coated with beeswax and impressed with a honeycomb pattern upon which the worker bees can draw out the comb,” said co-founder Aaron Seelye. “The ink is a special type that can both act as a temperature sensor one moment, and a heater the next. By taking cues from the environment, we can interrupt the reproductive cycle of the Varroa Mite, which is widely considered the leading cause of CCD.” There are points when the mites can be interrupted by temperature changes. When worker bees see that viable larvae are in a spot in the honeycomb, they top it with a wax cap to protect the offspring. That means the temperature stabilises – and when that happens, Eltopia’s MiteNot tech kicks into gear. “What our electronics do is two things: they monitor temperature and they produce heat,” he said. When the temperature stabilises, sensors spot it, and the electronics automatically start generating heat, killing the mites without harming the bees. “If you heat the mites up to 107 degrees or 108 degrees, all the mites die,” MacHugh said. “The bees actually kind of like it. The mites, because they’re so much smaller, it almost pops them like popcorn.” Alongside killing off the troublesome mites, the system also collects other data. “In conjunction with this application, we’re working on things such as audio sensors, temperature and humidity, and durable scale, to tell honey gain [or] loss in a given timeframe),” added Seelye. MacHugh pointed out that it’s “too early in the game” to say if Eltopia’s MiteNot is solving the CCD problem, as the technology has only been rolled out in the last month or so, and it’s not clear whether mites are entirely to blame for the mass deaths of bees. “Removing [or] reducing the mites as a parasitic influence on the colony can only serve to do good for the overall health of our bee colonies, which are a critical component of our food supply,” added Seelye. But Eltopia’s technology could be a first step in changing how we keep pests off the plants we intend to eat. MacHugh pointed out that much of the discussion around food supply centres on pesticides.  “There’s a real battle in agriculture – over organic v inorganic, pesticides v GMO, etc,” he said. “I would just say that we’re really focused on not giving in to those arguments and coming up with a solution that’s sustainable.” He stressed he has nothing against pesticides – they were engineered for reason – but it’s understandable that some people don’t want their food covered in chemicals, either. “And it turns out we may not need them.”",2015-08-05T14:27:00Z,The internet of food: why your steak might have come from a connected cow,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""a31e552374a166dde5e5ee9d3b14ff1c5d1e0416""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/5/1438767457493/4303cafe-087c-47b2-8155-bb02cb0c4d8e-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""A T-bone steak "" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">In the future, will all T-bone steaks be produced from IoT-aided farming?</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: D.

"If Laura Waters didn’t have a summer holiday project nearby where her three children, Scott, 12, Aiden, seven and Declan, six, are fed, supervised and entertained five days a week, she would “have no idea what we would do,” she says. Waters, who lives in south-west Glasgow with her partner and sons, is not working – any job she can find would bring in less than the cost of childcare, she says – and because her partner has only been able to get part-time work, they are living hand to mouth. “At the moment, we have to scrape by on part-time wages and tax credits. It’s barely enough, so the summer holidays don’t mean trips abroad or days out – they mean worrying about being able to feed everyone”, she says.    In Scotland  mothers are able to tell of one of the most difficult summers yet for parents in socially deprived areas    In Scotland, the summer holidays began in June and schoolchildren now have only a week left before they return – so mothers like Waters are able to tell a tale of one of the most difficult summers yet for parents in socially deprived areas like hers. “Our tax credits have been cut”, she says. “I know a lot of mums in this area who have had their benefits cut too, or sanctioned. Some have been to food banks this summer. Some are too proud, but they’re making choices like, shall I feed the meter or the kids, or shall I go without food myself to make sure they have something?”. The holiday club Waters’s three children attend between 10am and 3pm is one of many projects in Scotland set up either by charities or local councils. She describes the meal they receive there as “a lifesaver”. , but the social aspect is important too. “There’s nothing for kids in this area. I don’t want them hanging about the streets. At least at the club I know they’re safe.” she says. Celebrating its 10th birthday this summer, the club based at Barrhead high school and Eastwood high school, was set up after a local boy on free school meals was caught stealing food from a shop during the school holidays. It is funded and run by East Renfrewshire council. Loraine Lawrie, facilities management quality manager at the council, says: “It’s like a family. We all sit down, with adults at each table. It’s about the food – but it’s also about everyone eating together, and that’s how the kids learn. Some of them rarely use cutlery, because at home they may be eating takeaways with their hands.” Lindsay Graham, UK school food and health policy adviser and chair of the all party parliamentary group’s holiday hunger task group agrees that projects like this aren’t just about feeding children. “They’re also about nurture, routine and structure,” she says. “The UK has invested billions of pounds in school meals. However, in the holidays, that really valuable investment in the next generation just stops.” There are around 1.7 million children in the UK eligible for free school meals, who could be going without a daily meal during school holidays. There are on average 170 no-school days a year in the UK. Graham has found hundreds of organisations helping pupils on a local level, often using existing staff and resources such as public buildings, schools and community venues, but she says they are all frustrated that there is not more government support. “No single government department will take responsibility for this, and, while it is an age-old problem, austerity means that it’s getting worse,” she says.   Related: A good breakfast goes a long way towards tackling child hunger | Carmel McConnell    A report released last month on holiday hunger, based on a study of 580 low- and middle-income parents, found that 62% of parents on less than £25,000 a year can’t always afford food in holidays; for parents with incomes of less than £15,000 the figure rose to 73%, while 41% of parents in low-income families had skipped meals during holidays so that their children could eat. The research, carried out in England, Scotland and Wales on behalf of Kellogg’s, echoes Waters’ experiences, with 24% of parents prioritising food over paying a household bill, 14% serving smaller meals during the school holidays to keep costs down, and 38% saying that they’d bought cheaper – and perhaps less healthy – food. In addition, 22% said they had avoided having their children’s friends over and 17% hadn’t invited family to their house during the holidays due to a lack of money and food. The report, Isolation and Hunger: the reality of the school holidays for struggling families, also highlights the isolation experienced by parents unable to afford to go out and entertain their children and who end up stuck at home. Lisa Ewart lives in Ardrossan, in south-west Scotland, with her husband Stephen, who works part-time, and three children, Letisha, 13, Brendyn, 10 and Alister, nine. They receive benefits – although they are bracing for themselves for the cut in tax credits. “The summer holidays are tough this year. There’s no way we can afford any activities on top of extra food shopping. But the kids, especially Alister, who has autism, need to be busy, they need to be in a routine, and they need food in their tummies”, she says. Thankfully Ewart’s children have been attending a local project called Make A Meal of It. There is another in neighbouring Ardeer. Craig Crosthwaite, who co-ordinates Make A Meal Of It, says they have been busy over the summer. “We’re open 11am to 1pm and this year we’ve reached full quota [25 meals a day on each site]. But we’re not a soup kitchen for kids. It has to be an hour of activity first, like sport, or craft, and then an hour for the meal,” he says. “What we don’t want to do is embed a sense of poverty in the minds of these young people – who knows how that could affect them as they grow up.” The two projects are supported by Make Lunch, a network of churches offering free lunches to children in the holidays. Crosthwaite explains that by teaming up with Make Lunch, not only is there quality assurance, but they become part of a UK-wide research programme that Make Lunch will be undertaking to learn more about the scale and nature of holiday hunger. Graham welcomes research like this. “There needs to be a thorough investigation. Holiday meals and enrichment isn’t for every school or community but where there is a need, support should be available. Under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child we are failing to provide children’s right to food.” Earlier this year, the then Scottish first minister Alec Salmond announced free school meals for all children regardless of income for the first three years of primary school in Scotland, which, the Scottish government says, aims to “support the development of young people and tackle inequalities in society, including the scourge of child poverty”. It estimates this is saving parents around £380 a year. So is the Scottish government planning to put money into tackling holiday hunger? A Holyrood spokeswoman says: “We want to do much more and we will consider all proposals in our work to tackle child poverty where it occurs.” Jackie Brock, chief executive of the charity Children in Scotland, says that policies are in place on food and wellbeing in term-time, making Scotland well placed to step up action. “Scotland has gone a long way to address hunger for young children during term-time, but we now need to focus on how we can support families during holidays when pressures are most intense”, she says. In 2014, research by Kellogg’s found that more than a third of teachers in the UK noticed pupils lost weight during the summer break and it launched a holiday breakfast club programme. Graham is confident that Scotland will be the first place in the UK where improvement happens. She wants more research, investment in a fund to beat holiday hunger and a framework for supporting communities to deliver programmes. “From my experience in policy and practice around school food, wellbeing and education in Scotland, the local and national relationships are more cohesive than the rest of the UK – and more likely to be in a good place to help make holiday provision happen more quickly, should they decide to do it,” she says. Graham visited the East Renfrewshire programme last week. “I saw 120 kids sit down and have lunch together – it restores your faith in human nature and shows what’s possible with effort”, she says. “There are projects like this popping up all over Scotland, and the rest of the UK – but now the government has to step up. If 2015 is going to be the worst summer yet for holiday hunger, let’s make it the year that something changes, too.”",2015-08-05T06:30:01Z,Benefit cuts mean this summer holiday has been even more hungry than usual,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""61057bbf91df12af72e2cffeda251809d5ef0c8a""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/3/1438612131777/7e06f8c0-f067-43a2-99f4-9602dfca41cc-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""For brothers Declan, Aiden and Scott Waters the lunch they get each day at Barrhead high school’s holiday club is a ‘lifesaver’."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">For brothers Declan, Aiden and Scott Waters the lunch they get each day at Barrhead high school’s holiday club is a ‘lifesaver’.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: HEMedea</span> </figcaption> </figure>",47,High demand for Scottish charities giving youngsters hot meals in the holidays shows the devastating impact of benefit cuts as parents struggle to feed their children while schools are shut,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/3/1438612132133/7e06f8c0-f067-43a2-99f4-9602dfca41cc-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/05/children-low-income-families-hungry-in-school-holidays-cant-afford-food,9,negative
"In May this year, the Telica volcano in north-west Nicaragua erupted. During the two weeks that followed, over 500 gas explosions were recorded, expelling large amounts of ash and rocks. Less than 1km away, the community of Agua Fría found rocks had fallen dangerously close to their homes, still scorching hot from the vent of the volcano.   Related: Dodgy fertiliser is keeping Uganda hungry    Before that, Telica last erupted in 2011 when unfavourable wind conditions put some of the communities closest to the crater at considerable risk. A longer-lasting impact of the 2011 eruption was the damage caused to crops. Most families on Telica rely on subsistence farming for food. Many farmers’ bean crops were devastated by ash and heavy rain acidified the sulphur dioxide produced by the eruption. Families had to find ways to cope with less food that year. People were forced to sell their assets, leave their homes to find work elsewhere and live on meagre diets.  The communities living on Telica face many of the challenges that come with living in marginalised rural areas. Many earn less than $1.25 per day, living below the absolute poverty line as set by the World Bank. These eruptions highlight the dangers that come with living on the slopes of a volcano. But even at times of no eruptions, people in the area are highly vulnerable to food insecurity. Telica’s farmers are reliant on a limited number of rainfed crops, namely beans and maize. If there is too little or too much rain, or a disease outbreak, crop yield is reduced and diets and livelihoods are compromised. Being on a volcano, there is no capacity to irrigate. This makes farming particularly difficult in drought years such as this one. El Niño weather patterns have resulted in little rainfall in the first half of the wet season. It is vital that sufficient rain falls at this time, as it is when farmers plant their crops.      Farmers are encouraged to grow pineapples as a cash crop. Photograph: Nuevas Esperanzas    The exposed nature of Telica’s slopes causes valuable soil to be eroded by wind and rain. This soil erosion is further compounded by deforestation to make more land available for agriculture. Many farmers invest large proportions of their savings into chemical fertilisers and pesticides, hoping to boost yields. However, debt often forces them to sell their produce as soon as harvest time comes, when supply is high and prices are low. They get little return for their investments, only to see prices rise later on.  Nuevas Esperanzas, a local NGO, is using model farms to address many of the factors that compound food insecurity and poverty on the Telica volcano. Crop diversification is key. Cash crops, such as coffee and cocoa, are planted alongside staple crops, such as beans and maize. Different varieties are being planted, targeting those that are more drought-tolerant and adaptable to acidic conditions, such as pineapple and dragon fruit. An agroforestry system is being developed as coffee and cocoa plants need shade. Avocado, mango and orange trees will provide this as well as producing fruit that can be sold for income.  Access to markets can be a problem so road-side stalls will be set up, enabling the farmers to engage directly with their customers. This is complemented by training in marketing and business planning.      Members of the community learn agricultural techniques that they can then use on their own farms.  Photograph: Rosie Iron    Within the model farms, vegetable gardens are being managed using agro-ecology methods. Where possible, natural processes, are being used – instead of chemical fertilisers, nitrogen-fixing plants are being planted among rows of crops, acting as a form of natural fertiliser. These methods help prevent the buildup of financial debt and are more beneficial to the environment. Significant effort goes into promoting soil health, which increases water retention and promotes crop growth. The aim is to grow more food using the limited land and water resources that are available. Alongside the farms, beehives provide an additional source of income and encourage conservation of the surrounding forest.  Nuevas Esperanzas’ agricultural experts provide weekly training days at the farms. Members of the community learn agricultural techniques as well as training in finance and selling crops commercially. They can then take what methods work for them to use on their own farms. Profits from selling fruits and honey produced on the model farms is shared among them.  One exercise involved participants going to the market and speaking directly to vendors about the prices of pineapple and dragon fruit. They were then asked to calculate the cost of producing these crops to see the potential income.  “All were surprised to calculate that the unit cost of producing these crops were extremely low,” says Enrique Bolaños, Nuevas Esperanzas’ agricultural engineer. “They realised that the largest investment is in buying the plant material. And this investment brings better income. This is now in their hands, as they don’t need to buy new plant material. Cuttings from the pineapple plants on the model farms can be taken and reproduced on their own farms.” Vulnerability to food insecurity on the Telica volcano is complex and dependent on many factors. The model farms aim to take a holistic approach. The seeds are sown for the improvement of food security on Telica. The next few years will be important in judging whether the model farms are successful in meeting their objectives.  Rosie Iron is the UK coordinator for Nuevas Esperanzas.

"Nikki Bensted-Smith has a way of getting people to change their minds and, as head chef of the Warehouse Café in Birmingham, she’s getting something of a reputation. Having been with the hugely popular restaurant for just over a year (it’s rated the top vegetarian restaurant in Birmingham on TripAdvisor and the third best overall) she’s been inspiring locals to try vegetarian food and is beginning to introduce more and more raw dishes to the menu.   Related: Raw recipes | Readers Recipe Swap    “Many people are sceptical when I talk about raw food,” she says. “They think it’s mainly salads and juices but there are so many techniques you can use to create amazing dishes.”  Contrary to how it sounds, raw cuisine does not only include completely raw ingredients. The aim is not to heat food above 49C (120F). “It can be difficult to get the balance of flavours,” says Nikki. “Usually in cooking, you tend to cook the flavours out, which doesn’t happen in raw food preparation.”  There are many ways of introducing flavour and texture. “You can soak nuts and sprouts to soften them,” explains Nikki. “For example, we’ll be using sprouting lentils for the dahl at the event and the nuts will be soaked for the yoghurt carrot halva; by soaking them, they blend a lot better.” “I’ll also be using a dehydrator to make the pastry for the samosa.” A dehydrator is a square box with little trays that uses a fan and low temperatures to dry out food. “They don’t go above a certain temperature (about 50C), so you’re not cooking food,” says Nikki.  Raw foodies want to avoid heating food above 40-49C - as this temperature destroys enzymes in the food making it less nutritious. “Also there are no extra oils - we tend to use a bit of olive oil but don’t need anything extra for cooking - as raw food people argue that frying oil releases carcinogens. So it’s seen as clean living for your body,” says Nikki.     Nikki Bensted-Smith at The Warehouse Cafe, Allison Street, Birmingham. Tristan Potter Photograph: Tristan Potter/Guardian    To make her wraps for the event Nikki will blend carrot with brown flaxseed, water and spices, and will then spread on the dehydrating machine and heat slowly for eight hours. “So there’s not much room for error,” she says. “If you mess it up, you can’t just create another one. You have to be really organised. We also need large quantities of fresh food so you also need to factor that in.” Nikki’s love of raw food stems from her decision to turn vegan nine years ago. “I was one of those kids whose mum never enjoyed cooking and ate a lot of pre-packed food from the supermarket as a result,” she says. “I had a vegan friend at college. The first thing I made was a really bad curry. I bought some tinned lentils and threw in some spices.”     If you mess it up, you can’t just create another one. You have to be really organised    At university she became a key organiser for animal rights groups promoting veganism within the local community through food fairs, then once back at home in Norwich she volunteered at the Greenhouse, a community-run veggie café. “I went on to organise the Norwich Veggie Fair, a vegan fair which is now celebrating its fourth year.” As we’re taking Nikki’s photograph for this piece two tourists turn up at the cafe, guide books in hand, hugely disappointed to find it closed. And a TripAdvisor review posted on the day I visited by Laura_HanleyGorton sums up the experience. “I am not a vegetarian and wouldn’t normally go for the veggie options at restaurants but, dining at the Warehouse Café has completely changed my view on vegetarian food.”      Carpaccio of Beetroot with Heritage carrots &amp; Bitter walnut dressing Photograph: Nikki Bensted-Smith/Nikki Bensted Smith - Warehouse Cafe    Four raw tips for beginners • Sprouting Soak your choice of aduki beans, chickpeas, green lentils or mung beans overnight. Rinse, drain and leave in a warm place. Rinse and drain once/twice a day for four to five days. • Courgette hummus  Peel and chop two courgettes. Blend  with a teaspoon of tahini, a little garlic and a squeeze of lemon juice, adding ground cumin, paprika and salt to taste. Turn this into a wrap by filling lettuce leaves with hummus, sun-dried olives and fresh herbs. • Courgette noodles and pesto Peel a couple of courgettes and run through a spiral slicer. For the pesto, blend some pine nuts/walnuts and basil with salt and pepper to taste and a little olive oil. Toss together. • Couscous Blend cauliflower florets with a tbsp of pine nuts, some olive oil and salt and pepper until very fine. Mix with fresh corn, finely diced carrot, diced courgette, slices of sun-dried tomatoes, fresh peas, olive oil, lemon juice and extra salt and pepper to taste.

"   Overview By Stijn Buyst, editor of Use-it.be, Maps for Young Travellers in Belgium Twenty years ago, if you were walking around with a camera in Ghent, you were probably an art student. Today, the chances are you’re a tourist. Travellers have started to discover the pearl between Brussels and Bruges, and it’s now selfie time at the medieval Gravensteen Castle and in St Bavo’s Cathedral, with the famous altarpiece by Jan van Eyck.   Ghent locator map   One of the great things about this city (the third most populous in Belgium, with 250,000 inhabitants) is that it’s managing to reinvent itself at the edges. Parts of the city centre are now awash with rib joints and places offering the waterzooi chicken soup – the famous local speciality that nobody actually makes at home – but young people are starting up new bars and clubs in outer neighbourhoods such as Sint-Amandsberg, Gentbrugge and Muide. The municipality is supportive of the move outwards. What was once part of the harbour next to the decrepit Dampoort railway station will be redeveloped into an imaginative housing project in the next few years. But before people move in, the city has allowed the experimental artistic collective DOK to use the site for concerts, an improvised beach, and for drive-in cinema evenings during which a stunt car jumps through a caravan and a piano is thrown off a factory roof by way of an intermission. But hip developments aside, Ghent has retained its strong character, and a lot of the new spots are the same old places but with new, young owners. Café Fatima, next to the local art school, made a point of not removing any of the wallpaper when it took over from the couple serving daily dishes to its older regulars (the arcade racing game from the 1980s is still there as well). And when a new restaurant opens, it is often run by young chefs who prefer not to go after a Michelin star because of all the fuss that involves. They prefer to put their energy into no-nonsense menus with local ingredients (think pig) instead of investing in the right cutlery or pulling the chair out for customers when they arrive. But make no mistake, the quality at these Flemish foodie joints is high, and tables are sometimes fully booked for months on end at hot addresses like Vrijmoed or Oak. Where to go for art and design  By graphic designer Dries Deriemaeker, co-owner of print shop Topo Copy     An artwork by artistic collective DOK at the old harbour. Photograph: Linda Nylind     Related: Instagram snapshots: Ghent through the eyes of locals    DOK is a temporary cultural project in a large area where the old harbour and the border of the city flow into each other – empty warehouses, some slightly out-of-place apartment blocks and the odd second-hand car dealer. The scheme let us set up our first print shop there four years ago. Together with DOK residents, it promotes arts, culture and sports initiatives … It even had a row-in cinema, where everyone was watching Jaws on small boats in front of a big screen on the water. Democrazy takes care of the live music shows, and you can also find SECONDRoom Ghent there, a gallery concept where cutting edge contemporary artists show their work. Ghent has a vibrant street art scene, featuring the likes of Bué The Warrior and his joyous, colourful creatures, and the enigmatic Roa with his dark, black-and-white animals. Their work can be seen on walls all over town, often in collaboration with other less well-known painters. There’s one wall, at the junction of Sleepstraat, Grauwpoort and Rodelijvekensstraat, where almost all the Ghent street kings have made a big tableau together: Bué, my friend Topo ... all their styles blending in nicely. It’s a good spot to start your tour of Ghent street art.     Street art by the ‘enigmatic’ Roa on Tempelhof. Photograph: Linda Nylind    Another place not to miss is Blanco Gallery, a space inside the Nucleo studio complex. The gallery mounts excellent exhibitions, such as the recent The House Of Ruth Presents Janet, by my friend Ruud Rudy van Moorleghem. And Riot is a great shop, selling mostly artbooks, carefully selected by the owners Jurgen Maelfeyt and Caroline De Malsche. Subbacultcha, which organises concerts all over town, has its offices there as well. These days, art spaces are popping up outside the city centre. In the old harbour, for example, 019 (Dok-Noord 5L) is a really young and fresh place – an artist-run exhibition, work and concert space in an old welding factory. In summer, the old Grindbakken (grit containers) next to the water, will serve as the perfect background for Wastelands festival. Music/clubs scene By Joanna Iselé, an indie-folk composer/performer who performs as Imaginary Family     Raketkanon performing live. Photograph: Tom Roelofs/The Hell Gate/Corbis    A recent article in the Guardian highlighted the Belgian underground noise rock scene and Ghent band Raketkanon in particular. They are a great band, but there’s much more. The scene around local sludgemeisters Amen Ra is big as well, with lots of bands and projects centred around the Consouling Sounds label (see below). The scene in Ghent revolves around so many genres: the psychedelic hiphop beats by Dynnoo; local rock royalty-turned superstar DJs Soulwax/2 Many Deejays; my labelmates I Will I Swear; experimental drones by Mathieu Serruys and Hellvete, both operating closely to the long-running Kraak label. The latest sensation is Stuff, who have entered the Belgian mainstream with their crazy mix of jazz, hiphop, funk and electronics.     Unday Records’ Spotify picks   One reason why so much good music emerges from Ghent is that artists have plenty of opportunities to get out of their basements to perform. There are always free concerts happening around town – I used to go to concerts every night of the week. I only started playing guitar when I was 23, but I got my first show six months later. That’s probably the advantage of living in such a small town with so many stages. Just a couple of years later, I was playing my first record at Vooruit, which has always been a really important venue in Ghent. It’s a former socialist arts centre and meeting place, once combining a theatre with a supermarket and a big hall. In the 1980s a group of artists revived the building and it’s been the cultural heart of the city ever since. The last few years I’ve seen inspiring performances by Grouper, Bon Iver, Mulatu Astatke, Wilco, Caribou and Celestial Shore there. I even saw Joanna Newsom play a show there, and it only cost me €2.     The Vooruit arts centre. Photograph: Linda Nylind    Deeper down in the underground, new (temporary) places like 019, Gouvernement, In De Ruimte and Kerk Gent are popping up all the time, providing a stage for acts that are – if not as enigmatic – just as exciting. Nowadays, the scene is very much about crossovers between visual arts and music. Concerts come with exhibitions and vice-versa. It works both ways: the cover of my EP was drawn by a friend, Korneel Detailleur, and my clips were made by friends as well – Dries Bastiaensen and Ben Verschooris. That’s probably again due to the size of Ghent: staying in your own scene just doesn’t happen here, I guess. Where to eat/drink By Nele Buys, a food fanatic who, with husband Mike Keirsbilck, runs the record label Consouling Sounds and the record shop and coffee bar Consouling Store     A cafe by the market at Sint-Jacobs. Photograph: Linda Nylind    If you’re talking coffee in Ghent, Mokabon (Donkersteeg 37) is a classic. This small, popular coffee bar and roastery was founded in 1937. Coffee company De Draak goes back even further: it has been roasting handpicked beans since 1864. Coffee to De Draak is a serious matter, that’s why we use its products at Consouling – we like our coffee strong and straightforward.   Related: The best of Ghent, Belgium: readers' travel tips    If you want that extra barista touch, visit Gustaf (Sint-Jacobsnieuwstraat 45), where owner Xavier will happily discuss what you’ll be drinking with you. Drinking coffee becomes a personalised experience. If he thinks you’d like a slow coffee, he’ll make it in a vacuum coffee maker, and tell you all about the process while he works his magic. Ghent has the reputation of being Europe’s vegetarian capital. I’m not a vegetarian, but if we eat veggie, Komkommertijd (Reep 14) is our place of choice. It serves a variety of food in an all-you-can-eat buffet concept and has a cantina-style atmosphere. It’s very relaxed. As well as vegetarianism, ecological city farming is another thing that Ghent is pioneering in Belgium, and at Le Petit Botanique (Rodekoningstraat 12), every ingredient is sourced from one of the Ghent city farms.     Beef with cassis at the Publiek restaurant. Photograph: Linda Nylind    I’m an avid supporter of the weekly local markets. There are several organic farmers here, and they need our support. Every Friday, you’ll find a stall from De Volle Maan – a goat farm – on the Vrijdagmarkt market square. The farm’s yoghurt and the goat’s cheese with red onion are absolutely delicious. There are more organic food markets on the Groentenmarkt square (Friday, 7.30am-1pm) and at Sint-Pieters railway station (Sunday, 8am-1pm). There are new places popping up all the time. There’s a good buzz about L’Amuzette (Krommewal 2) and Ma en ik (Aannemersstraat 1A). But there are also a few classics that I just have to return to now and then. Het Lepelblad (Onderbergen 40) is my favourite for lunch, with a hearty kitchen and a homely feel. For dinner, Aperto Chiuso (Sleepstraat 82) is an Italian restaurant in a street full of Turkish pizzerias. I’ve been going there for 15 years, for freshly made pasta. I also adore De Superette (Guldenspoorstraat 29), where you can eat pizza with cauliflower and homemade bread. Publiek (Ham 39) is the new concept of chef Olly Ceulenaere, formerly the chef at highly rated Volta. It’s top of my bucket list.     Kitsch figurines at cafe and concept store L’Amuzette on Krommewal. Photograph: Linda Nylind    For a drink, I recommend the shop Drankhandel Geers (Ledergemstraat 7), in Oostakker (just outside of Ghent). If they don’t have what you are after, it probably doesn’t exist. Visitors staying in the city centre should drop by the city brewery Gruut (Grote Huidevettershoek 10), which produces excellent brews. Sustainable and organic Ghent By Nils Luyten, a human sciences researcher and upcycling enthusiast     Ghent has a strong sense of the need for sustainability – cycling is the preferred mode of transport. Photograph: Linda Nylind    Ghent is among Europe’s leading cities when it comes to locally driven green projects and sustainability.    Related: Bed and breaking news: Ghent’s newspaper hostel    Community gardens are popping up everywhere. De Site in the Rabot district is a really big one, built on a piece of land that in a few years will become a housing scheme. Another project is De Stadstuin (the city garden), near the Handelsdok canal. The plan here is to have local people farm their own chickens, grow potatoes, the lot. But of course we’re in Ghent, and we combine it with a bar. It’s just another example of how people in Ghent try to build communities around ecological projects.     Free-range sheep grazing the steep banks of the river.Photograph: isadarko/Instagram    One of my favourite community building projects is Leefstraten (living streets), in which a bunch of streets are being made traffic-free, all summer long. People create façade gardens and jeu de boules courts, and learn to live outside with their neighbours again. Roof Food is a new project that offers vegetarian meals like celeriac soup with roasted almonds, using biological vegetables, that are grown in small gardens on rooftops. Of course, the produce is being delivered by a bike messenger and the compost used is green waste from locals.

We asked our readers to share their favourite experiences and Instagram pictures of Ghent. These are just a few tips – see more here. Grab an arty cocktailJigger’s The Noble Drugstore is a cocktail bar in Ghent run by Olivier Jacobs, one of Belgium’s most talented mixologists. Jigger’s is all about taking the art and craft of cocktail making to perfection, and it is done in a lovely, cosy speakeasy-style bar. Olivier has a passion for foraging herbs and flowers, and he creates the most amazing infusions with them. Every week he has at least three new creations on the menu. His cocktails are not only works of art but are unique. A place not to be missed. Bart D’Hooge     Sphinx cinema and cafe.

It also has “happenings”, serves food and a large selection of cocktails, wines, coffees and Fairtrade drinks. All that in the middle of the historic centre of Ghent. Captainofnoella Party till the break of dawn in Club 69Club 69 is a small but fun and nicely-decorated place to spend your evening. In general it is associated with the cool and hipster people of the town. The music they play is varied: from hip-hop to minimal. My personal favourite is Mister Moustache – he just plays the funkiest tunes. Glenn Jones Walking by de Leie … and to Korenlei, Graslei, KraanleiOn a sunny day, I find nothing more relaxing than taking a walk next to de Leie river which runs alongside the city’s ancient buildings. You can then walk towards Korenlei, Graslei, Kraanlei, and end up near Baudelokaai and Portus Ganda. Another idea is to rent a boat (from Minerva near Coupure) and cruise along the Leie with some friends.

"Britain’s supermarkets are struggling to attract newly cash-rich consumers who are using their extra spending power to buy luxuries they denied themselves when incomes were being squeezed, according to the latest retailing health check. Food sales fell for the first time this year in July, according to the monthly British Retail Consortium-KPMG sales monitor, in a month when overall sales rose 2.2% on a year earlier. The report indicated that increasing wages and falling shop prices were giving consumers more disposable income, which they were spending on furniture, textiles, home accessories and footwear. Helen Dickinson, director general of the British Retail Consortium, said: “Despite being a slight slowdown compared with last month, today’s sales growth of 2.2% compared with this time last year reflects the continued hard work by retailers to tap into increasing consumer demand. “Consumers remain content to budget carefully on their necessary food outlay and spend that little bit more on purchases they have perhaps deferred.” The survey pinpointed an improving housing market and the beginning of school holidays as other reasons for the growth in retail activity. Sales of non-food goods online rose by 14.7%, compared with July 2014. David McCorquodale, head of retail at KPMG, said: “Retail sales remained positive in July as improved consumer confidence is slowly winding its way to the tills. “Looking ahead, retailers will be hoping more summer sunshine coupled with confirmation that interest rates will stay at 0.5% will keep consumer confidence riding high into August.” Bad weather during the second half of July was blamed for a tailing off in food and drink sales as consumers spent less on barbecues and picnics.

"     There are few multi-course tasting menus I genuinely look forward to: these onslaughts of dishes can be an endurance test when there’s only a dozen or so courses. But this is something else: a 200-course tasting menu, served over 24 hours yesterday, the “brainwave” of food mavericks Bompass and Parr, responsible also for jelly skyscrapers and alcoholic vapour clouds. Colour themed – Green Lunch, Pink Dinner – it included blue coronation chicken. Or Brown Blackout including chocolate, black garlic, burnt meat and milk jam. The above is from Red Party Time. Only two tickets were available for the full, terrifying shebang. Surrey entrepreneur Paul Davies was one of the lucky duo and live tweeted his whole experience. I don’t know whether you’d feel more bilious at the excess – tiny courses or not – or the two grand price tag.       This week’s GIMME: I adore the fried fruit doughnuts – donuts? – that Americans call “fritters”. The best I have tasted was an apple and cinnamon fritter from the farmers’ market on Third and Fairfax in Los Angeles. But these … oh my. Pineapple and coconut, thin fried dough, just warm from the fryer. As Lockhart chef Brad McDonald says here, “the unicorn of donuts”. It has even made me fancy a trip to something called Yazoo City.       Talking of excess, I’m agog at the Tipsy Bartender account, where amazing/appalling concoctions are whipped up someone called Skyy John. This Cookie Monster, featuring Nutella vodka, Oreos and melted white chocolate, is one of his more restrained creations. His bloody marys, typically groaning under a buffet of fried foodstuffs, would feed a normal human being for a week. There are more than two million subscribers on his YouTube channel: bad taste pays, folks.       All hate for takeaway coffee lids anyway – hey, your Starbucks can taste even more like plastic – but these are just nasty.

"People often ask if Moscow is a difficult place to live, and I tell them it’s great: exciting, vibrant, and with rapidly improving quality of life in recent years. There is one thing, however, that makes living in Russia a terrifying experience on a day-to-day basis; one pitfall of life that strikes terror into the heart of almost every expat. And no, it’s not the ruthless winter temperatures, nor is it the stifling political climate. It’s not even the lack of cheese on the shelves since Russia’s recent counter-sanctions were imposed. It’s dill. Dill is everywhere in Russia. It’s the national herb, smuggled on to every plate as if it were merely seasoning, rather than a ruthlessly aggressive flavour capable of sabotaging any dish with just a few of its spindly fronds. A Reuters investigation once found that the average Russian eats enough dill each year to fill a large suitcase. It’s one thing when dill blankets traditional Russian dishes like the emptied contents of a lawnmower bag, but quite another when it shows up on pizza, sushi, quiches: occasions when you naively hadn’t even thought to request a dill-free meal from the waiter. It is a sabotage apparently borne of a grotesque, atavistic culinary longing, like some deranged Brit on the Costa del Sol lacing a paella with brown sauce. I know what you’re thinking: gravadlax. Yes, yes. I am willing to accept that there may be a parallel reality in which the taste of smoked salmon is beautifully augmented by dill. But after all these years of dill, you see, I just can’t imagine it. Like a maltreated circus monkey, cowering in the corner every time it sees a human, however well-intentioned, I have been ruined by all the years of dill abuse. You wouldn’t foist a crisp glass of dry white wine on a recovering alcoholic, so leave me alone with your dilled smoked salmon, please. Russians themselves have become so immune to the taste that when the dill plague beneath their noses is pointed out, many react according to the first three stages of the Kübler-Ross scale for dealing with loss. First comes denial: “Dill? No, not really, I guess we use a bit, but it’s certainly not everywhere!” Next comes anger: “What is your problem, anyway, if you don’t like it, why don’t you leave Russia? And I know the kind of muck you eat in England, anyway, you make pies out of kidneys, you porridge-munching freaks!” Third comes bargaining: “OK, so we do eat a lot of dill, but we also eat parsley! And anyway, surely you agree that dill is great?” But dill is not great. And dill is everywhere. It comes in different forms, and it is hard to know what is worse: the vivacious, triffid-like full fronds which look as though they might spring from the plate and constrict fatefully around your throat, or the thinly chopped flecks, visually innocuous, but impossible to remove from the food. It’s not just the taste of dill that I find an affront, though that is bad enough. It’s the attitude. It ruins every hue of flavour it comes into contact with, clambering over all the other tastes and overpowering them with terrifying ease. Every herb has a personality: I think of rosemary and thyme as warm, generous friends, sitting by the fireplace in knitted jumpers and giving you relationship advice. Parsley is probably a fairly boring acquaintance who sits in the corner chattering away, telling long stories you can easily tune out of, while coriander is an exotic and sultry lover. Dill, however, is the culinary equivalent of Francis Begbie from Trainspotting. It has walked in, unleashed a string of obscenities, and glassed you in the face before you even knew what was happening. The only country that eats even more dill than Russia is Ukraine. I’ve even seen a dill fajita in Kiev. And the war has bought a surprising new twist to the dill story. The pro-Russia rebels nicknamed the Ukrainians “dill” (Ukraine and the Russian for dill, ukrop, share the same first three letters). The Ukrainians responded by reclaiming the name and setting up “dill battalions” of paramilitaries, who go into battle with dill logos sewn into their combat fatigues. Dill armies: it’s like something from a feverish dystopian nightmare I might have had a few years ago. But while Russia might be fighting Ukrainian “dill brigades” on the battlefield, the war against the actual herb is as hopeless as ever: dill sushi, dill hummus, dill pizzas and dill gazpacho are all recent sightings. True, central Moscow over the past decade has taken enormous culinary strides. Gone are many of the Soviet-style stolovaya cafes; in their place have sprung up hipster coffee bars and Brooklyn-style brunch joints. But even here, the dill monster is never far away. Take Brix, a delightful bistro near Patriarch’s Ponds – the most affluent and pleasant part of central Moscow, which serves grilled octopus and other exquisite Mediterranean treats. Oh, but hang on, what’s that greenish hue to the steak tartare? Yes, of course, it has been laced with enough dill to feed a family of 12. At Twins, a Moscow restaurant that is, in general, to be commended for its innovative use of local products and exciting haute cuisine Russe, the evil weed is an omnipresent menace. On a recent visit I selected an intriguing looking salad of new potatoes, grapefruit and omul, a fish from the waters of lake Baikal. “I’m not sure if it’s got dill on it, but if so, could I have it without dill, please,” I said when ordering. The waitress looked at me in disgust. “But dill is the whole point of the dish. No you can’t.” She was serious, and so I ordered something else.

"Australians are shunning fruits and vegetables while consuming three times the recommended daily allowance of junk food, a survey which asked more than 40,000 people about their eating habits has found. On average, Australians scored 61 points out of 100 for their diet quality, which was assessed using the the CSIRO Healthy Diet Score, a scientific survey which measures diet quality against the Australian dietary guidelines. The guidelines recommend adults eat two serves of fruit and five serves of vegetables every day, with half a cup of cooked vegetables, one cup of salad vegetables, one medium piece of fruit or one cup of diced fruit representing one serve. Fruit juices do not count. The survey found women scored higher than men on average – at 63 versus 57 points. Diet quality also improved with age, the survey found, with female responders aged over 70 scoring the highest (71) of any age category.  Renowned nutritionist, Dr Rosemary Stanton, said the findings from the CSIRO research was similar to results from other recent surveys.   Related: Childhood obesity levels due in part to discipline methods of parents – study    “We’re getting the results through from the latest Australian Health Survey, and that’s telling us 6.8% of Australians are eating the recommended amount of vegetables,” Stanton said. That was 39% less than in 1995, she said. “We’ve gone backwards on our vegetable consumption, while our fruit consumption hasn’t changed, with people still getting on average one serve per day,” she said. “People aren’t deliberately saying they won’t eat their vegetables, but the way they are eating has changed.” People no longer had time to prepare and cook evening meals, she said, while long commutes to and from work meant people often ate on the go. Quick and pre-packaged meals were less likely to be healthy, she said. “More women are also moving out of house and into the workforce, and no one is replacing them in the kitchen,” she said.  “Yet we still expect one person to do all the cooking and to be responsible for all of the meals, and helping out in the kitchen is seen as buying take-away. Most kids don’t know how to cook, and because most of the responsibility for food is still left to women, if she gets home tired after work and finds the kids have already fed themselves, she’s just happy she doesn’t have to cook.” An increasing number of single person households also meant people were loathe to prepare a whole meal for one, Stanton said.   Related: Obesity grips Australia: research shows 40% of adults are dangerously fat    There was a large variation in diet quality scores among occupations, the survey found, with the highest marks going to personal trainers (66.8), retirees (65.9), health care workers (64.3) and education professionals (62.3).  At the other end of the scale were construction workers (55.3), those in buying and purchasing (55.6), and operations and logistics workers(55.9). The unemployed also did not fare well (56.9).  Professor Manny Noakes, the CSIRO research director for nutrition and health, said discretionary or junk foods, including foods and drinks high in added sugar, refined starch, saturated fats and alcohol, while being low in essential nutrients, were being consumed frequently.  “What we’re finding is people are having larger portions of junk food, more often,” Noakes said.  “This type of food is no longer just an indulgence, it’s become mainstream and Australians are eating it each and every day.” To improve diet quality, people should eat more fresh food prepared from scratch, and eat smaller portions, she said.  “They also need to be more mindful of every bite they take by eating more slowly and consciously.”  See how you score at: www.csirodietscore.com",2015-08-10T07:05:40Z,"Australians' junk food intake soars but vegetables out of favour, CSIRO finds","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""4af789abea69325f152cc95f0ee0fc1042ac9938""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/4af789abea69325f152cc95f0ee0fc1042ac9938/0_166_5550_3332/1000.jpg"" alt=""Only 6.8% of Australians are eating the recommended amount of vegetables, according to nutritionist Dr Rosemary Stanton."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Only 6.8% of Australians are eating the recommended amount of vegetables, according to nutritionist Dr Rosemary Stanton.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: April Fonti/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>",54,"Survey of 40,000 people on their eating habits finds junk food has ‘become mainstream and Australians are eating it each and every day’ ",http://media.guim.co.uk/4af789abea69325f152cc95f0ee0fc1042ac9938/0_166_5550_3332/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/aug/10/australians-junk-food-intake-soars-but-vegetables-out-of-favour-csiro-finds,2,positive
"The vast majority of the world’s biggest food, beverage and tobacco companies are ignoring their largest climate impacts by failing to disclose emissions from agricultural production, according to a new CDP analysis.   Related: Big food is going green, but will consumers buy in?    When talking about the impacts of climate change, few risks are more visceral or tangible than those it poses to future food supply. From spikes in food prices to threats to the coffee industry, consumers are increasingly aware of the effects of rising global average temperatures.  For companies in the food, beverage and tobacco sectors, climate change presents a two-fold challenge: the industry is highly exposed to climate-related impacts, but is at the same time a major contributor to increasing global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions levels – particularly from agricultural production, which according to the IPCC causes 10-14% of global GHG emissions. These challenges are significant. KPMG has warned that inaction on climate change could threaten the financial viability of the food industry. The increase in unpredictable extreme weather events is already effecting agricultural productivity and food companies’ supply chains are being hit: the ongoing drought in California is estimated to have cost the agricultural sector more than $2bn to date. A growing number of companies are realising the risks. This year 92% of brands reporting to CDP – the global non-profit organisation that gathers data on environmental risk – noted risks from the physical impacts of climate change, up from 84% in 2012. Some companies are relating this to future financial outputs: Diageo projects that changes in temperature could have negative financial implications on its agricultural supply chain. This could force the company to spend up to $77m more in increased commodity costs and production disruption. But, despite these clear business risks, many companies are not yet investigating where their largest climate impacts may lie. The biggest source of food-related GHG emissions occurs before produce leaves the farm gate, in the agricultural production portion of producer’s supply chains. Yet only 22 of the 97 major food, beverage and tobacco brands that disclosed to CDP this year reported their indirect GHG emissions from agricultural production. In addition, the majority of emissions-reduction activities companies report carrying out are focused on their direct operations, rather than their supply chain, where the bigger opportunities and risks lie, confirming that companies should be moving their attention from their own operations to their agricultural supply chain. These risks are increasingly being realised by investors. Following a shareholder proposal set out by Green Century Capital Management and Oxfam America, one of the world’s largest food and beverage companies, General Mills, recently became the first in its sector to adopt long-term, ambitious targets to cut GHG emissions.  General Mills’ strategy includes carbon emissions from its own operations but also from its supply chain, including those from agricultural production. The company is ahead of its peers in recognising agricultural production as producing the largest amount of GHG’s of all its operations, bringing competitive advantage.   Related: Using big data could alert us to risks in the food supply chain    Data disclosed to CDP shows that major food producers that do take steps to address climate change through activities such as nutrient or manure management see multiple benefits, including financial savings. Over a third of food, beverage and tobacco companies report lower costs as a result of carrying out agricultural management practices with climate change benefit, either in their own farms or with suppliers.  Companies are also realising that they cannot do it alone. General Mills states that there is much to be achieved in pre-competitive collaboration across the industry when tackling emissions in agriculture. Supply chain collaboration is also providing positive feedback, with firms like SABMiller and Dairy Crest group undertaking knowledge sharing to improve fertiliser use. To truly ensure future resilience, food, beverage and tobacco companies must shift their focus from in-house emissions to those from agricultural production. While there are clear barriers to action, including the complexity of working with huge, global agricultural supply chains, signs of change are becoming more frequent.

"Madina Tsyuchuev had dozed off in the early hours of the evening, only to be woken a short while later by the smell of smoke, thick acrid clouds of which were seeping under the front door of her flat.  “My two girls were playing. The smoke was coming through the door,” the 24-year-old said. She rang her husband, Ibragin, who had been visiting a friend with their son. “I rushed home to find burning newspaper in the doorway, and was able to stamp it out with my feet,” the 27-year-old recalls. The family of five from Ingushetia – who have lived in the town of Brandenburg an der Havel for three years – appear to have become the latest victims of a wave of attacks on asylum-seekers in recent months across Germany. The violence follows a surge in asylum claims in the country this year, in particular from Syria and Eritrea, as well as Albania and countries of the former Yugoslavia, such as Kosovo. Police say whoever set fire to the Tsyuchuevs’ first-floor flat last weekend had taped over the fish-eye viewer on the door to prevent them being spotted – before soaking newspaper in fire-lighter fuel and placing it in front of the entrance.     A march supporting refugees in Dresden, eastern Germany, on Monday. Photograph: Oliver Killig/AP    Now they are living in fear of their lives, knowing that someone, probably in their neighbourhood, intended to kill them in what police have little doubt was a racially motivated attack. “Now I can hardly sleep, and I pace up and down the flat to make sure no one is trying to set fire to us,” Ibragin Tsyuchuev told the local newspaper.   Related: Teenage asylum seeker who confronted Merkel allowed to stay in Germany    In the first half of this year, 200 attacks on asylum-seekers’ homes have been recorded, up on 175 for the whole of last year, which in turn was a threefold increase on attacks in 2013. The real figure, say analysts, is probably far higher. Many refugees fail to report attacks, largely because they do not want to bring further attention to themselves.  Most of the attacks have been arson, focused on empty buildings, freshly renovated and awaiting a new group of refugees. They were often situated in small villages where foreign faces are unfamiliar and locals’ angst is high. Earlier this month, the search engine Google deleted a map that depicted the location of hundreds of refugee shelters across the country, entitled “No refugee camps in my neighbourhood”. Its authors had invited people to plot the specific location of new centres.  An increase in refugees coming to Germany, reaching numbers bigger than at any time since the second world war, has given rise to a heated public debate as villages, towns and cities are subject to a relatively new government policy that requires refugees to be distributed evenly across communities.  This year, about 180,000 have so far applied for asylum. The numbers are expected to rise to between 400,000 and 450,000. Last year, 202,000 applied – far more than in any other European country. Many local governments say they are struggling to find adequate space, as they turn empty sport halls, campsites and schools into shelters. Complaints that local budgets are under strain and resources such as translating services or transport facilities are extremely thin are widespread.  Some of the loudest opposition has come from eastern Germany, where a far lower percentage – about 4% – of inhabitants has a migrant background, compared with about 20% in western Germany. But even well-to-do regions such as Bavaria and Rhineland-Palatinate have experienced a significant rise in racially motivated attacks on asylum-seekers. These range from home-made firebombs placed in the corridor of an asylum-seekers’ home to physical assault. Much of the country’s attention has been on Freital, near Dresden, where asylum-seekers have become virtual prisoners in the hotel in which they have been housed, while locals outside shout abuse and threaten to burn the building down almost around the clock.  This week, a politician from the far-left Links party who protested against the Freital attacks awoke to the sound of his car exploding outside his house. Police suspect far-rightwing extremists were behind the incident.  Some analysts have played down the attacks, describing them as part of a “normalisation process” that Germany is undergoing as it gets used to the realities of ethnic diversity for the first time in its history – a necessity in the face of the pressing demographic challenge that comes from having one of the fastest-ageing populations in the world.      Refugees wait for registration after arriving Germany at the main station in Rosenheim on Tuesday. Photograph: Matthias Schrader/AP     Related: German leaders condemn xenophobia after Pegida protests    Others say that, while solidarity with refugees has never been so high in some areas, the rise in racist sentiment in others is getting dangerously out of control. The government has reacted by saying it will speed up the asylum process, with the aim of insuring that people who are not from countries considered unsafe – particularly those of former Yugoslavia – are sent home more quickly.  It has also announced plans to ease conditions in the labour market that until now have made it difficult or impossible for asylum-seekers to work. However, there are also plenty of warnings that resentment may be increased by opening up the job market if foreigners are perceived to be taking “German jobs”. While some politicians have sought to condemn the intolerance, such as President Joachim Gauck, who called the arson attacks “repulsive”, and warned that xenophobic attitudes had “hardened”, others, such as Horst Seehofer, the head of Bavaria’s conservative Christian Social Union party, have been accused of helping to fuel anti-foreigner feeling with repeated references to “en masse asylum abuse”.  “It’s extremely alarming,” said Josef Schuster, the president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, who accused Seehofer of provoking the situation.   Related: Germany presses for quota system for EU migrant distribution    Social media has been widely used to stoke xenophobia, with chatrooms replete with offensive references to “defiant swine” or “parasites” and suggesting the need for Germany to “turn the gas back on” in former Nazi concentration camps.  Much of the credit for the increasing social acceptability of venting anti-immigrant feeling has been given to Pegida, the anti-Islamic movement set up late last year by Lutz Bachmann, a publicist.  Thousands gathered for weekly Pegida rallies in Dresden and across Germany. Just as it looked as if Pegida was losing its edge, Bachmann – who, incidentally, lives in Freital – announced earlier this month that it would put up candidates across the country at the 2017 national election. There are fears that the wave of regular and often murderous attacks that took place on foreigners on an almost daily basis in the early years of German unification, between 1991 and 1993, may be about to be repeated. In the past 25 years, 75 people have been murdered in rightwing extremist attacks, the majority in the early 1990s.    Related: 'Flowers, candles and coffee were waiting for us': Syrians find warm welcome in Germany    Meanwhile, many other Germans have never been as engaged in welcoming foreigners. Reports abound of mayors climbing ladders to install satellite dishes for war refugees, or of local communities gathering food and clothing, retired teachers offering language lessons for free, and people opening their homes for foreigners to live with them.  “We are fully aware of the singularity of the situation in which we’ll continue to find ourselves in the coming years,” the council of Fürstenfeldbruck, a town in Bavaria that has taken in 1,600 refugees over the past few months, recently wrote to its 35,000 inhabitants. About 600 locals have signed up to volunteer their time for everything from teaching refugees German to organising computers and internet access. “We’re working flat out,” said a woman who helps asylum-seekers fill out their application forms. “And we have been for months. Nor is it going to ease up anytime soon.”  This article was amended on 30 July 2015 to correct a reference to Albania being a country of the former Yugoslavia.

"Tonnes of pork tossed into incinerators, truckloads of cheese bulldozed into the ground, and an orchard’s worth of apples buried in a shallow grave. The visuals of Russia’s stepped-up fight against sanctioned foodstuffs have been dramatic, and left many Russians wondering why so much is being destroyed in a country where millions of people live below the poverty line.  Moscow’s reciprocal measures against countries that sanctioned Russia over its actions in Ukraine have been in place for a year, but the new law stipulating the destruction of contraband shipments at the border came into force on Thursday. Importing fruit, vegetables, meat and cheeses from the EU and other countries that instituted sanctions against Russia is banned. Moscow says importers have tried to get round the ban by putting fake labels on produce, claiming it is made in Brazil, Belarus or another sanction-free country.      Bulldozer destroying illegally imported cheese in the Belgorod region. Photograph: Reuters    On the first day, newspaper RBK estimated that more than 300 tonnes of food was destroyed. Newsflashes came in from across the country as suspect food shipments were seized at the border and at wholesale markets: 650kg of Polish apples destroyed in Novosibirsk, Siberia; nine tonnes of carrots pulped just outside Moscow; a consignment of Irish pork detected at a warehouse in the town of Reutovo. On state television, a correspondent went live on air as a bulldozer just behind her ploughed into wheels of yellow “unidentified European cheese”.   Related: Russia introduces 'incinerate on site' law for banned EU food products    Many have pointed out that the sanctions appear to be a case of cutting off nose to spite face. The aim is to hurt western agricultural producers, and in some countries it has indeed had a major economic effect. Nevertheless, food prices have gone up in Russia as a result, and the latest move to destroy imports has created outcry, even among many who are loyal to the government. In a country where food queues were a way of life until two decades ago, there is a deep-set distaste at the spectacle of waste, and more than 300,000 people have signed a petition suggesting the food should be given to pensioners or others who are in need.  A television presenter on a local channel in the Siberian town of Nizhnevartovsk released a satirical video in which he set alight a piece of ham and some cheese from his local shop.              “I fully support the policy of our president and parliament and want to make my own small contribution to allowing Russia to rise from its knees,” he said, spraying paraffin on the food. “It’s a shame we don’t have mobile crematoria, that would be better, and then we could burn more ... Burn, you French filth. I hope they see this in Obama’s fascist Yankeeland.

"The World Bank’s view that we need to grow 50% more food by 2050 to feed 9 billion people, while finding ways to reduce carbon emissions from agriculture at the same time, ignores one very simple fact – we already grow enough food for 10 billion people. But a combination of storage losses after harvest, overconsumption and waste mean that some 800 million people in developing countries are malnourished. The storage losses mainly affect the global south: in 2011, the World Bank said:  “The world seems to have forgotten the importance of post-harvest food losses in the African grain sector.” Overconsumption and waste mainly affect the global north.    Related: We must quench the thirst of the 663 million people without safe water | Fleur Anderson    The challenge of feeding the world is not simply met through increases in production – this is precisely how the so-called green revolution created our current problems.  The answer lies in increasing the climate resilience of agriculture in ways that reverse the catastrophic environmental degradation of the last 50 years while also making production more efficient.  The green revolution that took place in the 1960s, increasing cereal production in developing countries, is credited with saving a billion lives. But today the environmental toll from this boom is all too evident. The statistics tell the story – 38% of the planet’s cropland is degraded, 11% of the irrigated area is salt contaminated, 90% of the biodiversity of the 20 main staple crops has been lost, nitrogen fertiliser produces 6% of greenhouse gases and its runoff creates 400 marine “dead zones” (areas where oxygen concentration is so low that animal life suffocates), and more than 350,000 people die every year from pesticide toxicity.  Research on planetary boundaries estimates that nitrogen fertiliser use needs to decline by 75% to avoid large-scale environmental impact of this kind. The focus on productivity over efficiency has meant that the amount of energy needed to grow the same quantity of food has increased by between one-quarter and one-third over the last 25 years. Even without climate change, conventional chemical agriculture is driving humanity towards a food-security cliff.   Related: African agriculture needs more of the green stuff, says farming alliance chief | Clár Ní Chonghaile and Alon Mwesigwa    A Christian Aid briefing paper argues that if we are to reverse this situation in the face of climate change, agriculture needs a transformative change in the way it addresses climate resilience.  Small-scale farmers and pastoralists, who manage 60% of agricultural land and produce 50% of the planet’s food, should be central to this agenda. Research to solve their problems should be guided by their priorities, and take place largely on their farms.  The kind of support farmers want often includes advice on soil management and testing, reliable climate forecasts, and development of their own seed and livestock breeding processes. The advice they get usually revolves around unaffordable chemical fertilisers and pesticides, while their ability to exchange and sell locally adapted crop seeds is threatened by corporate-inspired legislation promoting crop varieties developed in distant biotech labs.  Even the advice that is given often goes to the wrong person – small-scale women farmers manage up to 90% of staple food production but only 15% of agricultural advisers are women, and only 5% of advice reaches women. For farmers to invest in resilience, they need secure land tenure, especially when they participate in communal land-tenure systems. Land deals with largely foreign buyers have increased to 55m hectares. This not only dispossesses farmers but also undermines the confidence that others need to invest in measures to control land erosion, in trees and in other adaptations that pay off over several years.  Activities that degrade soils, forests and other vital catchment protection resources inevitably result in greater vulnerability downstream – through flood damage, increased exposure to cyclones and more intense drought, all of which affect food production. The good news is that by empowering farmers to develop climate resilient agriculture, it is possible to envisage the elimination of extreme hunger in 15 years. The conservation of resources and use of environment-enhancing approaches, such as conservation agriculture, agroforestry and integrated pest management, have been shown to yield more and deliver significantly better resilience to climate extremes than conventional, chemical agriculture. Such practices also reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition, increasing access to markets can turn agriculture into an engine that drives diversified, sustainable rural economies.  The World Bank’s call for climate-smart agriculture includes focusing on sustainable water use, countering gender inequality, and increased research .  It should also acknowledge the need for a truly three-dimensional approach to reversing the environmental degradation and climate change that “20th-century technology” has caused. Such an approach would include plans to strengthen the review of World Bank Environmental and Social Safeguards to ensure lending enables, rather than undermines, climate resilience for small-scale farmers and pastoralists in developing countries.

"The week the Chiltern Firehouse opened in central London, it was so full of famous people that something went wrong with the cosmic ratios: my fella and I sat between Kirsten Dunst and Sol Campbell. We were outnumbered. Gordon Ramsay was there, and I asked him what he thought of Nuno Mendes, the superstar chef. I was in search of mischief, some spurt of alpha-male jealousy. Ramsay, smarter than that, said: “He’s a chef’s chef. Fingertip control.” Mendes was already known on the foodie circuit for the Loft Project in east London, where he pioneered tasting menus and unearthed young talent. Viajante followed, in Bethnal Green town hall, where he got his first Michelin star. The Firehouse got him talked about at a different order of magnitude. It is still rammed with names, a year and a half in; paparazzi wait dutifully outside, and the flashing through the night makes it look, from the enchanting garden, as if you are surrounded by police helicopters. It is a great circus of a restaurant, distilling all the excitement and horror of 21st-century London – we’ve taken our fire-service infrastructure, sacked all the firefighters, and filled it with stars and front-of-house staff more beautiful than makes any human sense. God knows what will happen if there is ever a fire; hopefully the paparazzi will be able to help.   Related: Nuno Mendes’ small plates: sea bream, runner bean fritters and tomato salad    “Don’t call it a circus,” Mendes says, ruefully. I met him outside his new restaurant, Taberna do Mercado, in Spitalfields market, London. It was 9.30am, and I couldn’t figure out how he’d got so many stains on himself so early in the morning – at one point, I was idly checking his beard for crumbs while we chatted. “The combination of food and scene, that didn’t exist before,” he notes. “It seemed it was always about one or the other. If you go for the food, the scene is usually not as interesting. If you go for the scene, the food is …” he tails off. “Crap,” I supplied. The food in the Firehouse, by contrast, was brilliant, his caesar salad an instant global hit. When I first met Mendes in March, he was coy about Taberna, periodically muttering: “I may have some project that I might do …” The best chefs now remind me of poets in the Henrician court or painters in Renaissance Florence – they command huge cultural status, for good reasons, but they also rely on a patron, which in 2015 means a landlord or a proprietor. So there is always something they’re not allowed to say, which, being in possession of these great big spirits, makes them constantly want to say it, always on the edge of calling Anne Boleyn a slag or mourning the rapacity of the London landlord.  But we had only just met, and he was quite reserved, and we started talking about his caesar salad: how you make an emulsion out of a lettuce so that it tastes like a super-lettuce; how the changing mouthfeel makes you focus; textural interruptions, such as the crunch of a crouton that means you taste the whole thing over again in a different way; why the anchovies come from the Azores. There is a whole arc of history, empathy, conflict, sensory perception, chemistry and intellect heaped into this one salad. He talked about it for half an hour. “And hopefully,” he finished, “that makes it pretty tasty.”     Nuno Mendes at the Chiltern Firehouse. Photograph: Adrian Lourie/Eyevine    The food in Taberna do Mercado is different; it seems simple, but it’s not. It is poetic, complicated, nostalgic – he talks about creating dishes from “blurred memories”. “We, whether we like it or not, become ambassadors for our country … There are so many things being lost, little by little; there is lots of unemployment in Portugal, all these artisans losing their jobs. If you don’t act quickly on these things, it will be a sterile environment to go back to.” He pauses, looking a bit embarrassed. “I’m not even that patriotic.” When Mendes first arrived in London in 2008, he started with tasting menus at Bacchus, when Hoxton was still young and before young people turned foodie (I slagged it off at the time, said the myriad foams looked like the spit cuckoos do for their young. I just didn’t have a clue). “It lasted two years. It was doing OK by the end; the first three or four months were fucking rough,” he said. “But if Bacchus hadn’t closed, I wouldn’t have done the Loft, and that’s probably the most interesting project I’ve ever done.” Mendes left Portugal in his late teens to study marine biology in Miami, but he was already in love with cooking. His father refused to countenance a change of course unless he came back and worked on their farm in Portugal for a year. “I think he was really scared. I was his only son, even though he had step-sons, and I think he realised that if I went, I would never go back.” Although he studied in the US, the learning experience he always returns to is this year on the farm. I’ve never met a chef so soppy about animals: “I used to see little piggies when they’re this small, they’re adorable. I can’t look at suckling pig on a board. And with cows, it is a bit emotional, we removed them from their mothers. It was mainly a dairy farm, and I used to go and feed and care for them, and hang out with them. They’re really cool.” He can’t eat veal. He can barely eat pig. Mendes worked in many seminal restaurants – Jean-Georges Vongerichten, El Bulli – learning as much about what he didn’t want to do as what he did. “Jean-Georges had an open kitchen in Trump Tower and we did this amazing food. You looked into the dining room, and it was full of people who … this is what they ate every day. Amazing food was arriving at their table, and they were looking at their phones. I don’t want to cook for people like that. I wouldn’t want to go there for dinner. I want to cook for people who would be my friends.” He left the US after a constellation of unfortunate events – “a coyote ate my cat … I accidentally hit a cow … my dog …” he tailed off. (I didn’t want to know what happened to the dog.) He arrived at El Bulli in 2003, two days after his 30th birthday. “What I was looking for was to see that it existed and that it was possible to do a restaurant based on ideas rather than a business plan. Everywhere I’d worked, as creative as they were, was always a business. It was always a service. I wanted to see a place that said: ‘This is made to open your mind.’ And I saw that, but I also realised how late I was; most of the other guys there were in their early 20s.” Portugal is the great untold story of food, eclipsed by Spain and undervalued for its global impact (Goan food has a huge amount of common etymology). Its curiosities are relatively unknown; its custard tarts the main calling card. There are the gentler, sweeter cured hams from chestnut-reared pigs (“How can they call Iberian ham world-beating?”); croquettes of cuttlefish; alheira, king of the Portuguese sausage, made from game (“Taste that sourness; that’s fermentation, there’s no vinegar in there”); pink marlin; dried moray eel, a sea crop spreading from the Algarve to the Azores; tinned fish; langoustines; prawns; goose barnacles, crazy little creatures that you tug the skin off like a leg warmer; botollo sausage, made from the spine of a cow, which gave us the word “botulism”. At Taberna do Mercado, a lot of that is recreated, along with stews, mint hiding where you don’t expect it, cockle broth underneath runner bean fritters, “blurred memories from the way I ate in my childhood”. It is spectacular, but the emphasis is not on spectacle. “I want it to be a little portal into Portugal,” says Mendes. Five more chef’s chefs Thomasina Miers on René Redzepi, chef and co-owner, Noma He has done such extraordinary things for Scandinavian food. I love following the progress of his restaurant touring the world, first in Japan and now in Australia. I love his unquenchable love of ingredients, and I love how he has just opened up and told everyone exactly how much he earns. As with many of the world’s best chefs, he embodies this wonderful dichotomy of wanting to push food to the very limit of what you can do with it while loving absolute simplicity. Raymond Blanc on Ollie Dabbous, chef and owner, Dabbous, London Ollie is young and full of ideas and creativity. Seasonality is central to his cuisine, which I think is so important. He grows his own fresh herbs – it’s what all of us should be doing at home, too. He is truly innovative with his cooking: I like that he is pushing gastronomic boundaries. Allegra McEvedy on April Bloomfield, chef and co-owner, the Spotted Pig and the Breslin, NYC So many chefs these days force things, with too much going on, too many unusual ingredients just to be different. But with April, there is no tension on the plate, just a beautiful simplicity. It’s a joy to eat. And when you meet her, she’s exactly the same, down to earth, relaxed; she doesn’t care for fame. She just wants to make good food and make people happy. Asma Khan on Cyrus Rustom Todiwala, chef proprietor, Café Spice Namasté Much like Vivek Singh, Cyrus is keeping alive the roots of authentic, traditional Indian cuisine in his food, traditions that even in India are dying out. His Parsee heritage is a beautiful amalgamation of Indian and Iranian influences. I’ve loved it from the first time I ate at his Khaadraas Club – I was stunned to be eating dishes, here in London, that I hadn’t tasted since I was a child eating at friends’ houses in India.

"Misshapen potatoes. Lumpy lemons. A butternut squash that’s curved in all the wrong places. These are the rejects of the food chain – the produce that rarely makes it to consumers, weeded out for cosmetic reasons. However, a project in Spain is embracing these rejects, diverting them from the bin and, instead, putting them on plates.  “We created this project to give dignity to those using leftover produce,” says Mireia Barba, one of the three co-founders of Barcelona-based Espigoladors. For the past year, the project has been in touch with farmers across the north-east region of Catalonia, offering to send volunteers to pick produce that has been left in the fields for reasons of aesthetics, ripeness or low sales.     Unusual shaped vegetables picked by Espigoladors. Photograph: Espigoladors    The volunteers are recruited through social services, often people who are out of work or struggling to make ends meet. Espigoladors sends groups of 10-20 people to farms where they spend a few hours collecting leftover produce. They can take home as much as they like. The remaining produce is taken to community kitchens. “People email us and tell us that they’re out of work and in a vulnerable situation. They don’t want to go to a church or a food bank – they come to us,” says Barba. About 30 producers and distributors have signed up to the Espigoladors project. They call with as little as 24 hours’ notice when they have leftovers to be harvested. These donations usually start at about 200kg, says Barba.     Volunteers pick fruit on a farm. Photograph: Espigoladors    Rebeca Segura called Espigoladors last month. Her group, Desos, a cooperative that runs organic farms in Sant Boi de Llobregat, near Barcelona, had been left with about 50kg of radishes after a client rejected them. “They weren’t round and perfect,” says Segura. Initially, Desos had tried to get rid of the radishes on their own. “We handed them out to our family, friends, anyone who would take them,” Segura says. “But, eventually, you get to a point when everyone you know has their fridge filled and it seems like there’s no alternative but to let them go to waste.”      Radishes collected by volunteers. Photograph: Espigoladors    If the team from Espigoladors hadn’t come to pick the radishes, they would have been left in the ground, says Segura, echoing a conundrum familiar to many producers who point to cost and effort as barriers to donating leftover produce. “It would take hours of work to harvest them. Probably, we wouldn’t have even bothered, we would have just left them in the ground to rot.”  In Spain, about 7.7 million tonnes of produce – roughly 163kg per person – are thrown away each year, says Barba. In its first year, Espigoladors has managed to recover about 70,000kg of produce.  Central to the ethos of Espigoladors is a desire to build a bridge between producers, who say they have no alternative to the bin for leftover produce, and the many families in Spain who are reeling from the economic crisis.      Potatoes shaped like ducklings picked by volunteers in Catalonia. Photograph: Espigoladors    The project was inspired by a friend’s tale of nightly rummaging through the bin of a grocery store. “She was unemployed and had two children and this store was throwing out produce that consumers didn’t want, even though it was in perfect condition,” says Barba. Job creation is another aim. A small percentage of the produce collected is set aside to be made into soups, jams and juices, which are sold under the brand Es Im-perfect (it’s imperfect).      A strawberry unlikely to make it on to a supermarket shelf.    “The name is a declaration of our intention,” says Barba. “It’s a brand that aims to provide value to leftover, imperfect and ugly food.” Es Im-perfect employs three people and has plans to expand operations in the coming year. Its products are sold across Catalonia, with profits being funnelled back into Espigoladors to cover expenses such as transportation costs.  Underpinning much of the work of Espigoladors is the push to detangle aesthetics from the idea of what is edible. Barba and her team often hold workshops for various groups and children, passing around photos of three-headed lemons and potatoes shaped like hearts. “Children find it hilarious,” she says. “They’ve never seen anything like it, because all of the products in the supermarket look the same.”  The project operates around Barcelona, but is expanding to other areas of Catalonia.

"Food insecurity is a “hidden crisis” in Australia, welfare groups have warned, with increasing numbers of people unable to afford enough food for themselves or their families. Foodbank Australia, an organisation that provides food for those in need, said demand had increased by 8% in the most recent financial year, compared with the previous year. About 516,000 Australians now rely on Foodbank’s services each month.  The not-for-profit network said more than 60,000 Australians seeking food relief were turned away each month due to a lack of resources. “Hunger really is a hidden crisis in Australia,” said Jason Hincks, chief executive of Foodbank Australia. “We are seeing a significant gap emerge between demand and supply, which is an issue for government and for the rest of us.” Improved food manufacturing processes, which led to a reduction in excess food to be given to those in need, welfare policies and rising living costs were driving the increase in the number of people going hungry, Hincks said. “Financial circumstances are the number one driver,” he said. “If there’s an unexpected expense, such as a medical bill or the car breaks down, people struggle to put food on the table. “We are seeing a greater trend towards a hungry working poor, especially families and single mothers.” The Salvation Army, one of the agencies that distributes food, said that while homeless people made up a large proportion of the people they dealt with, they were also beginning to help those with stable jobs and homes. The Salvation Army’s 2015 economic social impact survey found 10% of Australians said they could not afford to buy enough food, with this proportion on the rise. The study found that more than half the people the Salvation Army dealt with had gone without meals due to financial hardship.  “We are seeing more and more people who have never been to the Salvos before, people who in the past have helped the Salvos but now need our help,” said Bruce Redman, a Salvation Army spokesman. “There’s a lot of stress on people with very low paid jobs and on welfare and the dollar isn’t stretching. If something unexpected happens and the money has gone, what do they do? They sit around without heating and lighting and do without meals.” Redman said the lack of affordable housing and the welfare support available were key. “If you’re on Newstart it’s an absolute disaster because it is such a small amount of money,” he said. “What are you supposed to buy with that? How can you feed your children?” Curtin University has started a research project assessing whether the food charity sector is meeting rising demand. Dr Christina Pollard, of the university’s school of public health, said Australia’s social safety net was “eroding”, contributing to food insecurity. “The government should acknowledge and report on food insecurity as they do in other countries,” she said. “People are going without food and the problem is quite severe. We need really strong leadership and a national food plan that involves everyone working together on this as a priority.” Pollard said there had been no strong advocacy around food insecurity in Australia, unlike the high-profile issue of food stamps in the US and the increase in the number of food banks in the UK. Foodbank Australia has launched a new initiative, called Food Fight, with a number of food brands to encourage donations for people going hungry. Community organisations are striving to raise awareness of homelessness as part of Homelessness Prevention Week. According to Homelessness Australia, on any given night about 105,000 people, or one in 200 Australians, will have no place to call home. The peak body said the federal government had damaged homelessness services, such as the provision of accommodation and meals, by defunding advocacy groups and attempting to shift responsibility onto the states and territories.  The federal department of social services has been contacted for comment.",2015-08-04T06:18:20Z,"Food insecurity and hunger a 'hidden crisis' in Australia, says Foodbank CEO","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""381cafac3ea4e757a2243ab804dc031cbb50101c""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/381cafac3ea4e757a2243ab804dc031cbb50101c/176_67_2880_1730/1000.jpg"" alt=""More and more Australians are accessing welfare relief services with a new Salvation Army survey revealing up to 10% of the population can not afford to buy enough food.

"It’s a one-time chicken shed on a Welsh caravan park, with half-wood, half-breeze block walls and a corrugated iron roof. Not quite the type of place you’d expect to be bracketed with the culinary elite such as the Ledbury and Le Gavroche perhaps. But turn off onto a quiet patch of countryside in the south of Anglesey and you’ll find the surprise addition to this year’s prestigious Good Food Guide – the Marram Grass Cafe. “There’s something in the fact that it shouldn’t work. It’s a shed in the middle of nowhere,” says Liam Barrie, who runs the restaurant with his brother, Ellis, when asked for the secret behind its success. “What right do we have to be providing good food?” The brothers set up the cafe in 2010 on the caravan site established by their parents, partially as a payback to them by Ellis after he went travelling. There had been plans to turn the building into a toilet block for the caravan site, but they were abandoned as the restaurant became increasingly popular. At lunchtime on the day after its inclusion in the Good Food Guide, the cafe was packed out with customers including day-trippers from around the region as well as, of course, caravaners who can look forward daily to something that bit more special than a supermarket meal heated up on their gas hobs. The restaurant puts an emphasis on local produce, with a menu that ranges from carrot, almond and tea-soaked raisin soup through to locally caught sea bass with foraged Anglesey samphire, as well as other mains based around local oysters, lobster with herb and lemon crust, and rump steak with local chard and sweetcorn. A typical dessert is Eton mess made from local fruits and home-made marshmallow.  Among contented customers were Chris Faircliffe and his wife, Emily, both NHS workers from Holywell who were visiting Anglesey and decided to take a detour to the cafe with their children after hearing about its success on the radio. “It’s just a really beautiful, simple idea ... isn’t it?” he said, tucking into a signature plate of fish and chips. “The fact that it’s all incredibly fresh really just adds to it. I’d happily travel back here again.” Customers have already been making trips from as far away as London to sample the food, with the beautiful north Wales countryside a bonus. On a clear day customers can view the mountains of Snowdonia to one side, and gaze over green and golden pastures on the other.  For the brothers, connecting with the area was a priority from the start, although they were familiar with it from a young age. “Our parents slowly brainwashed us into being excited about caravan sites and when they bought the site I had just graduated as a surveyor, so I came to help them set it up in 2009,” says Ellis, 25. Meanwhile Liam, 27, who was in Australia after cutting his teeth in the food industry working at Filini restaurant in the Radisson hotel in Liverpool, came back to develop the cafe. “It was really hard to find local produce back then,” said Ellis. “We were only 19 and 21 then, so two young Scouse lads knocking on farmers’ doors saying ... can we have some of your produce? ... It took a while for us to establish strong links, but as it happens, we’re also now seeing the emergence of a strong food group on the island.  “For us to be in the Good Food Guide is incredible. I mean, there are people like Gordon Ramsay there, people we would have looked up to as inspiration for food when we were kids and saw him on television.” Today, the Marram is a 40-cover restaurant that has grown from serving 30 diners a week to up to 2,000 covers. Around 100 people come through its tiny front doors at lunchtime to squeeze behind tables and into nooks around a bar area inside the “shed”. For Elizabeth Carter, the Good Food Guide editor, it is “an extraordinary find”. The cooking had demonstrated “ambition and skill”, offering “a simple recipe for success that not many manage to get so right”. She added: “When one of the guide’s longest-serving inspectors tipped us off about a restaurant in a shed on a campsite, our curiosity was piqued. And what an extraordinary find Marram Grass Cafe turned out to be. “The low building with its corrugated iron roof may channel scout hut and air-raid shelter in equal measure, but the interior charms and the cooking show ambition and skill.” For now, the brothers are enjoying their newfound culinary fame, but plans are already in motion for expansion after the family recently acquired 14 acres of land right across the road from the site. “The plan is to have a smallholding so we can start supplying our own produce. We also want to develop it in terms of an edible woodland-type set-up, opening up into little kitchen gardens and have an educational spine through it as well,” added Ellis. The tin-roofed hut is here to stay, however. “People have asked us over the years if we are going to get rid of it. Are we going to make it bigger? But what’s important is the charm of the place. The simplicity is the key to it.”",2015-08-29T07:00:09Z,Hut cuisine: shed cafe enters the Good Food Guide,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""f669da37026bb08defe9c25edc77a7bf75cc89e3""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/f669da37026bb08defe9c25edc77a7bf75cc89e3/0_0_3500_2099/1000.jpg"" alt=""Scousers dishing it out: Liam (right) and Ellis Barrie outside the Marram Grass."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Scousers dishing it out: Liam (right) and Ellis Barrie outside the Marram Grass.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Iain Watts/Caters News/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>",65,"The surprise arrival in this year’s Good Food Guide is sited on a caravan park, complete with corrugated iron roof ",http://media.guim.co.uk/f669da37026bb08defe9c25edc77a7bf75cc89e3/0_0_3500_2099/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/29/a-shed-load-of-top-cuisine-in-anglesey-food-wales,1,positive
"Just mentioning genetic modification (GM) creates division. The anti-GM lobby sees red mist, the pro-GM lobby seemingly wants to roll out the red carpet and others see GM as a red herring, a distraction from other (more easily acceptable) solutions to our huge food challenges. My reaction? To be honest, my heart sinks. I’m fed up with arguments that GM is necessary to give us enough food in the future, but also tired with those who dismiss the technologies out of hand.  So why get embroiled? Firstly, as one of the most contentious subjects in food and farming, it’s exactly the sort of debate we at the Food Ethics Council should engage in. Secondly, it is time to reframe the debate – one that needs to be about the problems GM is seeking to solve, not about the technology in isolation as happened once again with the recent Scottish ban on GM crops.   Related: Monsanto's new $1bn herbicide shows our bias towards hi-tech solutions    I find the “we need to embrace GM to feed the world” argument spurious. It assumes that producing more food is the answer. I’m not anti-innovation and technology. I believe that in the west we need to change our diets (more plants, less meat), our business models, our structures of governance and our consumerist habits. We need to empower smallholder farmers and citizens around the world. I recognise there is room to improve yields – nutrient supply per hectare not just output per hectare. We also need to improve resilience and cut food losses. But that doesn’t equate to a rubber stamp for all GM technologies. Technologies move on – just look at mobile phones. We need to debate the extent to which they are fit for purpose and the conditions in which they can be used. A technology can’t itself be good or evil – the real issue is in how it is applied. I don’t think we should embrace the suite of GM technologies, because that implies unquestioningly accepting them with open arms. But – as with any technology – I believe we should be cautiously open-minded.    The vested interests at play mean the evidence we see from the research community isn’t always objective. So instead of allowing “experts” to determine the best course of action, why not ask the public? We could demand independent, objective evidence and then introduce people’s panels to assess different options and determine the best course of action.   Related: Why NGOs can't be trusted on GMOs    “Do we need GM?” is a polarising and leading question. The challenge for policymakers and researchers is to ask different questions and not stick to the same old debates. Arguably there has been too much focus on GM, meaning other options have been under-resourced or even ignored, when there are many other ways to build better food systems for all. We should instead consider the full range of technological and non-technological options that exist, and the relative long-term benefits and risks of each. For any technology, in a given context, we should ask who it empowers, who it disempowers and who owns it. And we should understand how it promotes diversity, resilience and fairness. Rather than get stuck on whether GM is right or wrong, we need to get back to the most important question of how to solve our major food challenges: the need to ensure food security, environmentally sustainable food production and consumption, and food policies that promote public health – all in socially just ways.",2015-08-28T13:44:00Z,GM technology isn't good or evil - it's what we do with it that counts,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""1d08b949b7560c63a76932646c08157be8f1bb52""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/28/1440751395461/024529ef-ef5a-4537-b022-255223f76259-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Forget about asking if GM is good or bad, we need to get back to the question of how to solve our major food challenges, says Dan Crossley."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Forget about asking if GM is good or bad, we need to get back to the question of how to solve our major food challenges, says Dan Crossley.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",66,"Rather than debating genetically modified food, we should be discussing the problems it is intended to solve",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/28/1440751395897/024529ef-ef5a-4537-b022-255223f76259-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/aug/28/debating-gm-crops-distraction-from-food-crisis,2,negative

"If there’s one thing that Terry Wogan has mastered after so many years of broadcasting, it’s the art of conversation. There’s a warmth and knowingness in his on-air style that made him the perfect person to host the UK’s annual Eurovision humiliation for years, or wake Radio 2’s TOGs up, host his BBC chat show, dole out Blankety Blank cheque books and pens, or get people to cough up for Children in Need; he’s more than earned his “national treasure” status. On the radio it’s the kind of delivery that lets you hear the twinkle in his eye; in person he’s easy company, a gent who holds the lift doors open. As he says in the introduction to his new BBC2 show Terry and Mason’s Great Food Trip: “It’s taken 50 years in broadcasting, but I’ve finally cracked it – a chance to meander around the country, see the sights, meet the people and eat and drink.” The format couldn’t be simpler. London cabbie turned presenter Mason McQueen (who you may have seen driving around Mumbai in A Cabbie Abroad) keeps his eyes on the road, while Wogan sits in the back as they retrace the journey taken by American expat writer Samuel Chamberlain for his 1963 book British Bouquet: An Epicurean Tour of Britain. Although Wogan claims “nobody was exactly beating a path to my door” before he accepted the series (“I’m a forgotten face, Terry no-mates!”), it’s a great fit, basically giving him free rein to reel off anecdotes, eat and have a good time. It’s like Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s freewheeling culinary sitcom The Trip, minus the swearing and the passive-aggressive Roger Moore impressions.  McQueen keeps up his end of the chat, lobbing back a stream of gags from the driving seat (“Look at this Tel, it’s like the south of France, hope you’ve got your Speedos”) as Wogan gently rips into Chamberlain’s overwrought descriptions (“He was a bit of a snob wasn’t he?”).     I'm waiting for a tirade of abuse from people saying, ""Is this what I pay my licence fee for?""    So what was it about the chance to eat their way around the country that first attracted them to the programme? “It just seemed a really interesting idea…” Wogan deadpans, “this was before I’d read the book of course. If I’d read the book first, I’d never have done it. It’s a terrible, really boring book! I’m waiting for a tirade of abuse from people saying, ‘Is this what I pay my licence fee for – to see Terry Wogan stuffing his face?!’” It’s the meandering that Wogan does best, gently musing on his surroundings and dipping into his endless well of anecdotes. Mention their trip to Chester, for example, and he’s off: “I had a horse in Chester – Wogan’s Wager – he didn’t do all that well, but I’d gone up to Chester to see the bloody thing run, and as it came into the finishing straight the commentator said [fakes RP accent] “and last, at the moment, is Wagan’s Wo-ger…” But I was glad to get back to Chester and walk the walls…”     Terry Wogan makes chocolates in Dorchester in Terry and Mason’s Great Food Trip. Photograph: BBC/Curve Media Ltd    What would Chamberlain have made of the duo following in his food-prints? “He wouldn’t have made head nor tail of it,” reckons McQueen. “He was a traditional all-American guy and it was all roasts then.” He’d be surprised by the growth in fast food and variety on offer now, says Wogan.“We had a Japanese meal in Winchester, a Thai meal in Harrogate, pulled-pork sandwiches in Canterbury, we had sausages all over the place…” “We’ve always got room for a sausage roll,” McQueen cuts in. “I thought if I squeeze another sausage I’ll go mad…” Although they’d never worked together before, McQueen and Wogan make an easygoing double act. “A lot of the programmes are about my trying to put him off jellied eels,” Wogan claims.  Did they ever think of switching places in the cab? McQueen puts his foot down. “Somebody had the bright idea that Terry should drive – I said no…” Wogan is not having it: “I’m a bloody good driver you know, no man can be accused of being a bad driver – it’s like being accused of not being any good in bed!” Across the country they had a good reaction – except perhaps from the woman in Winchester who “burst into tears” at the sight of him. “In general people appeared to be pleased to see us except for a woman in Marlow who came up to me and said, ‘They had to tell me who you were.’”    People think they know you because you've been in their homes for years. You can't reject that and say, ""Oh clear off""    Does Wogan still find it odd to be mobbed by strangers? “As long as it’s friendly you must cope with it – these are people who think they know you because you’ve been in their homes, in my case for years, you can’t reject that, you can’t turn round and say, ‘Oh clear off’ – even people who think you’re Tony Blackburn, you’ve still got to be nice to them.” Given his long career at the corporation I wonder if Wogan is worried about the future of the BBC? “Since I wasn’t invited by the eclectic group who gave their opinion, I’m not prepared to give one,” he says. “No, no.” His voice drops to a whisper - the charm turned off just for a second. I feel like I’ve snapped one of his Blankety Blank microphones in half. “Not in view of what’s transpired, it’s all been a little too furious.” Not just the master of chat then, but also a master of knowing when not to talk. • Terry and Mason’s Great Food Trip starts on 31 August on BBC2, at 6.30pm",2015-08-27T06:00:20Z,Terry Wogan: 'If I squeeze another sausage I'll go mad',"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""58719b5eed87ed7093e3ba96135705e31e42c55f""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440593601276/89859d98-1f5a-43a8-afc8-c20b28a6e5fd-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Mason McQueen, left, and Terry Wogan on their Great Food Trip."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Mason McQueen, left, and Terry Wogan on their Great Food Trip.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: BBC/Curve Media Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>",68,"It’s a tough job, but someone has to do it.

"     According to trade mag the Grocer’s Twitter feed, West Cork Distillers have forged an unholy partnership with the Pogues to create a blended whiskey with a high malt content, branded with the name of the notorious Irish folk-rockers.

Brilliant.        Among the crimes currently being committed in the name of burgers – burgers sandwiched in doughnuts, or between slabs of fried chicken, or in nests of fried noodles or huge beef tomatoes – this one ranks among the worst. This evil-looking creature is notable not for its offputting green demeanour (the sage?) but for the fact that those ain’t buns, baby.

"A new study led by Professor Charles Spence, the Oxford University gastrophysicist making waves in the food industry, has proven beyond doubt that making something look good makes it effectively taste better too. What’s interesting, is that where previous studies have focused on sophisticated dishes – sautéed chicken breast with a fines herbes sauce, brown rice pilaf and sautéed green beans with toasted almonds – and Michelin-style plating – arranging a 17-component salad to look like a Kandinsky abstraction – here the plates in question featured a simple garden salad (leaves and cucumber with other unspecified ingredients), and steak and chips.      A plate of sirloin steak cut to show the inner colour of the meat. Photograph: Daniel Bendjy/Getty Images    Spence’s team found that even with such basic dishes, thoughtful presentation meant diners found the food more flavourful: cutting the fillet horizontally, thereby showing the inner colour of the meat, or serving the cucumber thinly sliced on top of the other salad ingredients, made both dishes considerably more appetising – and appear to be more expensive. In the case of the salad, diners were willing to spend three times more for that decorative assemblage, £3.85, as opposed to £1.35 for the unprepared version. While it seems patently obvious that if you’re going to buy a salad, you’d rather it actually be prepared, it is noteworthy that that preparation is valued twice as high as the raw ingredients. When it comes to food, it seems we are willing to pay quite a bit for attentive labour. As Amy Fleming writes, about the Kandinsky salad, other people’s effort tastes good. On the other hand, too much fuss is offputting: as Jay Rayner noted last month, fine dining is on the wane. When eating out, for the most part, we want good food, but little faff.      A salad with cucumber thinly sliced on top of the other ingredients. Photograph: Jasmin Awad/Getty Images/EyeEm    But what of the food we prepare ourselves? Does the same degree of effort go into what we put on our own plates? Fleming, at the end of her piece, resolves to make sure it does, especially when hurriedly dishing up dinner for her kids: “Food plonked on to the plate willy-nilly makes them deeply suspicious,” she writes, “whereas a pleasing pattern or an artful arrangement gets things off on a fine footing.”  Asking friends shows it can go the other way though. One, Jessica Stanley, a writer and mother of two, is suspicious of anything too slick or too fussy in a restaurant: “No smears of puree or carefully angled rectangles of fish. I’m alert to too many ingredients on one plate, an extra sauce or jelly or dust or edible flower that says the chef isn’t confident in his dish.” So, she says, she’d never do that in her own food. “If I know that the ingredients are good I don’t mind how a dish is served at home: if the lamb’s organic and time has been taken, splat a big serving of shepherd’s pie on the centre of my plate.” The one concession she’ll make to food styling, she says, is to wipe the edge of the plate clean of smears and splashes.  When it comes to her toddler, how food is presented is guided by this one question: “How can I get her to eat a balanced diet without any trauma?” Stanley’s strategy is simple: a variety of colours and textures, a choice of spoon and bowl so the child has some say in the matter, and new things served next to old faves. Or indeed not served up at all. “The easiest way to get her to eat something is not to serve it at all,” she says, “just snack on it myself so she steals it from me.” And lastly, “if we’re eating as a family I flatter her by serving her exactly the same meal on the same plates that the adults use. I can immediately see her sit up straighter and eat in a more grown up way.”  This is a fairly accurate description of how I approach feeding a toddler too. A selection of lots of little bits, the more variegated, the better. And I definitely enjoy making it all look pleasing. It’s the tiny things on top of other things that work particularly well: capers or other pickles, chopped herbs or nuts, black sesame seeds on white rice, a crumbling of feta on red, red tomatoes. But, actually, variety, contrast and attention to detail are guiding principles in all the food I make and serve. It’s instinctive: I want the food I give to someone – to anyone – to look beautiful.     Variety, contrast and attention to detail … a vegan salad with spelt wheat, sesame, tofu, red bell pepper, snow peas and carrots. Photograph: Getty Images/Westend61    I ask my mother and my aunt Mary about their approach, and it’s the same. For Mary, it’s obvious: you want to eat something that is fresh, cooked just right, arranged with purpose. “It doesn’t have to be meaty, just exciting,” she maintains, “with different tastes and textures in each mouthful. There’s nothing worse than a grey, boiled meal.” But it’s the ingredients first and foremost that matter: if it’s fresh, it’ll be beautiful. Also, presentation starts with preparation: it’s starts with how you peel your Brussels sprouts and cut a cross in the bottom before you cook them (or don’t).  For another friend, Su Card, mother and grandmother, presentation and quality of ingredients have to go hand in hand – neither are sufficient on their own. And she’s not easily fooled: “I’m not sure that looking good makes it taste better. It certainly raises expectations and excitement, to see if it tastes as good as it looks, and when it doesn’t it’s a disappointment. I also think I come from a socio-economic background that doesn’t splurge out on eating out that much, and I quite resent paying for looks over taste. I don’t mind paying for something that has been good value and delicious but not for something that looks better than it tasted … I’d rather someone cooked with love and care even with cheap ingredients than expensive ones thrown on a plate – to me, that’s just a comment on what they can afford.”  So making a plate look lovely is important – not pretty or fancy. Card says she’ll definitely think about how she chops a carrot or slices a courgette, never plumping for the bog-standard discs of yore. And not being a great baker, she’ll do cakes with big lumps of apple, “fruit that can afford to be crusty around the edges, nothing that needs to rise evenly or be finely iced, no meringues that have to look like clouds on a plate.”  Photography in cookbooks, and on social media, Instagram in particular, certainly serves as a source of inspiration, even for those who just cook for themselves or their families. Stanley says she recently started serving “bowls of disaggregated bits of salad or vegetable or a protein over a grain. That’s Instagram’s fault.” The whole #avotoast explosion has as much to do with how good smashed or sliced avocado on toasted sourdough looks as it does with the fruit’s supposed superfood health benefits, especially when topped with a sprinkling of chilli flakes or a soft-boiled egg. But making food look good only so that you can post a photo of it online is, for me, a surefire way to take the joy out of cooking: it becomes a job to be done, no longer a moment to savour.  Perhaps the key to a good-looking plate lies in the love at its core. Symmetry Breakfast, the Instagram account that most accurately embodies the art of patterned plating, started in 2013, when, as the website coyly states, “when Mark moved in with Michael” and the latter started making breakfast for the former, laying out the two meals in perfect symmetry. My mother summed it up perfectly when talking about my granny: “We grew up poor, just as she had done. But Granny had a way of making us feel like each of us got something special. She never just threw things on a plate. It always looked light and fresh, never stodgy or heavy.” Whether it’s a Michelin-starred chef or my grandmother, when the cook prepares and dishes up something made with care and attention, the results are destined to be delicious.

"The seventh season of a resurgent MasterChef Australia is coming to an end on Monday night, and I’m reminded it has been five years since I won the second season. A lot has changed in that half-decade. I’m no longer working as a lawyer, for one. These days I cook, I write books, I make TV shows, I travel and eat, and generally I spend an awful lot of time thinking about food. Here’s a few things I’ve learned. Cooking is a basic life skill As a cookbook writer I must have been told a thousand times by people that they “don’t have time to cook”, and I’m always baffled by it. Australians spend on average around four hours a day watching TV and surfing the internet. We all have time to cook. Cooking is a basic life skill – like riding a bike or brushing your teeth. There’s no better way to improve your quality of life than by learning to cook well.  I’m not a chef, and I don’t want to be MasterChef and other shows like it are fantastic entertainment, but it should be obvious to everyone that if you want to be a chef then going on telly isn’t the way to do it. I have huge respect for chefs, but good food and good cooking isn’t the exclusive domain of Ramsay-esque bluster, or Blumenthal-ian wizardry. Home cooking is not second-best to restaurant food – they’re two different things. I just love feeding my family, and helping other people do the same.   Related: Adam Liaw: bring back the three course meal    Simple is best I cook far more simply today than I did five years ago, and it comes down to one obvious truth: there is no correlation between how difficult something is to make, and how good it tastes. Ingredients are fantastic just as they are, and it’s the cook’s job to get them ready for the table without getting in the way of their natural flavour. I can honestly say I rarely spend more than 20 minutes making dinner each night, and I think I’m a better cook for it. Seasoning is the most important part of making food taste good A few weeks ago I wrote about seasoning, but it’s such an important point it deserves repeating. Seasoning and flavouring are two different things. Chefs often talk about seasoning as the correct level of salt in a dish, but in reality seasoning is balancing just five things: salt, sweet, sour, bitter and umami. Flavouring, on the other hand, is adding new flavours to a dish. Years ago I focused a lot on flavour combinations, worrying whether basil and apple went together, or if I could combine duck with tomato.  These days I hardly ever think about those things. Good seasoning is the reason why at fancy restaurants you can see strange combinations of ingredients that just seem to work together. And it’s the secret to making delicious food at home, too. Food is fun We all tend to take food (and television) a bit too seriously. The winner and other contestants from this season will have seen food reach the most artificially stressful, combative and difficult point it will ever reach in their lives. When the dust settles it’s time to remember that cooking is easy, and food is fun. Keep that in mind, and I wish every one of them wild success, happy cooking, and full bellies for years to come.",2015-07-27T06:54:59Z,Adam Liaw: five lessons I've learned since winning MasterChef,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""72f8665cf9cc5413ba86cb9c7888786b4aa38874""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/27/1437974567308/421ae336-c976-4e9e-a861-d172819e3b85-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Adam Liaw"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Adam Liaw says he has learned a lot about himself and cooking since MasterChef.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Destination Flavour, SBS Australia</span> </figcaption> </figure>",73,"With the MasterChef finale upon us, the season two winner reflects on how the TV show changed his life (he’s given up law for a start) and what it has taught him<br>",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/27/1437974567675/30886249-e0fc-467e-99f8-5c5e779517c9-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2015/jul/27/adam-liaw-five-lessons-ive-learned-since-winning-masterchef,8,positive
"A study of an Alaska polar bear population in summer concludes the bear’s biology will not help stave off starvation in the face of global warming.   The study of southern Beaufort Sea polar bears by university, federal and private researchers over three years concludes they have no special ability to minimise energy loss during increasing periods of fasting brought on by climate warming, less sea ice and fewer hunting days.  The research rejects the idea that polar bears can avoid harmful declines in body condition in a sort of “walking hibernation,” as suggested by 1970s research.  Co-author, Steve Amstrup, a retired US Geological Survey polar bear researcher now affiliated with Montana-based Polar Bears International, said the “walking hibernation” theory arose with observations of bears at Canada’s Hudson Bay.   The paper published on Thursday in the journal Science instead concludes that polar bears have no such ability to conserve energy and react like all other mammals when faced with limited food.  “We haven’t known until now whether bears really reduce their metabolism in summer, which, if they did, may have offered a limited buffer from some of the negative effects of ice loss,” said lead author John Whiteman of the University of Wyoming.  Fasting is a way of life for many animals. For polar bears, fasting can last eight months. Their main prey is ringed seals. Hunting is most successful from April to July when seals use sea ice for rearing pups and molting.   In months following, ringed seals spend most of their time in water. Some polar bears retreat to land, where feeding opportunities are limited, or stay on sea ice that in recent years has retreated far north of the shallow, biologically abundant outer continental shelf.  Using helicopters launched from a Coast Guard icebreaker, researchers sampled bears on summer sea ice.  “This paper gives us the first solid understanding of polar bear metabolism in summer, especially out on the sea ice over deep water far from shore, where bears have never been sampled before,” Whiteman said.  The study found that activity and temperature patterns recorded for polar bears in summer were not comparable to patterns for hibernating bears in winter dens. The patterns were typical of food-deprived mammals rather than hibernating mammals, Amstrup said.  Karyn Rode, US Geological Survey research wildlife biologist in Anchorage who was part of a polar bear fasting study published in 2012, said the new study confirms that “walking hibernation” does not accurately describe polar bears’ energetic status in the summer.  “It’s definitely a different line of evidence that further supports that they can’t conserve energy when they’re fasting,” Rode said. Additional studies are coming out, but scientists say it is already clear what needs to be done.  “We already know the answer to the question, ‘What do we need to do to save polar bears from extinction?” Amstrup said. “All of the studies in the world won’t help us there. If we don’t deal with greenhouse gas emissions, those of us who have been studying polar bears for our whole lives will be nothing more than polar bear historians.” ",2015-07-17T09:17:19Z,Polar bears can't cope with food loss by entering hibernation-like state – study,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""55ec05297bca9d34178a1fde6d05eb52917ed69c""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/17/1437124359901/4804576f-54eb-4aa5-b9ad-6d28995758a4-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""A polar bear in the Beaufort Sea region of Alaska.

"Pop-up dinners seem to be popping up everywhere – in secret, en masse, in the dark and even in the sky. In Crown Heights, Brooklyn, I tried a Provençal pop-up dinner. Once a month, Betty Kalin of Betty Brooklyn Catering Co invites about 20 guests to enjoy a multi-course meal inspired by her favorite parts of the world. Last month it was southern Italy, and next month the American south. Her small storefront and kitchen is squeezed between a Pentecostal church and an injury lawyer’s office. As I stepped inside, the sunny office space looked like a Provençal picnic, minus a Cézanne painting backdrop: sprigs of lavender, fresh fruit and checkered napkins decorated the two farmhouse style dinner tables.      The second course featured a carrot and chickpea dish accompanied by ratatouille. Photograph: Stylish Hip Weddings    A waitress greeted guests with an anise-infused lemonade. I was the first one there, so I plopped down in my assigned seat and waited for the other guests to arrive – among them my husband Bastien, who grew up in the small town Salon-de-Provence. He moved to New York in December, and Betty’s dinner is probably as close to Provence he will get this year. Perhaps the hardest part of my husband’s immigration to the US, after the inane visa process, has been dinner time. Americans “eat with the hens”, he likes to say. Well, his loss, because while he arrived late to the dinner, I ate his appetiser – a single shrimp wrapped in phyllo dough and drizzled with pesto sauce. Then, a multi-dish second course: braised rabbit in a red wine sauce; “loup de mer”, a Mediterranean seabass; ratatouille; a carrot and chickpea dish; and fettuccine in a roquefort sauce with artichoke hearts.     Braised rabbit in red wine sauce was among the evening’s highlights. Photograph: Stylish Hip Weddings    It was the course I’d been waiting for. In five years spent with Bastien, I’ve successfully dodged eating horse, frog legs, andouille sausage and a few other delicacies I’m still not sure how to pronounce. But here, in my very own neighborhood, I tried rabbit.  Verdict: I helped myself to seconds. (We were told later by a representative from Local Bushel, which sourced a lot of the ingredients, that the meat was “fresh”. The rabbits had been slaughtered on Monday, he said. It was Wednesday.) The family-style setting gave way to easy conversation. Or maybe it was the wine, which was paired with each course. One of the young women seated at our table told us the recipe for hummus. Then she gave us a lesson in kebabs. Her parents had immigrated to New York from Syria several decades ago, she explained. And in case there was any doubt, she told us: “I’m basically the queen the of kebab.”     The cheese course. Photograph: Stylish Hip Weddings    We learned that everyone else at the table had been born and raised in New York. Bastien had so many questions. “So when you say ‘the city’,” my husband asked, “do you mean Manhattan or do you mean New York?” Manhattan, they all agreed. “Do you say you’re from Brooklyn or New York?” he asked the Kebab Queen. The New Yorkers giggled. Her accent answered the question. “Brooklyn,” she told him. “Definitely Brooklyn.”  Then she gave him some real talk. “When you live here, you’ve got to know a guy for everything,” she advised him, as the waiters brought around a honey saffron cake that was syrupy, rich and spongy. After dinner, I asked Betty why she had started the pop-up dinner series. As a caterer, she said, she spends most of her time preparing meals that mean the most to her clients, but the pop-up dinner series allows her to experiment with her own favorite foods. “All of these dinners are a little bit personal,” she said, “which is the fun part – that they can be individual and unique and fun and expressive for me as a chef.” As the guests filed out, we said goodbye to our fellow diners, and thanked the host for what Bastien and I agreed was a truly enjoyable evening escape to Provence. But as soon as we stepped outside, the blare of car horns and screeching of tires snapped us right back to Brooklyn.

"What happened to the classic three course meal? Not so long ago it was the gold standard found everywhere from fancy restaurants to the weeknight dinner table. It’s time to bring it back in from the cold.  The three course meal dates back to ninth century Spain, when Persian polymath Ziryab no doubt infuriated the Emirati court in Cordoba by insisting meals be served as a soup, followed by a main dish, finishing with a sweet dessert. His fastidiousness aside, the idea certainly caught on, and it held near-complete dominance over how the western world ate for more than a thousand years. In the last few decades the three course meal has fallen on hard times. We began to obsess over convenience at home, and the idea of cooking more than one thing a day became the stuff of nightmares. Restaurants wanting to stand out from the crowd started serving a bewildering array of degustations, mini-degustations, small plates, big plates, sharing plates and tasting plates. It’s getting confusing, and now whenever a waiter approaches my table to “explain how the menu works” I let out a silent scream, the curmudgeon in me longing for a simpler time. It’s understandable why restaurants have distanced themselves from the tradition – new menu structures allow chefs to control ordering, reduce waste and increase how much the customer spends. And at home our the mindset has changed so that we now want to spend as little of our lives cooking as possible, leaving us more time to watch other people cooking on the telly. It almost seems like the three course meal is doomed, relegated to once-in-a-blue-moon Saturday night dinner parties, and hokey tourist traps in Paris’s sixth arrondissement. Even the darlings of the neo-bistrot movement, touted as the resurgence of French cuisine, seem to have left behind the prix fixe holy trinity of entree-plat-dessert. The likes of Le Chateaubriand, Frenchie and Bones all opt for four or five course menus in search of that little extra je ne sais quoi. I don’t think wanting three courses is simple nostalgia. There’s something very human about it. Playwrights and dramatists have followed the three-act structure of setup, confrontation and resolution for thousands of years, so perfect is its clarity of message. A three course meal tells a story with a beginning, a middle and an end, and when done well it resonates like the perfect pitch of a tuning fork. I rarely finish a good three-courser feeling anything other than comfortably satisfied. All is not lost. One champion of the three-course meal is London’s Dinner by Heston, Blumenthal’s throwback concept to the glory days of British food, such as they were, and it’s heartening to see how eagerly the dining public have taken to it.  It’s soared up world restaurant rankings on the back of rave reviews and now outranks his flagship, the Fat Duck. Another Dinner outpost will open in Melbourne in the coming months.  Sydney’s latest big opening, Peter Gilmore’s Bennelong at the Sydney Opera House, is distinguished by its three course a la carte offering giving theatre-goers the pleasure of a fine meal while finishing in time to see the curtain come up. Dinner’s runaway success could indicate that the three-course meal is not yet dead. We might still love the idea of sitting down to a meal with familiar structure, where food is served to please you rather than dazzle you.      Chefs Heston Blumenthal and Ashley Palmer-Watts, whose Dinner by Heston Blumenthal restaurant was the only UK one to make it into the top 10 of the World’s 50 Best Restaurants list this year. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/Murdo MacLeod    Whether at a nice restaurant, down the pub or in your own kitchen, it would be a great shame if the institution of the three-course meal were to quietly slip away undefended. It’s time to bring it back. Adam’s three tips for making three course meals at home: 1. Cook in reverse If I’m making a three course meal at home, I’ll start by making a dessert that can be served straight from the fridge at room temperature, then a main course that can hold in the oven or on the stove. Finally I’ll prepare the entree just before it’s time to eat. It’s all about planning. 2. Spread it out If you’re going to eat three courses instead of one, you need to reduce the portion size for each course. If you’re used to eating a 300g steak for a one course dinner, try half that size for a three course main. I work on a 30:50:20 rule – 30% of the meal for the entree, 50% for the main course and 20% for dessert. 3. Learn the basics With a few basics up your sleeve, putting together three dishes is dead easy. Just add a meringue, and a few berries and cream become an Eton mess. A simple short pastry can turn anything in your fridge into a pie or tart. A vinaigrette dresses a few vegetables up as a perfect entree. The basics are what make ordinary ingredients a meal.",2015-07-17T04:34:37Z,Adam Liaw: bring back the three course meal,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""3b46bca3501ec922b1d3f4caaa4ff28d9e6b8dea""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/17/1437098481131/11cd22ca-cbe4-421e-a9c2-f46a128d6e41-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Forget small plates – Adam Liaw is a fan of the three-course meal."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Forget small plates – Adam Liaw is a fan of the three-course meal.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Destination Flavour, SBS Australia/Supplied.</span> </figcaption> </figure>",76,"Between sharing plates at restaurants and one-dish dinners at home, in the last few decades the three-course meal has disappeared.

"Jalapeño – the very word raises the corners of my mouth to a pleasant smile. It wasn’t always this way, in fact years ago I’d be asking for an extra napkin after eating a vindaloo, for the beads of sweat on my forehead. People change, our palates evolve and mine seems to have been drawn to jalapeño. Maybe my taste buds are just worn out with age and require a bit of heat to get excited. What ever that case be, it’s jalapeño that I have affection for, so much so that I grow approximately 20kg of it every year. That’s a lot of chilli. I make many products with these little peppers, with much of it ending up in sauces like the fiery salsa picante, or the spicy harissa. I smoke them, which transforms jalapeño into chipotle, and ends up being added to cooking or turned into killer sauces. I also dry the jalapeño or roast it dry, then blitz it to make a hot chilli powder. It’s one less spice I need to buy.     Chillies grown in Rohan’s hothouse. Photograph: Rohan Anderson/Supplied.    In Australia there isn’t much variety in commercial chilli, which I reckon is a bit slack. The sheer variety in chilli is phenomenal, but it’s just not part of our culinary culture.  I have taken to a few other varieties like the birds eye, fire and habenaro, but it’s the ever reliable jalapeño that I keep returning to. For years I’ve experimented with differing varietals trying to find what matched the higher altitude, short summer climate. I was barking up the wrong tree with this experimentation. It wasn’t until a few summers ago when I built a poly tunnel was I able to successfully grow chillies.    Related: Alys Fowler: chillies    A poly tunnel – also known as hothouse – is a steel frame covered in special grade plastic that is often used by commercial florists and veg growers to capture the sun’s rays and create a controlled warm environment. Now, no longer did I have to be content with green chilli, for my poly tunnel extended the growing season a month either end of the summer growing period. The sunlight gets trapped in the plastic covered poly tunnel and heats up the soil and maintains a controlled growing environment without the need for a heater. As the days cool off the outside garden and soil cools too, and this would make growing a little harder for the chilli plants. But in the poly tunnel the warmth is trapped and the temperature remain consistent, replicating the environmental conditions used to grow chilli. The system works so well that right in the middle of winter I still have a few plants with fresh chilli hanging from them. Not only can I enjoy the heat and tang of a bottle of salsa picante in the middle of winter, but I can now add thinly sliced jalapeño to dress my scrambled eggs in the morning.  In my previous life, if I desired jalapeño on my eggs during winter, I would have gone to a supermarket and bought them from the fresh produce section. These supermarket chilli’s would have been grown in a warm climate (well over a thousand kilometres away) and trucked to my local supermarket, or they would have been grown in a massive commercial hothouse, heated by a diesel generator adding yet more carbon emissions to our already challenged atmosphere. I know the plastic tunnel of mine is not perfect, or free of environmental impact, but it gives me many years of service and grows a large portion of our food which makes sense to me.   Related: Hottest chillies in the world: the Scoville scale – in pictures    Over summer we get baskets of tomato, eggplant, zucchini, capsicum and all the chillies. In winter it houses broccoli, kale, peas, spinach, carrots ... you name it. Its functionality and reliability as a food producer is phenomenal. We end up knowing exactly what we’re eating and how it was grown. The best feature of growing my jalapeño crop in my poly tunnel is that I always seem to have a little more crop than I need, which means the excess ends up as the ultimate bartering commodity. I’ve recently swapped a basket of my chilli for smoked ham hock, bacon, toulouse sausage and chorizo. Spring isn’t really that far away, even though it did snow here last week. But give it a month of two and I’ll be found propagating another round of jalapeño seeds that will grow over the coming summer and bring us culinary joy all through next winter.

"Sydney’s Rockpool has been named best restaurant in the country in the Gourmet Traveller awards. Head judge Pat Nourse praised the flagship restaurant run by veteran chef Neil Perry. “You hear people telling you that fine dining is dead with the same predictable frequency that you hear the novel is dead, but just as people writing great books, people keep producing great restaurants. It’s a grown up restaurant, it’s an exciting restaurant. It doesn’t insult insult your intelligence.” Rockpool’s mains are around the $40-$50 mark and chefs work with local produce, giving it an Asian twist (for instance – roasted blue swimmer crab with fried garlic and fragrant udon noodles). A tasting menu of nine courses is $185. Nourse, who spent seven months (with a team of 60 reviewers) trying restaurants and bars around the country, praised Rockpool’s sommeliers and the “elegant, incredible dining room”. “The staff have a command of their material. Restaurant-craft for them is something innate – it’s in their bones. It’s not hospitality that’s been cribbed from the internet and practised in front of the mirror: you know as soon you walk through the door that it’s the real deal. You get the sense that everything will be taken care of.” Although there are Rockpool franchises in Melbourne and Perth, the Sydney original is the gold standard, says Nourse.   Related: Sepia in Sydney restaurant review – the decor is serious, the food is amazing    “Rockpool has always been Neil Perry’s baby. There is the clear sense that this is his flagship. It’s the creative engine that powers all his businesses – and a real creative engine for modern Australian dining, as a whole. You have this dialogue between Neil Perry, a veteran who still picks up the knives, and the head chef, a young gun called Phil Wood who knows how to push the boat out.” Australia’s Bar of the Year is Brisbane’s heritage listed space, The Gresham, while Regional Restaurant of the Year is Byron Bay newcomer Three Blue Ducks – who also operate a cafe in Bronte. Nourse said Melbourne had fewer “dynamic restaurant openings than Sydney this year” but Victoria scored gongs with Vanessa Crichton of Rosetta taking out Maître d’ of the Year, and Raffaele Mastrovincenzo from Kappo winning Sommelier of the Year. Dan Hunter, of Brae in country Victoria, took out the top spot in the peer-voted Chef of the Year award. New Restaurant of the Year award went to the newly refurbished Bennelong, at the Opera House. Billy Kwong, also in Sydney, won Wine List of the Year.   Related: Why the block of ice in your cocktail glass is as important as the booze you choose    Lennox Hastie, a chef who cooks only with fire at his Surry Hills restaurant, Firedoor, was named Best New Talent. “We’ve stretched the definition of ‘new’ a bit in Best New Talent; he’s been cooking for 15 years professionally, and has worked with some of the most famous chefs in Europe before finally opening a restaurant of his own here in Australia. The way these guys cook is like nothing else. It’s not big flavours, it’s not what this guy does. He uses smoke and fire with precision and delicacy. He’s cooking with pans made of mesh. He’s cooking over coals in what looks like a strainer.”     Some of Australia’s top chefs enjoy a feed at Wednesday night’s Gourmet Traveller awards.

"It was time to undo my belt and beg forgiveness from my dentist. For the second year running, Sydney’s Shangri La hotel hosted Sweet Street, a four-hour extravaganza of sugar-coated, dusted, glazed, frosted dessert tastings. Some of Australia’s finest pastry chefs, confectioners and chocolatiers flew into town this month to put their most popular and kookiest creations on display. Guardian Australia took a trip into this Willy Wonka-esque sugar kingdom to discover the best, most innovative desserts available in Australia right now. Unmissable: Black Star’s Strawberry watermelon cake with rose-scented cream     Black Star’s strawberry watermelon cake. Photograph: Alexandra Spring/Instagram    About five years ago, Christopher Thé from Sydney’s Black Star Pastry came up with a novel idea for a wedding cake: layers of almond cake, whipped cream, a strip of fresh watermelon, pistachios, more cream, strawberries and dusted with edible rose petals. Despite the flamboyance of the ingredients, the cake was light, fresh and delicious and quickly became the cafe’s signature dish. Delicious! There was a long line to sample the classic cake.    Weird but it works: Andy Bowdy’s Nutella and cherry pie The foodie world is abuzz with the news that the pastry chef at the Sydney hipster eatery Hartsyard, Andy Bowdy, has gone out on his own with Andy Bowdy Pastry, an online bespoke cake service that will ship around Australia. Promised offerings include chocolate fudge cake with Milo mousse and salted caramel with Snickers wedding cakes.      One of Andy Bowdy’s chocolate fudge wedding cakes.    I tried the deep-fried Nutella and cherry pies which were yummier than they sound. The warm golden pastry pillows, dusted with cinnamon sugar, split open to reveal oozing Nutella and rich, ripe, dark cherries. Wonderful to eat – but could be a nightmare to ship.  The latest trend: eclectic eclairs from Cacao     Cacoa’s range of six original eclairs including the smores eclaire and the bacon and egg eclair.    According to chef Tim Clark, eclairs are the new macarons, and his Melbourne patisserie Cacoa has an eclair-only store to demonstrate just how much fun can be had by mixing up the flavour, texture and composition of the classic chocolate pastry.  For Sweet Street, Clark displayed six bizarre types that I had never encountered. There was an eclair with miso caramel custard, an eclair with raspberry creme and a chocolate “Astro boy” decal, a cereal eclair with cornflake cereal custard, an eclair with passionfruit and a milk chocolate Pokemon decal, and a bacon and egg eclair with egg custard and a strip of crispy maple bacon. I opt for the eclair with biscuit crackers and dark chocolate creme topped with a layer of charred marshmallow, toasted to order. In one bite, textures combine: it’s crunchy and creamy and sticky and chewy all at once. Confusing but somehow delicious.   Too cute to eat: LuxBite Kuma     LuxBite’s too cute to eat Kuma and curious Blue Calpis dessert.    Melbourne’s LuxBite specialises in desserts that combine Asian influences with French dessert techniques. There are two stores: the original LuxBite, which does macarons and cakes, and T by LuxBite, which specialises in tarts.  Bernard Chu and Yen Yee brought their four most popular desserts to the Sweet Street event. There was the blue Calpis, which is a white chocolate sponge with blueberry jelly and cream made from Japanese soft drink Calpis; the oversized raspberry endless love macaron, with lychee ganache and rose cream and a dark chocolate slice with a hazelnut crust and salted caramel dubbed epic chocolate cravings. My pick? The very kawaii-looking kuma, a teddybear-faced cookie cake with layers of strawberry, banana and chocolate milkshake mousse topped with caramel. Again, for all its decadence, it was surprisingly light, creamy and even a little citrusy.  Over the top: Adriano Zumbo’s Cereal Killer Zumbaron     Adriano Zumbo’s lime and twisties zumbarons. Photograph: supplied    Australia’s dessert king ever since he introduced the nation to the croquembouche (an eclair tower), Adriano Zumbo now has seven stores across Australia and an ever-changing menu of wacky “zumbarons” with flavours such as Vegemite and salted butter caramel on toast.  His palate-bewildering offerings include a salted butter popcorn choc top chouxmaca and a lime and cheese twisties zumbaron. Feeling positively Mr Creosote-esque (or Augustus Gloop) at this point, I opted for the cereal killer zumbarons – a pinky mauve macaron “coated in cornflakes, frootloops, Nutri-Grain and rice bubbles”. I felt like I was going to burst but I pushed on. With this many flavours at play, my palate could register only a wave of sickly sweetness and the realisation that it was time to lick my spoon one last time and bow out for the night.

"       Looks like the Big Sweary Gordon empire has finally got hip to the vegetables in “soil” trend from, ooh, about five years ago. But rather than coming up with a playful way to present real veg, his team at Southwark’s Union Street Cafe have gone their own merry way with this extraordinary dessert: carrot ice-cream in a cone covered with orange chocolate, with chocolate-biscuit crumb and topped with candied celery. Bugs Bunny would be proud.         This intricate, extraordinary dish from Noma suggests that anyone dismissing René Redzepi’s extraordinary creativity is on a hiding to nothing. There’s a marvellously full description in the caption; note especially the base painted with “a paste made from Danish wood ants”. He may be influential, but the ant thing continues to leave me cold.         I love that Wimpy still exists. And I love that, with its foray into social meeja, it’s trying to get all hep to the scene, daddio. Sadly, it’s not quite got Twitter, bless it. Of course, it could be a fiendishly clever marketing ploy to underscore its iconic retro status … Nah, maybe not.         Love it when this happens. Which reminds me, too, of the legendary Chihuahua muffin Tumblr sensation.         New York’s Rice to Riches, a cafe dedicated to selling only rice pudding (for example, “hazelnut chocolate bear hug” rice pudding and “the end of rum to raisin” rice pudding). Its honesty is refreshing and it works – I now need to know what the shitty flavours are. (Although I’m guessing “man-made mascarpone”, “‘Oreo’-gasm” and “take me to tiramisu” might be contenders.)

"After my daughter was born, the first outing we took was to our local pub in Bethnal Green. It became a regular thing: there was something about the smell of beer and sound of cockneys swearing that calmed her. Nearly four years old now, she still loves these trips and even plays “going to the pub” with her friends. I’m expecting a call from the social services any day. We go at least once a week but it seems that we’re not going enough. You may have noticed a current advertising campaign for beer. You’d think that the British would need this like they need reminding to breathe or eat crisps, but beer sales have been falling for years now. The advert is directed by Michael Winterbottom, but those hoping for something as funny as The Trip or even an 80s lager commercial will be disappointed. It’s village-fete Britain on display, with a diverse cross-section of the population drinking out of an array of glassware. The message that they’re trying to get across is that beer isn’t just drunk out of pint glasses while shouting at the footie; it’s a civilised beverage to be enjoyed with food. The slogan is “there’s a beer for that”. You can see what they’re getting at. You’d never guess it from scaremongering stories in newspapers, but the British are drinking less of everything. The traditional boozer’s boozer, like our East End local, may well be doomed. Nowadays, the only sort of pubs that seem to be thriving are ones that concentrate on food. In the past, the British would have drunk beer at the table. Walter Besant, a novelist and historian, wrote in 1880: “Beer was universally taken at dinner; even at great dinner parties some of the guests would call for beer.” But now wine has usurped our native brew. Matching specific wines with food has become all the rage, so why not try a similar thing with beer? Recently I had a pint of strong Brakspear Triple III with some Colston Bassett stilton. The hoppiness and sweetness of the beer beautifully ameliorated the saltiness of the cheese. The pairing enabled me to drink more beer and eat more cheese. I had some pretty odd dreams that night. I’m not completely sold, though. One of the things I love most about beer is its uncomplicated pleasure. I appreciate the taste but I don’t want to worry about whether I’m drinking the right one with my pork scratchings. As soon as people start trying to match beer with food then it can add a layer of pretension. Do we really want beer sommeliers? Me, I’m going to do my bit to save beer by drinking four pints instead of two when I take my daughter to the pub, and take comfort in the knowledge that I’m educating the next generation of British beer drinkers. • Henry Jeffreys’ first book, Empire of Booze, will be published by Unbound in 2016. @henrygjeffreys",2015-07-24T11:00:23Z,How to get the Brits to drink more beer,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""233eec66c2c75792d6a9ae93ffcd43457e6c4c32""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/22/1437577649924/Pub-With-No-Beer-005.jpg"" alt=""Pub With No Beer"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The British really should learn to drink more beer.

"Ben &amp; Jerry’s cranks out 63 ice cream flavors across the US – but what does it really take to create a brand new pint? Eric Fredette, along with fellow Ben &amp; Jerry’s food scientists Peter Lind, Chris Rivard and Kristin Schimoler, are the company’s official “flavor gurus”, whose job includes inventing the Vermont-based ice cream company’s new ice cream flavors. While traveling, researching food trends and engaging in copious amounts of taste testing sounds like a dream job, Fredette, Lind, Rivard and Schimoler say the job has its challenges too. Failure is part of the process To start, like any creative venture, only 20 out of every 200 ideas for flavors actually become ice cream, and only a handful of these make it to market. “That’s just part of the process,” says Lind, who once spent two and a half years on one product before Ben &amp; Jerry’s killed the idea. “Wavy Gravy” went through 235 variations, and even then, cofounder Ben Cohen said, “No, this isn’t quite right.”  And while Ben &amp; Jerry’s fans deliver 13,000 flavor suggestions to the gurus each year, many write discouraging emails about the flavors they hate. Eric Fredette describes fans as a “rare breed” whose feedback is the “ultimate form of quality control”. “Our fans are good, they know their favorite flavor, and if we change something as simple as the vanilla supplier and it’s not a perfect match, we hear about it and then fix it.” Ben and Jerry’s Scoop Shops, locally owned and operated shops selling their products in 25 countries, including Israel, Greece, Italy and Australia, also offer tasting opportunities for customers and an additional level of flavor control. Lind recalls one rose-flavored trial phase ice cream met a doomed response when a US-based Scoop Shop customer retorted, “This tastes like my grandmother’s armpits.” “We pretty much stayed away from rose after that,” Lind admits.  Demand for excellent ingredients The flavor gurus are also blessed – and perhaps cursed – by their quest for perfect ingredients: only natural and naturally processed ingredients go into their pints. Even the humble “Vanilla” pint, launched in 2012, contains cage free eggs, non-GMO ingredients and Fairtrade certified sugar and vanilla beans. Ben &amp; Jerry’s also supports mandatory labeling of genetically modified organisms and consumers’ rights to know what’s in their food. This stand feels noble to Ben &amp; Jerry’s employees at a time when the Grocery Manufacturers Association estimates 70 to 80% of US food contains genetically modified ingredients. Yet when Ben &amp; Jerry’s converted 100 of its ingredients to non-GMO-sourced, the process was huge, Rivard recalls. “Working with suppliers we had to taste, test and prove every single replacement – it was basically like creating 100 new flavors in a year and a half.”  Incorporating cultural differences  Ben &amp; Jerry’s global availability with new, limited edition flavors inserts additional challenges to finding the correct sweetness or chunk level, and even the packaging of the pints. Rivard notes in Japan, products must be pristine. “Store owners will reject a cup with an eighth inch scratch.” Lind recalls how distributors discontinued “Cherry Garcia” in Europe where the product never caught on. Whether European consumers disliked the name, the cherries or the premise – a tribute to Jerry Garcia – remains a mystery. On the flipside, taking Ben &amp; Jerry’s global inspires new, refreshing flavors. Ben &amp; Jerry’s first Scoop Shop in Tokyo, which opened in spring 2012 in the trendy Harajuku shopping district, features a flavor lab in which in-house flavorists create unique flavors available exclusively in that store. Unique concoctions from the Tokyo Scoop Shop include: “Maccha Made in Heaven: Maccha Green Tea with Caramelized Pecans”, “Passionable Pine: Passion Fruit Ice Cream with Pineapple Chunks and a Raspberry Swirl,” and “Murasaki Imotion: Purple Sweet Potato Ice Cream with Purple Sweet Potato Chunks”.

"New research released 10 years after hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans shows that more residents can access fresh, healthy food at grocery stores. Lead author Adrienne Mundorf of the Tulane Prevention Research Center has found not only that the absolute number of grocery stores in New Orleans has rebounded to pre-Katrina levels, but also that racial disparities in access to grocery stores have decreased.   Related: Misleading reports of lawlessness after Katrina worsened crisis, officials say    Nationwide, studies have found that race is a major factor in access to healthy food: for example, one study found that only 8% of African Americans live in a census tract with a grocery store (compared to 31% of white Americans). In New Orleans, racial disparities in food access worsened in the first years after the storm. But by 2014, more new supermarkets had moved into predominantly African American neighborhoods, the study published in the Journal of Urban Health found.  There is no bright line of evidence that points from grocery stores to better health, but many studies, when considered together, link access and health. Americans who live near grocery stores eat more fruits and vegetables on average, and inserting grocery stores with culturally appropriate, affordable food options into struggling communities can cause measurable improvements in health. These improvements are particularly marked, Mundorf explained, when improved access to fresh food is accompanied by nutrition education. A major 2012 report by the Institute of Medicine focused on obesity as an environmental disease, arguing that policymakers can combat obesity most effectively by ensuring that low-income communities and communities of color have access to healthy foods, safe places to exercise, and evidence-based wellness education in schools and doctors’ offices. Mundorf’s findings suggest that policymakers in New Orleans are beginning to heed this research. Mundorf attributes the progress in New Orleans in part to a “feeling of rebuilding” in the city, and potentially also to the Fresh Food Retailer’s Initiative (FFRI), a cooperative venture between the city, the Food Trust, and the Hope Enterprise Corporation. The FFRI provides low-interest and forgivable loans to help grocers expand, rebuild, or start new grocery stores in vulnerable neighborhoods in New Orleans.  Julia Koprak, senior associate at the Food Trust, explained that the upfront financing helps get new stores established. However, FFRI-funded projects are expected to be self-sustaining in the long run. “By reducing the cost gap to get started, we’ve been able to get grocers established in neighborhoods where they wouldn’t otherwise,” Koprak said. So far, the FFRI has contributed funding for four of the 17 supermarkets that have been founded or rebuilt in New Orleans since 2007. Koprak said the Food Trust hopes to announce new partnerships in New Orleans later this year. “Improving access to groceries is not just about health,” Koprak said. “It’s about economic development, community revitalization, and everyone deserving access to healthy fresh food no matter where they live.” And yet some New Orleans neighborhoods – including neighborhoods in New Orleans East and the Lower Ninth Ward – still lack grocery stores. In the Lower Ninth Ward, a historically African American neighborhood devastated by Katrina, the Backyard Gardener’s Network has arisen in part to address the lack of access to healthy food. Volunteers from the neighborhood plant, grow and cook together, drawing on local food traditions and the knowledge of Lower Ninth Ward gardeners and cooks. Founder Jenga Mwenda has called the lack of access to grocery stores in her neighborhood “an injustice”. Many residents in the Lower Ninth Ward also lack cars, and damaged roads and sidewalks can be impossible to navigate – especially for people with limited mobility. Mundorf and Koprak both pointed to the damaged infrastructure and historical lack of investment in the Lower Ninth as factors that complicate access to food. “Ultimately we really support nutrition education, but until you have good access where you live, it’s hard to make use of that education,” Koprak said. “It’s hard to ask people to follow these nutrition guidelines and purchase and prepare healthy food if they have zero choices.”  For Mundorf, the issue of food access is also personal. She survived cancer and the accompanying treatment in her twenties. “When I was done with treatment, my doctor said, ‘OK, you’re young, your cancer’s gone – stay healthy,’” she said. “Access to fresh fruits and vegetables was integral to my own recovery. Everyone deserves that.”",2015-08-18T12:57:10Z,"Black residents gain increased access to grocery stores post-Katrina, study says","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""7239815319357b6bc05b3d3708f2fadf3b3f7243""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/7239815319357b6bc05b3d3708f2fadf3b3f7243/0_0_5079_3050/1000.jpg"" alt=""new orleans grocery store"" width=""1000"" height=""601"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Racial disparities in food access worsened in first years after hurricane Katrina, but by 2014 gap has decreased as more grocery stores move into black neighborhoods in New Orleans.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>",84,"More supermarkets in African American neighborhoods not only encourage healthier choices, but contribute to a ‘feeling of rebuilding’, findings suggest",http://media.guim.co.uk/7239815319357b6bc05b3d3708f2fadf3b3f7243/0_0_5079_3050/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/18/new-orleans-grocery-stores-food-race-katrina,5,positive
"Summer clothing discounts pulled UK inflation back down to zero last month, bringing more relief to households and taking pressure off the Bank of England to raise interest rates any time soon. Official figures showed inflation on the consumer price index (CPI) measure dipped to zero in June, from 0.1% in May. That was in line with the consensus forecast in a poll of economists by Reuters, although some had predicted prices could be down on a year earlier and mark a return to the negative inflation recorded in April. Back to zero     The UK consumer price index over the last 12 months. Illustration: Office for National Statistics    Some economists predict inflation could still turn negative in the coming months given a recent dip in oil prices and the strength of the pound, which makes UK imports cheaper. “June’s UK consumer prices figures show that the continued weakness of inflation is boosting households’ spending power without having any adverse knock-on effects on wages or spending,” said Samuel Tombs, a senior UK economist at the Capital Economics consultancy.  “Looking ahead, the UK looks set for another brief period of deflation … And while inflation should rebound towards the end of the year when the anniversary of the plunge in oil prices is reached, we think it will take a long time for CPI inflation to return to its target.” The Office for National Statistics said falls in the prices of clothing and food were the main downward pressures on inflation last month. There was also a downward pull thanks to smaller rises in air fares between May and June than a year ago, offsetting a rise in petrol prices last month. There were no large upward effects. Downward drag     Chart showing contributions to the latest inflation figures: the main downward effects came from airfares, food and clothing. Illustration: ONS    The core rate of inflation, which excludes volatile items, such as energy and food, eased last month to 0.8% from 0.9% in May. Bank of England policymakers have appeared relaxed about inflation being well below their 2% target. The dip earlier this year into negative inflation had been widely predicted, including by the Bank’s governor, Mark Carney, after a sharp drop in oil prices since last summer. He recently told Britons to enjoy the period of low prices while it lasted. Economists agree inflation is likely to rebound but say that in the meantime the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) can afford to take its time deciding when to start raising borrowing costs from 0.5%, where they have been for more than six years. Markets are not pricing in a rise until well into 2016. While such low inflation has been characterised by some government critics as a sign of economic fragility, for households it means they are better off in real terms. Official figures on Wednesday are expected to show wages rising 3.3% during the three months to May after growth of 2.7% in the three months to April. That would be the fastest pace for five years and bring relief after years of average pay falling in real terms because it lagged inflation. Some Bank policymakers have expressed concern about wage growth picking up and, in time, raising inflation in the wider economy. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: “The Bank of England needs to determine whether pay growth will continue to accelerate as firms compete for staff, or whether low inflation will keep the overall rate of increase below levels that would normally worry the monetary policy committee into hiking interest rates.” A continued rise in wages could prompt the two MPC members concerned about inflationary pressures – Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty – to vote for a hike as soon as next month, economists have said. Both policymakers voted to lift rates last year. “We expect the two hawks on the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee ... to vote in favour of an immediate rate hike at the August meeting given the uncertainty on Greece has diminished following [Monday’s] agreement,” said James Knightley, an economist at ING Financial Markets. “However, the rest of the MPC are far more cautious and will want to be confident that inflation is indeed heading back towards target before opting for a rate hike. We continue to see the first move in Bank rate coming in February next year.”",2015-07-14T10:18:11Z,Back to zero inflation: falling food and clothing prices drag rate back to 0%,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""a8a1d34513302ac18861c3061275adf111324a4e""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436869037387/c7ebb6e8-4464-44d4-b378-2968e5ec138f-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Clothing discounts and sales have helped lower inflation to 0.0%."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Clothing discounts and sales have helped lower inflation to 0.0%.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",85,Pressure loosens on Bank of England to raise rates as summer clothing discounts and supermarket price war cuts index ,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436869037700/c7ebb6e8-4464-44d4-b378-2968e5ec138f-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/14/zero-inflation-falling-food-clothing-prices,4,negative
"Never mind your hot dog legs – show me the actual sausages. If there is any better use for Instagram than perving on friends’ holiday eating, I don’t know it. Those sun-baked fruit platters, dishes of oil-slicked seafood, trays of colour and texture and sometimes slightly unidentifiable stuff, are the best reasons to travel. Long after the tan has faded and the stress returned, a whiff of something familiar and delicious can transport you back to a table warmed by the sun, and the food shared around it. So when it comes to choosing where to spend those precious two weeks of summer holiday, food is almost as high in my priorities as sunshine. Not in a tour of top-class restaurants sort of way – though I have (more organised) friends who plan their trips exactly like this, with their dinner bookings made almost before their flights – but with markets, street food and local restaurants more in mind. Where will we eat well – and affordably – for the length of our holiday?      Floating fish sandwich stalls on the Bosphorus in Istanbul. Photograph: Jon Hicks/Corbis    For us that’s often Turkey: returning from town, fingers already stained the deep red of cherries, with bags of stickily ripe green figs to be eaten with sharp, creamy local yoghurt; Balık ekmekçi – grilled fresh fish and onions wrapped firmly in pillowy bread – devoured on the banks of the Bosphorus, under the watchful eye of hopeful seagulls; piles of crisp, fragrant calamari to be fought over with friends. (Bad luck if one of those friends is me.) It will be Greece for many, for reasons other than good food (though, from delicious meze to stifado, Greek cuisine can stand with the best of them). For others it’s Italy: a Sicilian holiday dinner of pasta with sardines, sultanas, anchovies and pine nuts still talked about in revered tones by those who ate it; my first bite of pizza in Naples still memorable more than a decade later; and oh god, the gelato. And of course, there’s France, an ordinary salad of tomatoes, shallots and garlic with a chucked-together vinaigrette made almost legendary one family holiday by a combination of ripe fruit and hazy evening sunshine.     Menu outside La Maroma steak house in Buenos Aires. Photograph: Alamy    One friend travelled to China to basically celebrate his own street-food festival – he says he’s still yearning for the rice noodle skewers that come doused in chilli or cumin salt, and fried using an old hand iron and a tin sheet. Others visited Argentina for the ultimate steak and red wine (the amazing pasta and ice cream an unexpected bonus), and Sri Lanka for its richly spiced curries and incredible daal. Sometimes the food adventure is in the actual travelling. A journey on the trans-Siberian railway where it became quickly clear that every item on themenu was mutton, regardless of its description as something else entirely. A train ride to Syria where there was a sign for a buffet car but no actual carriage beyond it, resulting in hasty picnics of bread, hard-boiled eggs and ripe peaches assembled from station kiosks. A flight to India, where the usual sad airline food was replaced with an awe-inspiring curry, with impressive sides, popadoms, and pickles. And sometimes the food adventure is not in restaurants at all, but in home kitchens. I often end up on self-catered jaunts because if you love to cook, a table full of great produce and lots of time in which to prepare it can be a proper luxury, for a couple of nights at least. There’s something particularly lovely about doing this in Britain: ditching the supermarket and snuffling out local foods.      Taverna tables at Karavomilos lake, Kefalonia, Greece. Photograph: Alamy    But better still, of course, is sitting at the home table of a local. A friend who has a Lebanese husband raves about traditional mezze and Beirut streetfood, but saves her highest praise for home-cooked Lebanese dishes such as bemyeh (rice vermicelli, okra and meat stew) and laban ummo (yoghurt soup with lamb chunks). I’ve always thought it’s how Airbnb should work, but I’ve yet to be offered a meal by anyone.   Related: Holiday food: how to find the best restaurants abroad    Can you really recreate that holiday taste when you get home? After a year-long stay in Sydney I yearn for properly ripe avocados smashed on to toast with lime, olive oil and coriander, to no avail. But I turn often to Sabrina Ghayour’s excellent cookbook, Persiana, for a mouthful of Turkey and Syria without the airfares. The joy of perfect tomato bulgar wheat, and chicken fragrant and tart with preserved lemons. A friend’s chilli is worth traveling for in its own right – we will joyfully skip across town (or even country) to devour it – but it’s also the result of 24 years trying to replicate a revelatory Mexican food experience on a childhood trip to California. (He won’t ever outdo that first real chilli moment, he says, but he’s getting closer. The trick? Lots of time, bourbon and beer.) Talking of which, even those who love the country cannot recommend traveling to Germany for the food – “I can honestly say I have never been anywhere in Germany for the cuisine, nor been tempted to cook a massive pork knuckle or make potato soup when I got back,” says a translator friend who visits often and has great affection for the place.

"Should you get a cat, shun meat, live child-free and cancel your Facebook account; or get a dog, gorge yourself on steak, have a huge family – and post about it every day? We look at what new research tells us about the big choices in life Cats v dogs Are you a cat person or a dog person? The UK is renowned as a nation of pet-lovers and – after fish – cats and dogs are by far the most popular; 24% of households own a dog, and 18% own a cat. So which creature is best to share your house with? Some of it obviously comes down to how high-maintenance you want your pet to be; do you really want to take them out for a walk each morning and constantly pick up their poo? Then again, cat allergies are around twice as common as dog allergies. “The evergreen statement is that ‘Dogs like their owner, cats like the owner’s home’ – by which they truly mean ‘cats do not like people’,” says Péter Pongrácz of the Family Dog Project in Budapest, Hungary. But it’s not necessarily as simple as that. Dogs were domesticated before humans invented agriculture and livestock breeding. Their existence depended on their ability to stay close to, and be accepted, by humans. Although dogs are territorial, their concept of territoriality is highly flexible: wherever their owner goes will be their territory. Cats, on the other hand, were domesticated when humans began to build permanent settlements in the Middle East; mostly as a home-guard against pests such as rodents. Their existence depends on the physical home, and so this is what they regard – and defend – as their own territory. Both cat and dog owners attribute highly sophisticated cognitive and social skills to their pets, but it’s very difficult to say which animal is truly superior. Dog behaviour has attracted more research – possibly because cats need to be tested in their own homes. “The real lesson is that dogs and cats provide a similar experience to their owners as a thinking, feeling, empathic companion,” says Pongrácz. They may also boost your health. Children who live with a dog during their first year of life seem to have fewer respiratory tract and ear infections, while several studies have suggested that ownership of either pet reduces stress levels, and may lower blood pressure. Among older adults, owning a cat may even reduce your chances of dying from cardiovascular disease. In this context, the scratched furniture and smelly carpets seem a small price to pay. Children v child-free     Eat, Pray, Love author Elizabeth Gilbert, decided she didn’t want children. Photograph: Rick Madonik/Getty    One in five women have not produced children by the age of 45, a proportion that only looks set to increase in the future. Admittedly, parenthood isn’t always a choice; accidental pregnancy and infertility can scupper even the best-laid plans. But whether you want them or not, there’s no doubt that children have a profound effect on your life, providing a sense of purpose, enduring love and companionship on one hand, while being a massive drain on your financial resources, free-time and the environment, on the other. So which group is happier overall, parents or non-parents? When it comes to romantic relationships, the answer seems clear: “It really does seem to hold that child-free couples are happier with their relationships and happier with their partner than those who are parents,” says Jacqui Gabb of the Open University’s Enduring Love Project (http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/enduringlove/), which examines the factors that make long-term relationships work. “And same-sex couples who are child-free are the happiest group.” And it’s not simply that child-free couples have more time on their hands – they might have a very intense relationship with their God, or have a hobby that takes up a lot of their time, for instance. A key difference seems to be that they are still more likely to try to make time for one another; to say “I love you” and to talk openly to one another, Gabb has found. In this respect, parents might take some lessons from them, be it through going on regular “date nights”, taking the dog for a walk together, or simply going out for a quiet coffee on a regular basis. But there are also upsides to parenting. Although mothers may be less happy with their romantic relationships, they are the happiest group overall, Gabb found. And a large Norwegian study published in the journal Social Indicators Research suggests that childless women report significantly lower life satisfaction and self-esteem than mothers – though this may alter as the expectations society places on women changes. So too, might the impact of having children on men’s lives; for now at least, the average difference in emotional wellbeing between fathers and non-fathers is less marked. Married v single Bridget Jones called them Smug Marrieds – people in long-term relationships who pity the single. But, irritating as they may be, it seems married couples do have at least one thing to feel superior about: their health. Numerous studies have found a correlation between being married and a lower risk of diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular and respiratory problems. The effect is more pronounced for men, but women who are married or live with their partner also seem to have better health.     After a long stint as a bachelor George Clooney wed Amal Alamuddin, in Venice, Sep 2014. Photograph: Sipa USA/REX/Sipa USA/REX    There are various theories about this might be, says George Ploubidis of University College London, who has tracked the long-term health of people born in 1958 and correlated it with their relationship status. “On average, people who are in long-term relationships tend to have a healthier lifestyle than the single,” he says. “They may have a higher joint income, and relationships can also boost social networking and provide a buffer against the stresses of everyday life and major events.” But many single people may be just as healthy or healthier than those who are married. If you look after yourself, have a relatively good income and plenty of friends, you may be as healthy as those Smug Marrieds. For one thing, unmarried people appear to spend more time exercising, which could bring a host of benefits. Neither should you stay in a bad relationship to avoid singledom; a study of 9,011 UK civil servants linked stressful relationships to a heightened risk of heart disease, while other research suggests divorce temporarily raises the risk of death from all causes. In the long-term, however, Ploubidis’s study suggests it’s still probably better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all: “We found that people who experienced divorce or separation – as long as somewhere down the line they start a new relationship – their health at mid-life was similar to those in stable relationships.” Social media v face-to-face contact Are you connected? According to recent statistics, 59% of the UK population now have active social media accounts, with Facebook by far the most popular (43% of the population use it). Social media undoubtedly have benefits, be it staying in touch with friends, hearing about news or events, or connecting with interesting – or useful – strangers. On the other hand, it may be a bit of a pact with the devil; because if you are not careful you could compromise your privacy and hand over your personal data to goodness knows whom. Privacy concerns aside, there may be other downsides to Facebook use. Recent studies have suggested that it may encourage narcissism, and it is associated with loneliness – although this is probably because lonely people are more likely to use Facebook. It’s also possible that constantly reading about your friends’ lives could leave you feeling less satisfied with your own. Ethan Kross at the University of Michigan has been studying the effect of Facebook use on subjective wellbeing in college students. He says that there are two very different ways of using the technology; you can actively communicate with people and post information of your own, or you can be a passive user – simply checking your newsfeed and looking at other people’s photos. “Our research shows that when you engage in this kind of voyeuristic usage of the technology, it consistently leads to declines in how good people feel from one moment to the next,” says Kross. “Possibly this is because you’re constantly comparing yourself to other people, and when people post information, it’s usually of good things.” Being an active user didn’t necessarily make people feel better about themselves, “it just doesn’t harm you,” Kross says. So tighten up your privacy settings; become an active user, rather than a lurker, and you’ll maximise your chances of social media working for you Urban v rural Eighty per cent of the UK population live in towns and cities, yet the urban landscape accounts for just 6.8% of the UK’s land area, so city-dwellers are, relatively speaking, packed together like sardines. Cities generally mean more noise, crime, aggression, and poorer air quality; but there are also more facilities, not just cinemas, galleries and nightclubs; but hospitals, medical specialists, and emergency services are more readily accessible. So how does city living stack up against the rural idyll in terms of health and happiness? It depends. If you compare elderly people living in urban Nottingham or rural Cambridgeshire, village-dwellers report eating a healthier diet, whereas urbanites spend more time walking. Then there are stress levels: recent research suggests that the brains of city-dwellers may be more primed to react to stressful stimuli, while urban living has also been found to raise the risk of anxiety and mood disorders by 21% and 39% respectively. If you look at death rates, the biggest differences between town and country are for respiratory disease and lung cancer, with more city-dwellers succumbing. But at least some of this is related to higher levels of social deprivation and smoking in cities. Accidental death, on the other hand, is more common in the countryside, possibly because there are more fatal road traffic accidents. Then there’s happiness. According to 2011-2014 data from the Office for National Statistics, if you ask people how happy they were yesterday, those living in the City of London, Corby and Wolverhampton will likely give the lowest scores, while residents of Eilean Siar in the Western Isles or Armagh in Northern Ireland will give the highest. City of London residents also said they were the most anxious, while those living in rural Fermanagh in Northern Ireland reported the lowest anxiety levels. However, the differences between areas are pretty small and are likely dwarfed by factors such as health, relationship status or employment status. But “in general, those who live in urban areas have lower life-satisfaction, a lower sense that the things they do are worth while, and higher anxiety levels than those who live in rural areas, regardless of their age,” says Lucy Tinkler, head of the personal wellbeing team at the ONS. Omnivore v vegan     Being vegan didn’t prevent Carl Lewis from winning ten Olympic medals. Photograph:    G.RANCINAN/CORBIS SYGMA    Depending on what you read, tucking into a juicy steak is either a death sentence or a delicious way to boost your iron levels. Veganism, meanwhile, is de rigueur for some, with celebrities such as Beyoncé turning their backs on meat for at least limited periods, if not entirely. So should we follow? From an environmental perspective, avid meat consumption is bad news. As much as 32% of greenhouse gas emissions come from rearing animals for food, particularly cattle, while it takes 15,500 litres of water (equivalent to a small swimming pool) to produce a single kilogram of beef. But eliminating livestock, or substituting cattle with chickens or pigs, isn’t a perfect solution: there’s plenty of pasture land that can’t be used to grow crops, but can be grazed for ever. And animals can be fed the bits of crops – like stalks and leaves – that we can’t eat, reducing waste. Even Friends of the Earth believes meat consumption can be sustainable, but we need to eat less and cut out mass-produced options. It’s a similar picture where our health is concerned. Numerous studies have linked the consumption of red meat with bowel cancer and heart disease, though the precise degree of risk is up for debate. The European-wide EPIC trial, for instance, found no link between the consumption of fresh red meat and cancer, but concluded that for every 50 grams of processed meat (roughly equivalent to a sausage) people consume a day, the risk of early death from all causes increases by 18%. “Eating meat is good for the intake of certain micro-nutrients, but consumption should not be too high; that’s the only reasonable advice we can give for now,” says Sabine Rohrmann, an epidemiologist at the University of Zurich, and lead researcher of the EPIC trial. “And processed meat should definitely not be on the menu every day.” But would it be healthier to go vegetarian? The EPIC results suggest not. “What we see from studies like EPIC is an indication that people who eat small amounts of meat are as healthy, or maybe healthier, than vegetarians,” says Rohrmann. Possibly this is because vegetarianism doesn’t always automatically equate to a healthy diet. Also, there’s no evidence that eating poultry or fish, which are packed with protein and nutrients, increases cancer risk. “It is perfectly fine to be a vegetarian, but you should take care about what you’re eating to ensure you don’t become deficient in nutrients such as iron, zinc and B vitamins,” says Rohrmann. Save v spend The debate over whether to pursue a policy of austerity, or spend our way out of debt, rages on at a national level, but what about our personal finances? Save those pennies for a rainy day, or splash out on the latest gadget that promises to boost your productivity or simply gives you pleasure?     Would Kim and Kanye be just as happy on $75,000? Photograph: Theo Wargo/WireImage for Gabrielle's Angel    People often say that money can’t buy you happiness, but Elizabeth Dunn, professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia and co-author of Happy Money, says: “Income does matter to happiness; it’s better to make more money than not a lot. But the relationship is smaller than most people assume.” Indeed, a recent study found that once people reach an annual salary of $75,000 (about £48,000) any additional income has no bearing on how much they laugh or smile on any given day. What’s arguably equally important though, is how you spend your money. When Dunn and her colleagues randomly gave college students $5 or $20, and either instructed them to spend it on themselves or another person, those who spent it on someone else reported a happier mood for the rest of the day, regardless of how much money they received. On the basis of this, and other research, Dunn has come up with five rules for getting the biggest happiness bang for your buck. Besides spending your money on other people, you’re likely to get more pleasure from buying experiences such as holidays or trips to the theatre, than from material objects. You should also try to make spending a treat; having our favourite things a little less often seems to enhance our ability to enjoy them. Similarly, delaying gratification by saving for things seems to produce more pleasure than simply buying them on credit, when they can appear to come for free. Finally, buy time: “Spending money on a cleaner may free you up to enjoy your Saturday afternoon with your family rather than tidying the house,” says Dunn.",2015-07-14T07:45:09Z,Get married or stay single?

"The number of UK food suppliers and farmers struggling to stay afloat has leapt more than 50% in 12 months, as a bitter supermarket price war continues to take its toll. The industry has never been tougher for Britain’s smallest suppliers, said the study from insolvency specialists Begbies Traynor, after its research found 1,622 growers and suppliers in “significant” financial distress in the three months to the end of June – up from 1,052 at the same time last year. The researchers said there was a “new savage landscape” in food retailing and suppliers were bearing the brunt of the big supermarkets’ drastic turnaround plans, aimed at clawing back market share from discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl.    Price slashing is not just a short-term pain but something that’s here to stay  Begbies Traynor     Almost 90% of the struggling food companies were small and medium-sized businesses, the researchers found, and it is feared some could fall into administration. Significant problems are defined as where a business is facing legal claims for unpaid bills or has suffered a “sustained or marked deterioration” in its financial health – for example in its levels of working capital. Begbies Traynor claimed the outlook was even bleaker and small food suppliers had to face the harsh reality that “price slashing is not just a short-term pain but something that’s here to stay”. All of the big four supermarkets – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons – have struggled with falling sales as shoppers’ habits change, with many people ditching the traditional big weekly shop in favour of several visits to smaller local shops and discounters. Morrisons has clawed back small rises in sales in the past two months but it comes against a background of consistent falls since the beginning of last year.  In April, Tesco reported a record £6.4bn loss, though the retailer claimed it was on the road to recovery. The following month, Asda revealed its worst sales figures since the 1990s, while in June, Sainsbury’s revealed its sixth quarter of falling sales. Even upmarket Waitrose has been feeling the pain; it recently started giving loyalty card shoppers money off their favourite items, and indicated it would split the bill for this scheme with suppliers that had signed up.    Related: Food fight: the secrets of the supermarket price war    The price wars have kept grocery prices falling constantly since last autumn, bringing prices down by 1.7% in a year, retail researchers Kantar Worldpanel said last month.  The pressure on suppliers comes despite supermarkets facing growing scrutiny from Britain’s grocery industry watchdog, the Groceries Code Adjudicator (GCA), which launched its first formal investigation into a supermarket in February, with an inquiry into allegations that Tesco delayed payments to suppliers and unfairly handled payments for shelf promotions. More recently, as the Guardian revealed last week, the watchdog has asked Morrisons to explain why it is seeking unscheduled payments from suppliers. Begbies Traynor appeared to blame aggressive price-cutting and delays in payments to suppliers for much of the misery being endured by firms in this sector. Julie Palmer, a partner and retail expert at the firm, said: “The supermarkets have managed to successfully rebase their own models by reducing product ranges, moving away from bulk-buy offers and squeezing supplier margins still further, while failing to clean up their act on late payments, taking more than a month longer than agreed terms to settle debts with suppliers.” She added: “Some are even looking into launching their own food manufacturing facilities to give them even tighter control over costs and the ability to offer still more aggressive pricing – signalling yet another nightmare scenario on the horizon for the UK food supply chain.” The GCA now has the power to fine supermarkets up to 1% of their turnover if they are found to have breached the groceries code but Palmer claimed this may be of limited use because a recent study found that almost one in five suppliers to the 10 biggest retailers were reluctant to raise any issues with the regulator “for fear of retribution from their largest source of income”.  However, there has been some good news for suppliers; last week Aldi became the first retailer in the UK to sign up to a “fruit and veg pledge” drawn up by the National Farmers Union, which aims to improve long-term relationships with British growers and suppliers, improving their profitability.",2015-07-19T23:01:04Z,Supermarket price war takes toll on UK food suppliers,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""354c3ea2b01b5a587eb0559b420e0e206098e35f""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/354c3ea2b01b5a587eb0559b420e0e206098e35f/0_298_5022_3014/1000.jpg"" alt=""Strong discounting at Tesco Extra being used to bring in more customers."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Discounting at Tesco Extra.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>",88,Increase in number of small and medium-sized food companies in ‘significant’ financial distress,http://media.guim.co.uk/354c3ea2b01b5a587eb0559b420e0e206098e35f/0_298_5022_3014/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/20/supermarket-price-war-takes-toll-uk-food-suppliers,4,neutral
"While clubs and restaurants each serve their own vital purpose, the two might not seem like obvious bedfellows. But away from, and sometimes just off the dance floor, a surprising number of clubbing’s most enduring characters and institutions have also successfully dabbled in the culinary, dining and drinking (while seated) scenes. Most notably and recently, James Murphy continued his eclectic series of post-LCD Soundsystem ventures with the opening of a wine bar, The Four Horsemen in Williamsburg, which has been met equally with acclaim and groan-worthy All His Friends puns. Meanwhile, in Queens, Justin Carter and Eamon Harkin, already beloved in New York for their long-running Mister Saturday and Mister Sunday parties, have taken the laid-back and local aesthetic they’ve established on their dance floors, and applied it to a new bar, Nowadays.        Related: Mister Saturday Night's favourite tracks    Located next to a freight railroad, its design is reminiscent of their breezy party spaces, lined with trees, littered with picnic tables and romantically illuminated with strings of hanging bulbs. It is certainly an appealing prospect through the dog days of summer. Meanwhile, Carter and Harkin’s Mister Sunday parties will continue for this year at its Industry City spot in Brooklyn each weekend until September, but they hope to switch locations to their bar over the next few years. The sound of a Mister DJ set ranges from obscure acid house to classic hip hop and soul, all delivered in a straight-up club style. The pair are two of the most accommodating hosts you could hope to meet, and the only thing rolling at Nowadays is the lawn, but is artisan food ever a little too polite for the edge of the rave? “We need [Nowadays] to be something that survives outside of the club world, so when we eventually add Mister Sunday to it, it already has its own identity as a nice place to hang out,” explains Carter, who stresses the pair never solely wanted to open a club space.  “How can we make this feel right for us, for where we live and what’s going on in New York right now? New York isn’t Berlin, and it’s not the 90s anymore. That’s actually what the name Nowadays is about – that the good times aren’t behind us, that we’re creating a place for here and now.”     The good times aren’t behind us ... we’re creating a place for here and now.  Justin Carter     The food at Nowadays is contemporary but classic Americana, from grass-fed beef burgers to kale salads, complemented by a well-stocked bar providing drinks by the local likes of Queen’s Brewery and Brooklyn Soda Works. Carter and Harkin’s sole partner in the venture is Mark Connell, who also runs beloved local dive NoLiTa, and the restaurant Estela, approved by Barack Obama himself.      Midnight Marauding: Nowadays at night Photograph: Natalie Keyssar    Music remains the focus, however, with the duo digging deep in their crates and digitalising their extensive vinyl record collection to soundtrack the bar, even generously giving staff the chance to play DJ and choose whatever artist they wish to help draw the night in. And while other establishments spend thousands of dollars curating bespoke, mood setting Spotify playlists, Carter and Harkin are simply letting many of their favourite albums play in their entirety, just as their creators had intended. “We think that Nowadays is the sort of place where people are going to want to hang out for a long time, and when you’re playing a full album, it let’s you live in an artist’s world for more than just a couple minutes,” explains Carter, who has heard that Murphy incidentally has the same idea at his Williamsburg hang.  “Even if we’re playing an album with some hits on it, it’s within the context of a larger album. Even if it’s a hit record – listening to Off The Wall in its entirety is totally different to just listening to Get On The Floor, then moving on to some other song. Listening to the whole album extends the moment.”     Dinner with DJ Seth Troxler in Glastonbury Photograph: Kate Hutchinson for the Guardian    Elsewhere, the outspoken (and often naked) DJ, Seth Troxler prides himself equally on his sense of humour and cooking. And while the former divides opinion, pretty much anyone with access to a set of tastebuds is all for his meat driven Smokey Tails venture, which alongside Lionel Richie, was arguably the sleeper hit of this year’s Glastonbury festival. Troxler was also the judge of last year’s Amsterdam Dance Event DJ Cook Off, having won the contest three years in a row. The Twisted Fork currently lies with Kompakt’s Danish electro producer Kölsch, who won with It Came From The North, an understated cod dish that might prove as emotional as his own anthemic Der Alte. In Germany, the celebrated selector Ata leads an enviable double life as both a much respected DJ and renowned chef. He’s best known for his minimalist, intimate venue Live At Robert Johnson, from which he also operates a small supper gathering, Club Michel, located within the club’s offices.

"Human error almost certainly resulted in hundreds of thousands of Co-op customers being charged twice for purchases made from its food stores and petrol station, the retailer has said. Financial records revealed on Thursday morning that the supermarket had taken in twice its usual amount from customers on Wednesday. A swift investigation found that human error was “almost certainly” to blame, according to a Co-op spokesman, but the exact cause was yet to be determined. The company has declined to say how many customers were charged twice, but it is thought that hundreds of thousands of people were affected across Co-op’s 2,800 stores and 200 petrol stations in the UK. A Co-op spokesman said: “Due to a processing error, customers who shopped with us or used a petrol filling station on 7 July using a credit or debit card were charged twice. “We would like to apologise to all those affected, and reassure customers that refunds will be made directly into their accounts within 24 hours. We will also reimburse any customers who have incurred bank charges as a result of this error.”   Related: Co-op commits £125m to slash prices of fruit and veg    Konstantinos Kougios, 40, discovered that he had been charged £7.08 twice when he read the Guardian article about the Co-op error on Thursday.  “It’s disturbing but, OK, it’s a mistake and they found it themselves,” he said. “It’s a bit worrying if I didn’t find it but it feels like a genuine mistake.” Retail experts speculated that the error could have been caused by an employee pushing the payments through twice by mistake. James Walker, founder of the free complaints resolution service Resolver, said some retailers process transactions in one huge batch.  “My gut feeling is that the system would have said ‘batch fail’ so they [the employee] resubmitted the batch [leading to two charges],” he said. “This is a really rare event. I don’t think I’ve seen a large company make such an error.” However, Walker praised the way Co-op handled what could have been a PR catastrophe. The retailer admitted the error within hours of it being discovered, urging customers with concerns to call the careline on 0800 068 6727. “It’s one of those little embarrassing ‘My trousers are down, what am I going to do?’ moments,” said Walker. “It’s good they owned up about it quite quickly but what else are they going to do?” It comes weeks after John Lewis overtook the Co-op to become the UK’s largest worker-owned business. Figures showed the Co-op’s food sales for 2014 fell 2.1% to £7.1bn. This was a result of the wider Co-operative Group being hit by the reduction in its stake in the Co-operative Bank – which dropped from 100% to 20% – following its emergency re-capitalisation by hedge funds after the bank nearly collapsed in 2013.

"As Miss Piggy once sagely advised: “Never eat more than you can lift.” The trouble is that we seem to buy food as though we intend to do just this and as a result a huge amount goes to waste. According to the UN, developed countries throw away around 30-40% of all food purchased. And if food waste was cut by a quarter, world famine could be solved. Here in the UK, of the 41m tonnes of food that is bought each year, 15m is wasted.   Related: Produced but never eaten:  a visual guide to food waste    You might think supermarkets are the biggest culprits. But the truth is that most have made major strides in recent years. The waste-advisory charity Wrap’s best estimate is that supermarket waste accounts for less than 2% of what gets chucked out each year. Part of that is down to advances in supply-chain technology. As you might guess fresh food and short shelf-life products account for a lot of what gets binned. But these days good demand forecasting and inventory-planning software can handle even the trickiest items. Supermarkets have an interest in avoiding waste because margins on fresh produce tend to be quite tight. If you make 25p for every £1 of broccoli sold you have to sell three pieces to make up for the loss from one gone bad. So if you have noticed fewer items with reduced stickers, it’s because they’re getting a grip. What waste remains is at least partly driven by consumers expecting fresh food items to be constantly available and stacked in attractive displays – both factors pushing food retailers to order more than they can sell. The biggest contributor to our food-waste shame is household rubbish, which accounts for almost half the food thrown away in the UK. Of course many of us make bad decisions about food, especially when we’re hungry, over-ordering in restaurants and over-buying in shops. The most primitive parts of our brains, faced with feast, react as though famine were just around the corner.    Many of us make bad decisions, especially when we’re hungry, over-ordering in restaurants and over-buying in shops    And yet the game seems to be stacked against consumers. Supermarkets may strive to eliminate spoilage while food is in their supply chain, but once you’ve paid for something it’s not their problem. They’d argue, not unfairly, that they have tried to ensure the food you buy is as fresh as possible to give you the best possible chance to consume it before it goes bad. Back in 2010 Tesco even briefly experimented with a “buy one, get one free later” scheme to help reduce waste. But for the most part, food retail is structured and incentivised to get us to buy as much as possible, regardless of whether we actually need it. In the developing world only 6-15% of food gets thrown out despite poorer infrastructure, less reliable logistics, hotter climates and inferior refrigeration. Indeed weight for weight, in places such as sub-Saharan Africa and south and south-east Asia, people waste only around a tenth of what we do. The overwhelming differentiator seems to be the value that we attach to food. Having a full fridge to cater to our every whim and those of our families seems more important than not having a full bin. Until we truly know what it is like not to have enough (and while too many people in this wealthy country of ours have been finding out, few of us really know what it’s like to go without) we’ll continue to throw away food in obscene quantities. And neither technology nor the sight of people leaving lands of not enough for places of plenty is likely to change that.",2015-08-13T13:53:32Z,We could end famine if we cut food waste by a quarter – so why don’t we?,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""c2f237bd9976d0ca8b93de7f744fdb60199999c0""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/c2f237bd9976d0ca8b93de7f744fdb60199999c0/0_131_3500_2100/1000.jpg"" alt=""Food in a rubbish bin"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">‘The biggest contributor to our food-waste shame is household rubbish, which accounts for almost half the food thrown away in the UK.’ </span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Nick Ansell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>",91,"It’s not supermarkets’ fault – consumers are the biggest culprits.

"Cuts in food aid to vulnerable refugees in the Middle East are making young men “prime targets” for recruitment by extremist groups, a top official at the UN’s World Food Programme said on Thursday.  Lack of funds may also force the organisation to order further cuts in provisions to Syrian refugees in the Middle East, many of whom already have to survive on a little over $13 a month in food allowances.  “The one thing that they [refugee families] were not concerned about was their children having enough to eat,” said Ertharin Cousin, the WFP’s executive director, at a briefing for reporters in Beirut during a regional tour. “They have now added the ability to feed their children to the list.”  There are 1.1 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon, meaning that one out of every five people living in the country have been displaced by the war. Earlier this summer, the WFP announced that it was cutting food allowances to the most vulnerable refugees here to $13.5 a month per person, an amount that barely provides them with enough food for a week to 10 days. The organisation has also cut its recipients from about 900,000 at the start of the year to 770,000 today.  The WFP now needs to raise $163m by the start of October in order to continue with its current levels of assistance to Syrians until the end of the month, before appealing for more aid. The organisation spends about $25m a week in food aid.  Cousin said that the burden of providing food to vulnerable families is increasingly falling on children and young men, who are abandoning schools or entering the labour force, and who are becoming more vulnerable to recruitment by extremist organisations.  “What concerns me is the young men who I was meeting with, who are feeling that responsibility that we talked about, who see no other method of feeding their family other than to return to Syria,” she said. “They become prime targets for the Islamist extremist groups who are paying money for service. So if that then is how they can feed their family, that is attractive and that is something that should worry us all.” Thousands of young children have entered the labour force in Lebanon. In the capital Beirut, many work as shoe shiners or sell street wares, often leaving them vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, and sleeping rough. Some turn to prostitution, the highest paying job they can find on the city’s streets.  In the agricultural hinterland of the Bekaa Valley, many work long hours in the fields and warehouses for a measly wage, skipping school to provide for large families.  Refugees in Lebanon are particularly vulnerable, because the overwhelming majority are women and children, and roughly half of the refugees were displaced more than once inside Syria before seeking refuge in Lebanon, and have been left with few resources. The country also lacks formal camps to house the large refugee population, leaving people to reside amid local communities, increasing tensions and competition over jobs.  In Jordan, the WFP employs a two-tier system, providing just $7 of food aid to vulnerable refugees and $14 to the extremely vulnerable. The first group will be cut off from the aid programme at the start of September, due to funding shortfalls.  “Our plan B is to continue to alter the programme, to expend as much money as we have to serve as many people as possible for as long as possible,” said Cousin. “How much assistance we provide will depend on how much money we receive. How many people will we serve will depend on how much money we receive. How long we serve them will depend on how much money we receive.”  Cousin said she raised the possibility of allowing Syrians to enter the labour force with the Lebanese government, doing jobs where they will not compete with the local population, such as in agriculture, construction and restaurants. The proposal faces significant hurdles in Lebanon’s delicately balanced sectarian system, and in the growing resentment towards the large refugee population that has stretched the country’s infrastructure past breaking point.  But the immediate problem of food cuts will further strain refugee households, most of whom are forced to eat fewer meals and to completely cut meat products out of their diet, resorting to little more than staples such as bulgur wheat and rice to satisfy hunger.  Cousin said the funding shortfalls were due to WFP relying entirely on voluntary contributions, and the enormity of the global refugee crisis, which has displaced 60 million people worldwide.  “We have more conflict-related crises simultaneously occurring than at any other time in recent memory,” she said. “In the Syrian crisis there is no political solution on the horizon, which means that this population continues to be affected, [and] the stories of ordinary people is diminished by the story of the conflict.”  She couched her appeal for aid in the terms of recognising the “common humanity” shared with the refugees. “Every culture and every religion in the world says we must feed the poor,” she said. “They are the victims of an evolving situation that is as much a crisis today as when they left their homes three or four years ago.”",2015-08-13T13:44:27Z,Food aid cuts 'making refugees targets for Isis recruitment',"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""84e5375149b2acc01d44caa7ee4344e9e27cfbfc""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/84e5375149b2acc01d44caa7ee4344e9e27cfbfc/0_0_3000_1799/1000.jpg"" alt=""Executive Director of World Food Programme, Ertharin Cousin, called for more food aid."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Executive Director of World Food Programme, Ertharin Cousin, called for more food aid.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Giorgio Cosulich/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",92,World Food Programme director says some Middle East refugees get just $13 a month for food,http://media.guim.co.uk/84e5375149b2acc01d44caa7ee4344e9e27cfbfc/0_0_3000_1799/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/13/food-aid-cuts-making-refugees-targets-for-isis-recruitment,1,negative

"Beneath the blue waters 100m off the coast of Noli in northwest Italy lies a cluster of balloon-like pods pegged to the seabed by ropes half a dozen or so metres long. Inside a range of produce is being grown, including red cabbage, lettuce, beans, basil and strawberries.  It may sound like something you’d find in a science fiction novel, but this is the work of Ocean Reef Group. With the help of agricultural experts, the Genova-based scuba diving company is applying its knowledge and technology to finding new ways to produce food.   Related: The buzz around indoor farms and artificial lighting makes no sense    The research project, known as Nemo’s Garden, began in 2012 and currently consists of seven pods – biospheres – each of which can hold around 8-10 trays or 22 plant pots. Having improved the design of the pods over time following episodes of rot and flooding, the company is ready to scale up its testing with the ultimate aim of commercialising its operations. The company has a local government permit to operate for five months of the year (May to September) and the pod structure has been patented. The project is currently seeking financial assistance through a crowdfunding campaign which ends this week.   Inside the pods The company uses a version of hydroponics, creating fresh water through desalination. Seawater within the structures evaporates, drops condense on the roof and then drip back down as fresh water to feed the herbs and vegetables.      Orto Di Nemo - Nemo’s Garden Project   Unlike underground hydroponic systems and greenhouses, which rely on various heating and cooling systems and LED lights to regulate the temperature, submersion in seawater offers a stable temperature while avoiding exposure to extreme weather conditions on land. When it comes to sunlight, studies have shown that a majority of plants – although not seaweed – are dependent on the red spectrum in light for physiological development; the red can filter out at depths of around five to 15m. To address this, the pods are submerged five to eight metres below the surface; they could potentially go deeper but more data is needed to work out the viability of this. Jon Old is co-founder of The Wasabi Company. The horseradish-like vegetable is regarded as one of the most intensive crops to grow. It involves a lot of watering and is vulnerable to high temperatures and direct sunlight, so could potentially be ideal for underwater farming. Old is excited by the potential of the Nemo Project model: “certain aspects are very appealing, like the sealed environment, no pests to wander in, no disease spores to blow in on the wind, and no slugs. If we assume the underwater [farm] is structurally sound, I think it would be fantastic. It’d be like working in a huge, dry aquarium all day.” Meeting future food demands  Qualified divers are required to maintain and operate the pods. Luca Gamberini, whose family has been running the Ocean Reef Group for six decades, acknowledges this is a sticking point, but firmly believes underwater farming can be more than just a plaything for growing high-value, niche crops.     The Nemo’s Garden team is keen to develop food growing opportunities for regions lacking much suitable soil or water, although others have expressed concern that projects such as this could disrupt the local food infrastructure. Photograph: AFP    Although the cultivation of Nemo’s Garden is yet to reach commercial scale, the aim of the project is to see whether that is a viable prospect and to plant more varieties of crops in the process, something that Gamberini believes is technically possible. Tests carried out by Ocean Reef Group suggest that crops underwater grow faster than their counterparts, according to the company. Ocean Reef Group has received interest from businesses and organisations, but has so far decided against selling the concept. Gamberini believes its place in the food system could be dynamic, from small producers to NGOs working on nutrition projects in developing countries.   Related: Monsanto's new $1bn herbicide shows our bias towards hi-tech solutions    “That [meeting future food demands] is the aim, and it could be a sustainable way of agriculture,” he says. “Not just local businesses, but for large parts of the world. Starting from Middle Eastern and tropical countries such as the Maldives, where there is not much [suitable] soil or fresh water ... [to] southern California, which is experiencing droughts.” Not everyone is convinced. Rachel Kerr is a relief worker who has worked on nutrition projects in sub-Saharan Africa. “My concern would be whether a set-up like this would disrupt the local food infrastructure. Coastal communities often rely on fish not just as food but as a source of income,” she says. “It would need to respect local customs and be mindful of the environment [the ocean].” Gamberini acknowledges that some people may not buy into the idea of underwater farming, but believes it has the potential to work harmoniously with other food production methods. Despite his optimism, however, he remains cautious about its long-term potential.  “We know that we can grow plants underwater, we know they grow faster. We now need to finalise our research ... hopefully by the end of the year, or next,” he says. “Worst case scenario, if we discover Nemo’s Garden isn’t feasible in terms of size, logistics and economics, is that it’ll be a credible eco-tourism resource, as scuba diving sites for islands and places with warm waters.”",2015-08-13T09:15:02Z,"Under the sea: the underwater farms growing basil, strawberries and lettuce","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""4b1c45535a45a5c2c4dbec7cee13ab0ff5a5add8""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/13/1439456405250/939351e5-1c94-428b-8f15-c221e0f5d300-460x276.png"" alt=""A diver visits one of the Nemo’s Garden growing pods."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A diver visits one of the Nemo’s Garden growing pods off the coast of northwest Italy.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>",94,Scuba divers and agricultural experts develop a project to work out if growing plants in pods on the seabed could be a viable solution to future food security,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/13/1439456405885/6d3562d0-7d82-44af-898b-bc782243a96e-140x84.png,http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/aug/13/food-growing-underwater-sea-pods-nemos-garden-italy,6,positive

"How much is a box of cereal? Fix an answer in your head before you carry on. Now meet Louisa Masters, running her eye over a panoply of breakfast options in my local Tesco, before eventually alighting on a box of Special K, balancing it carefully on top of a small pyramid of other groceries and making for the till. Louisa, an office administrator on her way home from work, pauses outside to discuss the factors that informed her selection. “Ooh, I don’t know, you’ve got me thinking now,” she says, seeming a bit uneasy, as if she’d been asked about her tax affairs or her medical records. “Well, I usually get Special K. I like it! And it was on offer, wasn’t it?” It was. Louisa looks chuffed at this news. “I like getting a deal,” she explains. “It’s ridiculous how much money you can save these days.” So, how much is the cereal usually, then? “A box of Special K? I’d say it’s a couple of quid. £1.50 on offer.” How much for, though? “Er … just for a box, like a normal box. I don’t know! Just the usual box.” Her interrogation over, Louisa is visibly relieved. “I don’t really think about it like that, to be honest. How did I do?”   Related: The daftest in-store deals – in pictures    Louisa – like, I suspect, most of us – didn’t do brilliantly. Her 360g box of cereal did cost £2, but that was the special offer price, not the usual price, which, according to Tesco’s label, is £3.14. And the meaning of the “special offer” was slightly undermined by the fact most of the cereal on display bore the red and yellow labels that denote there’s a money-saving deal to be had. It was further called into question by the fact that, about a mile away, another branch of Tesco was offering another box of Special K for £2, also on special offer – except this box held 500g of cereal, nearly 40% more than the “New, bigger pack!” Louisa had bought. You can’t really blame her, or the rest of us. The modern supermarket is a riot of multicoloured discounts and promotions, with a fluctuating lineup of offers that you can hardly be expected to analyse when you’re on your commute. When confronted with such an array of savings, the natural response is to tune it out. Tour the aisles with your eye on the prices, however, and the absurdity of the situation swiftly becomes apparent. For example: why is a box of milk chocolate Krave £4.19 when every other non-luxury brand available – special offer or not – sells for less than £3? Why does a pack of plastic pint tumblers retailing for £2 appear in a promotional bin with economical-looking red-and-yellow labelling when it isn’t discounted at all? And if, among the seven well-stocked rows that make up the “world food” section, only 16 of the 58 items are not on offer, what does the term even mean? Wouldn’t it be more honest to call those 16 products “abnormally expensive”? The answers to these questions are deeply mysterious, known only to the team of street economists who make up Tesco’s pricing unit. But the wider explanation is clear: we are in the crossfire of a price war, one that has only been intensified by the hugely successful emergence of the new discounters, Aldi and Lidl.     Lidl: where prices sit above, not below, the products. Photograph: David Cole/Rex Shutterstock    This week, the industry regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) strapped on its body armour and joined the fray, ruling, after a so-called super-complaint from consumer group Which?, that the supermarkets were guilty of “poor practice that could confuse or mislead shoppers”. Asking the government to issue fresh guidelines, it pointed to complicated unit pricing (where comparison from product to product is made difficult by inconsistent quantities), “was/now” offers where the “now” price is available for longer than the “was” ever was, and sharp practice on subtly shrinking pack sizes as areas of concern. Despite its criticism, though, the CMA’s analysis fell well short of a comprehensive rebuke of the supermarkets’ tactics. Yes, there were examples of bad practice, but it said problems were “not occurring in large numbers across the whole sector” and stopped short of the legal action it was entitled to take. The trouble, it concluded, was a few bad apples – or, at least, a few badly priced ones. Even as Which? hailed the report as vindication of its complaint, industry representatives such as the British Retail Consortium declared victory for themselves. Neil Saunders, managing director of the retail research agency Conlumino, says: “In an industry as vast as this, with all the products they sell, there’s bound to be some of that kind of thing. I don’t think there’s a really serious cause for concern here.” In fact, he says, pressure from the discounters has improved things: “The supermarkets are up against that simplicity of message and pricing structure. So, they’ve had to adapt and do the same themselves.” Yet, according to consumer analyst Kantar Worldpanel, 40% of grocery spending is now on promoted items, and the CMA has been lambasted in some quarters. The Guardian’s consumer affairs correspondent, Rebecca Smithers, described the report as a “whitewash”; financial analyst Louise Cooper accused the CMA of falling to “regulatory capture” – becoming too close to the industry it is supposed to be overseeing. Perhaps there’s a bigger question in play, one that can’t easily be resolved by a spot analysis of prices or any amount of regulation.     ‘According to consumer analyst Kantar Worldpanel, 40% of grocery spending is now on promoted items.’ Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images    “Whatever the report says, it wouldn’t even be possible for someone to look across tens of thousands of products and maximise their choices,” says Leigh Caldwell, partner at behaviour research and pricing firm The Irrational Agency, and author of The Psychology of Price. “The supermarket is just such a tricky decision-making environment. The potential for confusion and distraction is high. No one remembers the price of the cereal they bought two months ago. And the CMA doesn’t really have the ability to focus on that. It’s very hard to write rules that say, ‘You are not allowed to create this level of cognitive complexity for the consumer.’” Whenever he goes into a supermarket, Leigh says, he looks for a two-litre bottle of Coke. “You’d think it would be such a standard product. But every time you go in to a given store you’ll find it’s a different price: £1.15; £2.09. And it’s frequently promoted, 2 for £2, or something that will be an absolute no-brainer. I think this is so that people don’t have any memorable price that seems “correct”. If it’s a category where people have a strong anchor, the supermarkets want to disrupt it.” I try Leigh’s exercise in Tesco, and find the Coca-Cola with a sense that I’ve stumbled on a secret key to the mystery. It’s priced at £1.94. Not brilliant, I think, but not bad, within the reasonable range, comparable to the other brands in the soft drinks aisle. It’s only when I note down the details that I realise that, whereas the competitors are all two litres, the identical-looking Coke is a quarter-litre less. Is all this part of a dastardly plan to part us from our cash? Maybe not. With so many items to keep track of, it wouldn’t be very surprising if some of the problems that have so exercised Which? are the product of cock-up, not conspiracy. The Guardian’s own readers’ anthology of dubious deals – crusty rolls 40p, two for £1! – seems simply too bonkers to be put down to malice. “I’d love to say it’s this big, machiavellian plan, but the main thing to blame is human stupidity,” says Phillip Adcock, author of Shoppology: The Science of Supermarket Shopping. “It’s inexperienced junior people running a formula. They’re all running so fast to keep up with each other, but they can’t keep up with the offers in their own stores.”     One retail pricing specialist says ‘buyers aren’t as clever as people make out’. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images    If you imagine every supermarket price is set by a ruthlessly efficient algorithm that examines all the figures and works out the sweet spot for maximum profitability, think again: this isn’t Amazon. Instead, says Caldwell, “it’s often pricing teams with dozens of people looking through data and making decisions: let’s look at soft drinks, let’s see what promotional spend Coca-Cola will give us and let’s price things accordingly”. This pattern is set by a belief that the simplest way to make money is by extracting as much as possible from suppliers, not consumers. “They’re obsessed with ‘back margin’ – the money you make by charging suppliers for ancillary things,” says Adcock. “So, they start to create these almost fictitious things they can sell, whether it’s a prime shelf [at the height a shopper is most likely to see] or a gondola end [the promotional buckets often found at the top of the aisle]. Their whole job is screwing the suppliers.” Indeed, the famous psychological tricks designed to make you spend as much as humanly possible have lost the supermarkets’ attention: where fiendishly innovative store designers once set aisles deliberately wide in the belief that doing so made shoppers walk more slowly, and moved items around to force us to look more closely (a theory that was later debunked), the focus has shifted. “The battle now is getting them in the store in the first place,” says Saunders. Adcock agrees: “These days, they’re just warehouses with forklifts,” he says, sounding rather mournful. “All that psychological stuff, it’s all gone.” A retail pricing specialist with extensive experience of one of the “big four” supermarkets agrees: “I don’t think it’s deliberate at all,” he says. “Buyers aren’t as clever as people make out. They’re fixated on what their competition is up to – everyone is following everyone else.” In his view, this is the reason for the fluctuation in prices that stops customers figuring out an “anchor”: not conscious policy, but the consequence of each supermarket constantly reacting to the others, an endless merry-go-round of adjustment without much reason behind it. Indeed, none of this is really about what works for consumers. The bottom line, says Adcock, is that the sector is “in an absolute mess at the moment”. “They have reputations worth billions of pounds, but they put it at risk with an absolutely manic obsession with short-termism,” he says. “No one in supermarkets cares what next year looks like – they’re talking about the next six weeks.” Against all of this, the discounters like to set themselves up as revolutionary idealists. “We have a fundamentally different model,” Aldi said in a statement after the CMA report appeared. The idea, it went on, is to provide “the lowest prices in grocery in a simple and transparent way”. And, it’s true: when you visit Aldi or Lidl, the mood is different, the frantic discounting replaced by an agreeably spartan sense that supermarkets have been Ikea-ed. But even in these utopian surroundings all is not as it seems. “Go into the discounters and look at the price labels,” Phillip Adcock says. “We’re conditioned to look for the price on the shelf below the item. But, at the discounters, they put the prices on the shelf above, and the top shelf ones on the wall. So, you look and you see the price below, and you think that’s what you’re paying.” I’m sceptical about this. But, when I arrive at Lidl from Tesco, I see Adcock is absolutely right – and that, by accident or design, items tend to get cheaper as you go down the shelves, which means that by looking at the price below you think you’re getting a steal. As I absorb this latest piece of evil genius, and wonder how you are supposed to keep this stuff straight, a man who introduces himself as Dennis is picking a swede (79p) off the shelf directly above the white cabbage (45p). How much does he think it costs? He looks at me like I’m mad, then says: “It’s 45p, mate.” No! It’s not! Dennis looks again at the labels, and looks at the swede and shrugs. “Oh yeah,” he says. Then he puts it in his trolley and walks off. In the end, Dennis may have the right idea. For those on the tightest budgets, the pennies will add up to a critical difference at the checkout. But, for many others, the obsession it takes to beat the shops simply isn’t worth it. “What we really want,” says Caldwell, “is a psychological journey, these little moments of pleasure where we think we’ve got one over on the supermarket. That’s more important than the receipt at the end.” Leigh Caldwell is obsessed with prices. It’s his life’s work. And yet, he says: “I see myself falling for the tricks all the time. When I started learning about this stuff, my first reaction was, ‘Don’t be fooled – take your time to make the right decision.’ But I was taking so long that I was driving myself mad. So, I’ve taught myself to remember that, if it’s only a few pence, the ‘correct’ choice may not matter that much.” “The problem is,” he goes on, “we’re maybe expecting people to be too rational. It’s OK to say: ‘It’s not worth the hassle. I’m going to let it go.’” Tricks of the trade Unit confusionWhen items aren’t labelled with a consistent price per kilogram or litre, it can be difficult for consumers to tell which is better value. According to Which?, 87% of consumers are unaware of unit prices. Dodgy offersSometimes the price of an item mysteriously rises just as a “bargain” two-for-one offer comes in. For example, Asda lifted the price of frozen pizza from £1.50 to £2 as a “two for £3” offer appeared – and dropped the price again when the offer concluded. Pricy multipacksYou might expect a multipack to be better value, but sometimes – despite claiming to be “great value” – a larger pack may actually cost more per unit. One supermarket sold a 10-pack of toilet roll for more per roll than the same brand’s four-pack. Seasonal ‘bargains’Special products that only sell at one time of year might be sold at a steep price out of season to justify a “money off” designation. For example, Ocado sold an easter egg for £7.49 for 10 days in January, then priced it as “on offer” at £5. Shrinking packsCustomers don’t like having to pay more – but they might not notice getting slightly less for their money. So, a packet of Philadelphia cream cheese can shrink from 200g to 180g without any corresponding decrease in price. ‘Was’ pricing that wasn’tThere are examples of products sold at a higher price for a brief period before being sold at a “reduced” price for far longer, allowing the suggestion that it’s a good deal, or the price fluctuating so much that the term becomes meaningless. One supermarket sold handwash for £1.80 for a week, then labelled it as “Was £1.80, now 90p” for nearly three months.",2015-07-17T14:59:43Z,Food fight: the secrets of the supermarket price war,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""70182702be91dc5e5631bb72ee5957f42a07b41d""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/17/1437145013853/bb38ff43-6a2e-4e2e-b125-c5fa76da786d-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Tesco Extra store"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">When more products are sold as offers than not, are they really offers?</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Alex Segre/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>",96,"The world of grocery pricing is mysterious and highly competitive.

"“A good dinner is of importance to good talk,” Virginia Woolf writes in A Room of One’s Own. “One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well. The lamp in the spine does not light on beef and prunes.” Written in 1928, the context of this statement was provocative – Woolf was distraught at the substandard fare at a women’s college and viewed it as emblematic of institutionalised sexism – the penultimate sentence in this quote has been an axiom of sorts in our comparatively less begrimed era. On its own, Woolf’s famous sentence seems like more than just a nod to Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs: “dined” as opposed to “eaten” connotes pleasure, intent, and discernment. While plenty of writers throughout history would have been extraordinarily happy with a meal of beef and prunes, the word “well” can certainly mean whatever the modern writer prefers. I’m sure there exist many great books that were fuelled by whisky and Pop-Tarts.   Related: Kitchens of the Great Midwest by J Ryan Stradal review – carrot cake, coronaries and comedy    For great food writing, however, the lamp in our spine as readers demands more. The best food writing – about any kind of food – elevates it, recreates it, and broadens it with a keen sensory cubism. A great writer will make us hunger for things we’ve never eaten, conjure a consuming nostalgia from a list of ingredients, and make us feel like we’re dining well as we’re reading well. It was tough to narrow it down to 10, and I’m leaving out some great titles that you’ve already heard about, but here are a few favourites.  1. The Gastronomical Me by MFK Fisher “For the first years of my life, there was a series, every summer, of short but violently active cannings. Crates and baskets and lug-boxes of fruits bought in their prime and at their cheapest would lie waiting with opulent fragrance on the screened porch.” Fisher, a Michigan native whose lifelong passion for food, and food writing, was inspired by her early years in France , is the mother of modern mainstream food writing. Though some argue that her legacy has created a smothering, circumscribed sense of what constitutes the genre, there’s no arguing that her work is at its very foundation. 2. Pow! by Mo Yan “During the day they made meat-filled dumplings and rolled noodles to feed the Koreans; at night, after the restaurant closed, they cooked a pot of dog meat and opened a bowl of strong white liquor. Each of them held a dog’s leg – two legs out of the pot, and two more inside – with its bewitching aroma, waiting to be eaten.” Nobel prize winner Mo both retells his childhood in post-Cultural Revolution rural China as burlesque and critiques his country’s modern-day government in this surreal, wonderful, visceral novel set in a meat-obsessed town called Slaughterhouse Village. 3. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl “Many times a day, he would see other children taking creamy candy bars out of their pockets and munching them greedily; and that, of course, was pure torture.” One of my favourite books from childhood. Dahl conjured a world commensurate to the fantasies of many children, both in the justice meted out to Charlie’s ill-behaved peers and in the fantastic elements of the factory. I teach a workshop a couple times a year at an educational non-profit organisation called 826LA where I have elementary school students create a country from scratch – drawing the map, writing the laws, designing the flag and so on – and chocolate rivers and edible realms are amazingly common even among kids who haven’t been exposed to Dahl’s work. I hope one day for a comprehensive and unintentional revision.  4. Like Water For Chocolate by Laura Esquivel I first read this book in high school, and quickly realized that the adjectives “lush” and “sensual” evolved in speech to describe works such as this. The unusual structure, the fervid descriptions of food, the Mexican revolution setting, the sex, the violence, and aspects of magical realism in all of the above combined to blow my staid midwestern mind. 5. Cheap Novelties by Ben Katchor “In the past, Mr. Knipl had been forced, by circumstances, to watch this public display of a man’s need for cheap carbohydrates.” Katchor’s illustrated stories of solitary urban photographer Julius Knipl, who tacitly observes the author’s version of a mostly-vanished New York, are often preoccupied with the lonely city dweller’s relationship to food. Eating alone at cafes, calling for public mustard dispensers and bemoaning the lost moments of afflatus that followed a Bromo-Seltzer, Katchor’s protagonist is as much wonderer as wanderer – and between his experiences and conjecture lie a humorous and quietly profound survey of the overlooked aspects of the urban food experience.     Reckless and indulgent ... Anthony Bourdain. Photograph: Heathcliff O'Malley/REX    6. Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly by Anthony Bourdain “Good food is very often, even most often, simple food.”  At the time Bourdain’s first book came out, I don’t recall there being anything quite like it. His cynical, brash, and detailed look at the demanding milieu of restaurant kitchens and his often reckless and indulgent rise through the ranks is entertaining and revealing. For good reason, it helped make him a superstar. An essential title in contemporary food writing. 7. Beard on Bread by James Beard “Good bread and good butter go together. They are one of the perfect marriages in gastronomy, and they never fail to cheer me.” There’s a reason that this book is beloved by my characters Lars and Eva Thorvald – I love it. This is the first cookbook I found myself cracking open and reading as if it were a novel. 8. Good and Cheap by Leanne Brown “I designed these recipes to fit the budgets of people living on SNAP, the US programme that used to be called food stamps. If you’re on SNAP, you already know that the benefit formulas are complicated, but the rule of thumb is that you end up with $4 per person per day to spend on food. This book isn’t challenging you to live on so little; it’s a resource in case that’s your reality.” Leanne Brown’s guide on eating well for US$4 (£2.50) per day, available in print and as a free PDF, is one of a chorus of welcome retorts to the notion that one cannot eat both well and inexpensively. With recipes like Filipino Chicken Adobo, Spicy Broiled Tilapia with Lime, and Potato and Kale Rolls with Raita, along with suggestions for how to reinvent the leftovers, it’s a book for anyone. 9. Counter Intelligence: Where to Eat in the Real Los Angeles by Jonathan Gold “Los Angeles is the best place in the country to eat the cooking of Thailand and Burma, Guatemala and Ethiopia, Taiwan, and any of a dozen states of Mexico.” Dubbed “the high-low priest of the Los Angeles food scene” by Dana Goodyear in the New Yorker, there is arguably no other food critic that is as important to and revered by a city as Gold is to Los Angeles. Counter Intelligence, a compendium of his celebrated print series of the same name, captures everything that’s wonderful, wise, disarmingly informal, humorous, and discerning about the Pulitzer prize winner’s (the first ever for a food critic) work in one volume.  10. Honorable Mention: The Sun and Moon Guide to Eating Through Literature and Art “Put everything to a boil / over a slow fire / for five hundred years / and you’ll see what flavor it has.” – Claribel Alegria, Little Cambray Tamales Published in 1994, this wonderful anthology of original recipes, artwork, and previously published poems and excerpts captures, in a single volume, examples of food writing across a range of literary genres. With Samuel Beckett, Kathy Acker, Gabriel García Márquez, Ernest Hemingway, Junichiro Tanizaki, and many others.

"     Last month, what was perhaps the last great indie restaurant holdout from the great community-led reinvention of Covent Garden closed its doors. Food for Thought – started in the wake of Covent Garden’s demise as a working fruit-and-vegetable market – served vegetarian fare at affordable prices over more than four decades. Along the way, it become a London institution. But as the area’s cachet attracted deep-pocketed chain stores, rents began to skyrocket. The most recent rental increase would have forced Food for Thought to cut the living wages it pays to staff, and to nearly double what punters paid for a meal, says owner Vanessa Garrett. That in turn would have meant an entire swathe of the community shut out, which again in turn would have taken all the fun out of running the restaurant, she says.   Related: Food for Thought: the last vegetarian gasp of alternative Covent Garden    “What’s happening in Covent Garden is not any longer to our flavour,” she tells Roann Ghosh, whose short film explores the plight of the small business owner in what used to be a countercultural haven in central London. The aim, Garrett says, appears to be to turn it into “a sort of funked up Bond Street”. Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion",2015-08-12T11:01:20Z,'Covent Garden?

"It goes without saying that the world is rapidly urbanising. Global, national and local governments have to start anticipating how we will cater for 5 billion people living in cities in 2030 and how they will have access to nutritious foods in a sustainable manner. The UN predicts that over 60% of the world population will live in urban areas and that 90% of this growth will take place in low and middle-income countries. Although many local initiatives to improve urban food systems are happening, global development policy has only recently acknowledged the issue. This year’s UNGA will set the new sustainable development goals (SDGs) and will call to make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, offering an exciting opportunity to discuss the complex issue of urbanisation in a global policy framework. Today’s large cities are concentrated in the global south but the fastest growing urban agglomerations are medium and small cities and cities with less than 1 million inhabitants located in Asia and Africa.  Small cities can struggle with long term urban planning and fresh food supply, and national policies need to ensure the most vulnerable have access to nutritious foods. National urbanisation trends must be considered and urban policy makers need to take city size into account and anticipate what challenges each city might face.  Larger cities must deal with how to make overburdened infrastructure more efficient while smaller cities will have to plan the most effective way to implement new infrastructure to reach those most in need.  Change is happening; Milan in collaboration with thirty other cities including London, New York, Amsterdam, Dakar, Hanoi, Maputo and Shanghai has initiated the creation of an “Urban Food Policy Pact” as part of the Expo Milan 2015. Many cities have already begun implementing comprehensive municipal food policies. A peri-urban farming ring around the mega city of Shanghai provides over 50% of the city’s vegetables. The local government of Belo Horizonte created public restaurants that sell affordable and nutritious food. These city initiatives are a strong starting place, however local municipal policies are not enough. Many countries, especially low and middle-income countries (LMICs), will become increasingly reliant on food imports. Food trade makes the most at risk populations more vulnerable to global price increases. For low income families this means that they can be forced to substitute their diet with cheaper bulk foods that have little or no nutritious value. National and international governments must take into account urban food systems when planning agricultural policies and international trade policies.  This issue is further complicated by climate change. Making food systems more resilient must become a crucial component of urban food policy. One area to look at is post-harvest loss. We need to make sure we waste less, distribute better and in some circumstances re-purpose what could have been waste. Urban policy and planning of efficient infrastructure must take food systems such as storage and transport into account to enable the access and affordability of fresh foods.  Urban food deserts have been an increasingly important concern in high income countries such as the US where supermarkets have retreated from low-income areas, closing downtown stores and opening mega-stores on the urban periphery. The disappearance of local supermarkets has made access to healthy and affordable foods more difficult. In Africa food deserts take on a different form. Food deserts in Africa would be characterised as urban neighbourhoods with high food insecurity with a mix of formal supermarkets and informal food markets - existing side by side but nutritious food still remains limited. These urban food deserts may have previously been ignored because food security and undernutrition has often been seen as a rural issue rather than an urban one in the development agenda.  It is vital urban planning takes context-specific consumer and private sector trends into the picture. Regulation to increase access is one step governments can take. This should include working with informal retailers such as street vendors as well as anticipating the growth of supermarkets and ensuring the nutritional quality and affordability of products is increased.  We need to continually be proactive to address how food systems are going to adapt to demographic shifts especially in Asia and Africa where most of the urban growth will continue to evolve. The regulatory environment has a key role to play at this critical juncture in time and must address key issues of sustainability and ensure the most vulnerable populations don’t get left behind.

"“Phish Food” and “Coconut Seven Layer Bar” are just some of the flavors that Eric Fredette, one of Ben &amp; Jerry’s six in-house “flavor gurus” – his actual job title – has helped add to the ice cream maker’s collection. Now in his 18th year with the Vermont-based company, Fredette remains equally as passionate about the culinary arts as for creating eclectic, delicious flavors with layers and depth. His team call Fredette “the angry chef”, because he speaks directly on what he does and doesn’t like. “My filter is broken and I don’t hold a lot inside – that’s a good thing,” he says. “Everybody always knows my thoughts on the situation.” Fredette adores food and cares about the overall experience for customers. Take the “Salted Caramel” flavor for instance. “With every bite, you can choose a little bit of caramel and a lot of ice cream, or a little bit of ice cream and a lot of caramel. Each bite is customized to be perfect for you,” Fredette says. He also feels strongly on why certain flavors – such as “Boston Cream Pie”, which launched in 2010 as a tribute to the Massachusetts state dessert – don’t belong in his new Cores line. “To make ‘Boston Cream Pie’ work as a Cores ice cream, we’d have to make the custard filling chewy, which wouldn’t work. This would deliver on taste, but not on the overall custard experience.” Inspiration in odd places The desire to get the flavor right comes partly from Ben &amp; Jerry’s fans – Fredette and his teammates, Peter Lind, Chris Rivard and Kristin Schimoler, receive over 13,000 flavor suggestions annually. They also receive reviews – both positive and negative. “Our fans are good, they know their favorite flavor, and if we change something as simple as the vanilla supplier and it’s not a perfect match, we hear about it and then fix it,” Fredette says.      Ice cream is an emulsion combining liquids – at Ben &amp; Jerry’s, the liquids are cane syrup, skim milk and heavy cream. Photograph: Ben &amp; Jerry's    Making new ice creams isn’t easy. Ice cream is an emulsion combining liquids – at Ben &amp; Jerry’s the liquids are cane syrup, skim milk and heavy cream – which typically don’t mix well together, according to the American Chemical Society. Rivard says developing new ice cream flavors typically take 12 months from concept to getting the flavor on store shelves. Schimoler adds that while much of the work requires ice cream tasting, paperwork on specifications, manufacturing regulations, and securing consistency and food safety, the job also requires creative brainstorming in coming up with interesting flavors.  Fredette and his team gain inspiration for new flavors everywhere – from magazines, social media, even the Vermont landscape. “Sometimes it’s a color, a cool name, or most likely, a cool ingredient or combo on a menu,” Fredette says. “Packaging, oddly enough, like a shampoo bottle or stick of deodorant, can inspire a cool new twist.”  To keep abreast with flavor trends, the “flavor gurus” often travel to different cities to explore food culture. “We eat a lot of things in a very short period of time, then we pitch our ideas to the marketing team, order the products, the ingredients and start making it,” says Fredette, who doubts he could find a better job.  “I like playing with food, and they pay me. It’s awesome.” Content on this page is brought to you by Ben &amp; Jerry’s, sponsor of the Climate change: too hot to handle hub.",2015-08-11T13:00:03Z,Meet the chef behind Ben & Jerry's oddball flavors,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""96e46bab365ab96dc3c11d3a4d084af279daa5b9""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/96e46bab365ab96dc3c11d3a4d084af279daa5b9/0_166_4680_2808/1000.jpg"" alt=""Eric Fredette, one of Ben &amp; Jerry’s six in-house “flavor gurus”."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Eric Fredette, one of Ben &amp; Jerry’s six in-house “flavor gurus”.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Ben &amp; Jerry's</span> </figcaption> </figure>",100,"Eric Fredette and fellow chefs Peter Lind, Chris Rivard and Kristin Schimoler help create the 63 flavors in Ben &amp; Jerry’s pint collection",http://media.guim.co.uk/96e46bab365ab96dc3c11d3a4d084af279daa5b9/0_166_4680_2808/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/ben-jerrys-partner-zone/2015/aug/10/eric-fredette-ben-jerrys-oddball-flavors-ice-cream-phish-food,8,positive
