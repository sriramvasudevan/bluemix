"I was deeply saddened to read in the Scotsman this week the results of a survey of LGBT people living in Scotland. Despite excellent advances in civil rights, an overwhelming majority reported experiencing bullying and physical assaults in either school, the workplace or in the communities in which they lived. This is surprising as Scotland led the way on gay marriage. It was also the first part of the UK to repeal the draconian Thatcherite policy Section 28. As Ian McKellen once said of it at a Stonewall event, “It was simply throwing red meat to the lions”. The policy led to increased homophobia and put an end to funding for many support schemes throughout the UK that helped young people struggling with their sexuality, as well as many cultural projects to help raise awareness. Scotland, using the new powers promised by Labour at the time and without a House of Lords, repealed the clause almost instantly when Tony Blair came to power. This was an emotional time for gay people of my generation, as depicted in the wonderfully warm crowd-pleasing film Pride, which was based on a community not too dissimilar to mine.    As a teenager I was spat on each day. With 'queer' chalked on the back of my blazer, kids shouted abuse outside my home.    Another political irony concerns the Stagecoach founder Brian Souter, one of Scotland’s wealthiest businessmen – and a major SNP donor. In 2000 Souter embarked on a personal crusade to uphold Section 28. Thanks to the campaign there were huge billboards scattered all over Edinburgh featuring a picture of a doe-eyed infant and the caption “Protect Our Children and Keep the Clause”. This did nothing but harm to LGBT Scots, fuelling ignorance and prejudice in a beautiful but often parochial Scotland, best described by Irvine Welsh as a complex mix of “Calvinism, Catholicism, alcoholism and bad weather”. I have been a Londoner for some 25 years and still visit my hometown in Scotland regularly. I support the SNP and I supported the case for independence. Last summer, when taking part in a Channel 4 referendum special in Edinburgh, I felt sick when I saw Souter sitting on the same side as me as I knew I was going to have to say something to him. I told him his actions had contributed to making the lives of many gay people miserable, especially the young, and added to their sense of persecution and alienation. As a teenager I was spat on each day. With “queer” chalked on the back of my blazer, kids waited outside my home shouting abuse. Eventually I was sent to a psychiatric unit for counselling about my sexuality and was reliant on diazepam by the age of 17 to quell my anxiety. I spoke from a weary, battle-worn heart when I confronted Souter – at almost 50 I am tired of fighting for all these years. Souter insisted that he never wanted to hurt anyone. He explained that he was a Christian man who believed in protecting family values but he was deeply sorry for any hurt that he had caused. I can imagine that the SNP are keen to forget this matter and I do not bring it up to sling political mud at a movement I support, but it needs to be acknowledged. Perhaps the decision to book Karen Dunbar, a talented performer who happens to be a lesbian, to host the Commonwealth games opening ceremony in Glasgow, which also featured John Barrowman kissing a man, sent a message that Scotland was supporting its LGBT community and that it was time to embrace a more modern Scotland. Yet the results of this week’s survey show just how much gestures like this are still desperately needed. More funding for work in schools around LGBT acceptance, more work around bullying, more role models for the young who are prepared to stand up and be counted in all walks of public life and, above all, more funding for the arts, which in all its forms offers an injection of soul into our lives. Through such actions, LGBT people in Scotland may find the happiness that sadly continues to escape them because of their struggle for acceptance.",2015-07-22T14:54:25Z,Scotland once led the way on gay rights.

"Democrats plan to unveil an expansive anti-discrimination bill that would give LGBT people employment, housing and education protections. The bill, which Democrats say will be introduced in the Senate and House, would extend protections granted under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to LGBT people, according to the Advocate, which received an early copy of the proposed legislation.  It is being sponsored in the Senate by Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Cory Booker of New Jersey. The lead sponsor in the house is David Cicilline, of Rhode Island, who outlined the plans in a letter to other legislators, where he requested co-sponsors for the bill.  “In most states, a same-sex couple can get married on Saturday, post pictures on Facebook on Sunday, and then risk being fired from their job or kicked out of their apartment on Monday,” said Cicilline’s letter. “A majority of states in our country do not have laws that protect LGBT individuals against discrimination.” With Republicans in control of both chambers, passing the bill into law is a steep uphill battle. Currently, the GOP is pushing a bill called the First Amendment Defense Act – which would limit how much action the government could take against individuals and businesses who want to deny services to LGBT people.  Supporters say that the legislation was introduced in response to the June supreme court decision that made same-sex marriage legal across the United States. The laundry list of protections LGBT people would be given under the Democrat-backed legislation demonstrates just some of the ways they can be discriminated against in states and cities that do not provide such protections. The current bill would prevent people from denying their LGBT counterparts a range of services and activities, because of their sexuality; from stopping those seeking to discriminate against LGBT people hoping to purchase homes, to making it illegal to keep LGBT people off of juries. Cicilline said these “explicit, consistent protections” would also grant anti-discrimination protections for LGBT people in public education, the workplace and public accommodations. The Human Rights Campaign president, Chad Griffin, supports the proposed legislation.  “There is an unacceptable patchwork of state-level protections for LGBT people, and more than half of LGBT Americans live in a state that lacks fully inclusive non-discrimination laws,” Griffin said in a statement. “The time has come in this country for full, federal equality, and nothing less.” This plan follows a landmark decision by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that said it is illegal to discriminate against gay, lesbian and bisexual people in the workplace under the Civil Rights Act. The 1964 act forbid discrimination on the basis of sex, race and national origin in schools, at work and in public places. While employers do not have to follow the agency’s ruling, it sets an important precedent for future discrimination cases.",2015-07-21T17:36:31Z,LGBT anti-discrimination bill aims to extend Civil Rights Act protections,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""8c3ec5bb7a8e734d861a4cf25ac425395d9fa782""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/8c3ec5bb7a8e734d861a4cf25ac425395d9fa782/0_9_5141_3089/1000.jpg"" alt=""LGBT parade"" width=""1000"" height=""601"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Parade viewers at an LGBT pride parade in Seattle, Washington.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Elaine Thompson/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>",1,"Democrats in Congress to introduce legislation that would give LGBT people employment, housing and education protections, but passage could be difficult",http://media.guim.co.uk/8c3ec5bb7a8e734d861a4cf25ac425395d9fa782/0_9_5141_3089/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/21/lgbt-anti-discrimination-bill-civil-rights,7
"   Related: Gay marriage is ready to be legal across America. The culture war is far from over    As the US supreme court’s decision on whether states can enforce bans on same-sex marriage moves to the oral arguments stage on Tuesday, LGBT activists are getting ready to face a more aggressive campaign to diminish their rights. Concern is highest in places like Idaho, one of 13 states where a person can be in a same-sex marriage, but can also be fired for being gay.  “People are worried that if they do get married, then they can then lose their job for getting married,” said Jess McCafferty, education and outreach coordinator at the American Civil Liberties Union of Idaho. In several of the state’s major cities, campaigners such as the ACLU have successfully pushed for municipal ordinances that offer protection from such a situation – but Idaho has a large rural population that remains unprotected and its powerful conservative government is not inclined to pick up such laws statewide.       For the past 10 years, LGBT advocates in the state have been pushing Idaho to do just that – and grant state protections to people based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Such legislation was finally made the subject of a hearing in January, but a House of Representatives committee blocked the so-called Add the Words bill the day after the testimony ended.  One of hundreds to testify about the experience of being a gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender resident of Idaho was Christine Antonio, the mother of a transgender teenager. “My stomach lurches when I think about his prospects in a place where just being different is still frowned upon,” Antonio said. “We do not expect everyone to understand him, but we do except that he is treated with dignity and acceptance.”  The more conservative people in the state tend to accept that same-sex couples exist, McCafferty said, but did not necessarily support that relationship being state-approved. She described the attitude as: “It’s OK if this guy is a queer, but they’re not getting married.” She and other advocates are expecting a more aggressive push by lawmakers for more so-called “religious freedom” ordinances.  In 2000, Idaho enacted its version of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a bill that forces the government to prove that it has a “compelling interest” in infringing on a religious person’s beliefs.  It resembles the controversial legislation passed in Indiana last month which Governor Mike Pence was pushed to amend to show that it did not create a pathway to discrimination after receiving tremendous global pushback. Even with the RFRA in place, Idaho lawmakers are introducing bills that would protect the type of discrimination opponents to state “religious freedom” laws are concerned about, such as allowing businesses to refuse service on religious grounds.    Map: where you can get fired for being gay   Idaho’s textbook intersection of these rights and same-sex marriage is part of an ongoing case in the state’s second-largest city, Coeur d’Alene. After same-sex marriage became legal in Idaho in October 2014, owners of the Hitching Post chapel said that they were warned that they would be running afoul of the law if they refused to host same-sex weddings.  The Hitching Post’s owners filed suit and are represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal group that has been involved with many recent religious freedom cases and opposed Idaho’s Add the Words bill.  “We’re receiving more calls and litigating more than ever before,” said Greg Scott, an ADF spokesman.  Scott said ADF believes that there “is never a bad time to provide more religious freedom”. The group pushes for more of those freedoms by representing people like the Hitching Post owners and working with legislators pushing religious freedom bills.  “The only people whose freedom is on the line are the people who are being told by the government that unless you bow, you will be stamped out or you will face severe punishment,” Scott said.  Tom Nestor, the executive of director of youth LGBT center All Under One Roof, was born and raised in Idaho. He created the center, which is in the south-eastern town of Pocatello, after a bullied, gay teenager in the city killed himself.  Nestor is concerned about how accepted LGBT teens feel in the community, but believes that people 30 and under are becoming more accepting of the community, even in rural Idaho. “I don’t think there are a lot of people that age that really cares if you’re gay or whatever, as long as you are a decent person,” Nestor said.  He is less concerned about whether same-sex couples have the right to marry and more concerned that LGBT people feel accepted and protected in their community.  “I really wish Idaho would add the words, and then people wouldn’t have to be in fear of losing their house or something because of being gay or straight or transexual or whatever,” Nestor said.  This fear was highlighted during the Add the Words testimony. Erin Nelson, a Boise resident, said that she spoke to the committee on behalf of the people who cannot speak publicly because of the lack of protections offered to the LGBT community.  “They can’t be here today because they run the risk of being outed in their workplaces,” Nelson said. “They can’t because being outed could result in the loss of their jobs, their homes and their lives.”",2015-04-26T04:00:03Z,Beyond gay marriage: Idaho LGBT advocates battle legal discrimination,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""b562876af6f7407528410e001d842d4cd6448078""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/23/1429809144151/667b34d6-052c-4ab8-a747-114dfa243a0c-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""lgbt flag gay marriage"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">As the supreme court prepares to decide on whether states can ban gay marriage, Idaho activists seek basic protections for the LGBT community under state law.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: David Poller/Zuma Press/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>",2,Activists are pushing to ‘add the words’ of LGBT inclusion to protections law in a state where same-sex couples can marry but also be fired for being gay,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/23/1429809144434/667b34d6-052c-4ab8-a747-114dfa243a0c-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/26/idaho-lgbt-gay-marriage-discrimination-religious-freedom,7
"When Arizona lawmakers wanted businesses to be able to choose whether to serve LGBT customers based on the religious convictions of their owners, there was a national outcry. Especially, it seemed, from the business community.  The National Football League threatened to move the Super Bowl. The Arizona Cardinals football team sent a letter condemning the law. Wells Fargo, Apple, Bank of America, Marriott and American Express all criticized the bill.  In Michigan, an analogous act met the same fate. Business leaders who had originally come together to add LGBT protections to the state’s civil rights law ended up fighting against a religious freedom bill introduced in response.  “By not having inclusive policies we’re contributing to brain-drain,” said Sommer Foster, director of political advocacy at Equality Michigan. “We were able to get a number of CEOs to sign on and say discrimination doesn’t represent Michigan values.”  But now in Arkansas, where a bill to stop municipalities from passing ordinances to protect the LGBT community is almost certain to become law, national business leaders are keeping mum.  “It’s been pretty quiet so far, unfortunately,” said Laura Phillips, board member and advocacy chair at the Northwest Arkansas Center for Equality, a small nonprofit based in Fayetteville, about the reaction from the business community. “It’s frankly kind of distressing that there’s been that much silence.”  In Arkansas, a governor neither has to sign or veto legislation for it to become law – if the governor takes no action for five days, the bill is considered approved. This, governor Asa Hutchinson has said, is the path he will take.  LGBT leaders are attempting to organize against the governor’s inaction, gathering signatures and urging constituents to call and email the governor’s office, but they say the silence from business leaders is conspicuous.  “We are just really surprised,” said Lamont Richie, president of the Eureka Springs Gay Business Guild, about what is perceived among activists as a failure on Walmart’s part to speak up. The retail giant is the state’s largest employer and a vocal proponent of LGBT rights. The company has a strong internal anti-discrimination policy, and has sponsored events like the New York City Pride parade. “I don’t know what’s happening in back rooms – I wish I was privy to that.”  The Arkansas state chamber of commerce has also refused to comment.  While Arizona’s chamber of commerce and industry condemned that state legislature’s attempt to codify a religious freedom bill, the Arkansas state chamber of commerce CEO relayed a message to the Guardian through a secretary: the chamber has no opinion. Walmart did not respond to requests for comment.  Arkansas is not unique in its failure to protect the LGBT community from housing and employment discrimination. (It is the latter that typically draws criticism from the business community, which says such laws hinder attempts to attract talent.) In all, 29 states don’t protect members of the LGBT community through anti-discrimination statutes. The failure is one of omission. Unless states spell out protections on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, there are none.  In the face of states’ failure to act, more than 200 municipalities across the country have passed anti-discrimination ordinances. Most recently, a West Virginia town of just five residents agreed to enact such an ordinance.  And in Arkansas the same phenomenon was happening. The Fayetteville city council may have inadvertently inspired the bill with a non-discrimination ordinance it passed – local LGBT leaders say the state bill’s sponsor, Republican state senator Bart Hester, commented on the Fayetteville ordinance even though the center of his district is more than 120 miles away. (Voters repealed Fayetteville’s ordinance by referendum last December, but that didn’t deter Hester.)  The state senator fast-tracked the law, part of an effort to ensure that the LGBT community did not have “special rights that I do not have”, Hester told BuzzFeed News. The bill now sitting on Hutchinson’s desk was less than two weeks old when it was passed by both houses of the Arkansas general assembly.  “Any time a state legislature makes a special effort to squash the ability of a local community to say that it doesn’t want to discriminate against the LGBT community, I think that’s a pretty astounding political statement,” said Rebecca Isaacs, executive director of the Equality Federation.  “Senate Bill 202 passed with significant margins in the General Assembly, and I have a high regard for the discussion in the legislature and respect for the legislative process,” Hutchinson told the Arkansas Times in a statement. “As Governor, I recognize the desire to prevent burdensome regulations on businesses across the state. However, I am concerned about the loss of local control. For that reason, I am allowing the bill to become law without my signature.” The bill was altered only to remove an “emergency” provision that would have made it effective immediately upon approval. Now, if the bill becomes law, it will take effect 90 days after the legislative session ends. That’s likely to be sometime this summer because the Arkansas legislature often extends its session.  Eureka Springs claims to have the only active LGBT anti-discrimination ordinance in the state, though LGBT activists said they are attempting to inspire others to pass similar laws.  “I have yet to receive one contact from the chamber of commerce, or any business in the area, asking any questions about the ordinance,” said Richie, one of the Eureka Springs ordinance’s architects and strongest proponents. “It’s rather disturbing but at the same time. “It’s not surprising – this is Arkansas.”  This article was updated on February 18 2015 to correct the name of the Equality Federation.

"As state after state makes same-sex marriage legal, it’s easy to be placated by the notion that we’re nearing true equality. For heterosexual cisgender people, marriage equality has become a self-congratulatory rallying point, a string of victories we point at to prove that things can, in fact, get better. We love the wedding pictures and the joy of excited couples together for decades who are finally able to get married. But let’s not make it rain celebratory rice just yet. Marriage equality is far from the only indicator of how well we’re doing in tackling LGBT issues, and, despite some policy hurdles we’ve surmounted, homophobia in all its forms remains a pervasive force in LGBT people’s daily lives – even in so-called progressive enclaves. Last year a lesbian couple said they were kicked out of a cab in Oregon by a bigoted driver (the same thing happened to a Chicago couple in 2013 and a London couple on New Years Eve) In 2014, a gay couple was beaten up by a homophobic mob in Philadelphia, and a gay man was badly injured in an attack on a subway platform in the middle of New York’s Greenwich Village the same year. Trans people - trans women, in particular - are attacked and murdered with alarming regularity, yet their deaths rarely make national news. Despite headway on policies ranging from non-discrimination to same-sex marriage, legislative successes do not always translate into tangible changes in LGBT people’s daily lives. Marriage equality may have persevered in Alabama, for example - but the win was in name only, thanks to a court order instructing probate judges not to give out licenses to same-sex couples. In a move that the Human Rights Campaign called “a pathetic, last-ditch attempt at judicial fiat” by a man with a personal agenda, KKK-approved Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy S Moore sent out a letter to halt same-sex marriages, citing the state constitution’s “Sanctity of Marriage Amendment”, which says marriage is only between a man and a woman. Judges across the state are following his order and denying couples marriage licenses. As my colleague Steven Thrasher wrote, marriage equality in states like Alabama is “only a step forward in a fight for equality which may go on for years or decades to come”. The right to marry is just one small piece of a much broader fight against the structural and social systems that reenforce inequality. And as much as we’d like to think this country has changed, we still have a long road ahead of us to make LGBT equality a reality. Just this month, for example, a poll found that while Americans support marriage equality, a majority also support a wedding business’ right to refuse services to same-sex couples. The idea that our work ending this hatred is nearing an end is a seductive one, but it’s a lie. If we care about ending all forms of discrimination and hatred against LGBT people, we’ll support those fighting not just for marriage, but also for better access to health care, food security, affordable housing and immigrants’ rights. Sharing pictures of happy newlywed gay couples on the internet is nice, but not nearly enough.",2015-02-12T19:53:38Z,Marriage equality didn't end homophobia.

"When Jennifer Rambo got engaged in Arkansas last year, she wasn’t an activist seeking to make history. But when a temporary court ruling made way for her nuptials, her fiancee “didn’t want to miss the opportunity”. So they moved up their wedding date, and Jennifer and Kristin Seaton-Rambo did end up making history, as the first gay couple married in this former heart of the confederacy when it became the first southern US state to allow same-sex marriage – albeit for just a week in May. “Now that we’ve been all over the news,” Jennifer told the Guardian last week, she is concerned about her sexual orientation being used against her when she graduates from university and begins looking for work. More immediately, she is concerned for her family, whom she feared could be “discriminated against just for being seen being supportive of us”. Such is life being out in the American south, where discrimination exacts a daily toll, and especially in Arkansas, where a circuitous route to LGBT equality now appears to be operating in reverse as anti-gay legislation pushes already vulnerable citizens further to the margins.   Related: As gay marriage bans fall, LGBT rights come under fire from state legislatures    As of last week, it is legal in Arkansas not to protect against LGBT discrimination in the workplace. Officially, Senate Bill 202 forbids localities from passing civil-protections ordinances for traits not already covered by law, such as race, gender or religion. But since Arkansas’s civil-rights laws – like those in most US states – do not include protections for LGBT citizens from being discriminated in employment, education or housing, the new law stopped even local governments from offering any such protections when Governor Asa Hutchinson declined to veto it. “The federal government understands we have certain rights, but our fucking state wants to strip them away,” said Kenny Abner, who works for a healthcare provider. Looking down the bar at Six Ten, one of the very few gay watering holes in Little Rock, Arkansas’s biggest city, Abner says Republicans, who normally champion local control, have “suddenly forgotten that”. “No one seemed to see this backlash coming,” says his friend, Cornelius Mabin, from across the bar. Mabin says he is worried about how the bill will affect HIV/Aids, given how dangerous the disease is across the American south even before SB 202 added to what Mabin called “the racism, homophobia and stigma we already face”. “My straight friends are appalled,” Abner said. “This is not a gay thing. It’s a rights thing.” A gay man who asked not to be named described working as an aircraft manufacturing technician in a “blue-collar environment”. The man said if he was totally out, colleagues and superiors would “question my integrity, which would make them question my integrity in my job”. Other LGBT Arkansans said they are confident in a future with full-on marriage equality and anti-discrimination policies from major corporations. (Walmart came out against SB 202, but the Arkansas-based retailer did not use its considerable political influence as the largest private employer in the country until after the law passed.) But they remain concerned that legislators here and across the American south were declaring a quiet war on queer Arkansans working for locally owned businesses, or without access to any work or even shelter at all – indeed, against people whose very gender identity makes them likely victims of violence.     19 Kids and Counting stars Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar helped to defeat the Fayetteville measure. Photograph: Wikimedia Commons    A pattern for big-footing civil rights, from the Duggars to the statehouses Just three months after Arkansas started and stopped handing out marriage licenses to LGBT couples last year, Fayetteville – a college town that is also home to thousands of employees from Walmart’s nearby headquarters – passed a landmark non-discrimination ordinance of its own. One impetus for passing the local measure, said Fayetteville city council member Mark Kinion, was to make sure all LGBT citizens enjoyed the kinds of employment protections he was afforded at the pharmaceutical manufacturer SmithKline before he retired. But Kinion, who is openly gay, said his employer’s protections were “limited”, that there was “still discrimination” on the job, and that Fayetteville’s ordinance went beyond the workplace and extended to “everyone, especially the transgender community”. “One of the most heinous murders we ever had was of a black transgender lady, who was beaten to death by a hammer so severely there was tissue from one side of the house to the other,” Kinoin said, referring to the 1998 death of Rita Hester. Local government should be focusing, he said, on protecting LGBT people not just at the workplace but “for their safety, for their very lives”.  Fayetteville citizens overturned the city council’s anti-discrimination measure by a direct vote in December, aided by a high-profile political push from the Duggars, the family behind the wildly popular reality show 19 Kids and Counting. Now that the legislature in Little Rock has banned every locality like Fayetteville from passing similar protections statewide, a pattern for big-footing civil rights has been set: anti-discrimination rollbacks are in the works inside statehouses from Kansas to Florida, and citizens across the Bible belt are concerned that conservative state legislators won’t let localised efforts get in their way. A model for doubling down on discrimination, from the Bible to the basement In the basement of Little Rock’s First Presbyterian Church, 18-year-old Violet Gresham and 17-year-old Savannah Rayne spend a lot of time at Diverse Youth for Social Change, a group that creates a safe space for young queer people to hang out and create their own programs. It is part of the Center for Artistic Revolution, which also maintains a clothing closet in the basement, for young trans people to pick up bras, binders or gender-appropriate fashion.     Violet Gresham.    Gresham, who identifies as transgender, has been largely successful in getting teachers to use the name “Violet” and the pronoun “they”. But Gresham is concerned that the word “it” might be used more frequently about a human being, if a religious exemption bill – separate from the anti-discrimination bill that became law last week – allows teachers and employers to claim their beliefs as a reason for discriminating against LGBT people. Last Wednesday at the Little Rock statehouse, the Arkansas state senate’s judiciary committee did not endorse the sweeping religious “conscience protection” bill, known as HB 1228, after it passed the Arkansas house.

"The past few years have been remarkable for gay rights in the US. Well over half of the states now recognise same‑sex marriage and Oregon is the first state to elect an out bisexual state governor. With so many positive forces at play shouldn’t it be expected that the annual St Patrick’s Day parade in New York City would embrace gay marchers? Apparently not. With a history stretching back 250 years and around two million spectators attending each year, the 5th Avenue parade is a huge event in the city’s, and the country’s, cultural calendar. However, it has been mired in allegations of discrimination for decades because the organising committee, part of a private business that has a licence from the city to run the parade, has repeatedly refused to permit lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans (LGBT) groups to march on equal terms alongside people from other Irish American organisations, ranging from police officers to pipers. Last year, the new Democratic mayor of NYC, Bill de Blasio, refused to participate, as did a number of city council members, because of the exclusion of gay groups. Along with two of the biggest sponsors of the official parade, Guinness and Heineken, pulling out, this was seen by campaigners as a sign that things might be changing for the better. Six months later a concession was announced confirming that one LGBT group would be taking part in 2015 (a workplace group at one of the event’s biggest sponsors, NBC, Out@NBCUniversal). LGBT campaigners protested that this clearly did not constitute full inclusion and they renewed a long-standing boycott, as did many local politicians. Activist Emmaia Gelman, a member of the group Irish Queers, who has been advocating for full inclusion for 20 years, says there “was absolutely no consultation between the parade’s organisers and the groups campaigning” before selecting the NBC group. The organisers said there was “no room” this year for further LGBT groups but that they could reapply in “future years”. However, they insisted that gay groups would not be able to march under a banner identifying them as LGBT. This remains unacceptable, says Gelman. A supreme court ruling of 20 years ago upholds the right of private parades to prevent gay groups marching but, as Gelman says, it doesn’t mean they have to. “The parade organisers now reiterate that Irish LGBT people can only march if they are not identifiable – in other words, as long as they remain invisible in the Irish community – and that no end to the exclusion is planned. The ban on Irish LGBT groups remains in place,” she says. Yet, permitting even one LGBT group to march has proved too much for some. The Catholic League, a group staunchly opposed to gay participation, declared it was withdrawing from this year’s parade claiming that the organisers had reneged on a promise to include a “pro-life” group if a gay group was marching. As other St Patrick’s Day events around the US have embraced diversity and inclusion, the New York official parade’s stance has become all the more anachronistic. An annual alternative, the St Pat’s for All parade in the New York borough of Queens, takes place on 1 March. Kerry Kennedy, daughter of Robert F Kennedy and president of the Robert F Kennedy Centre for Justice and Human Rights, has been confirmed as one of two grand marshals at the Queens parade. She describes the official 5th Avenue parade’s inclusion policies as a throwback. Kennedy says the grassroots, community event is an example of a genuinely inclusive parade. With all the progressive changes on gay rights, it is still shocking that the parades controversy persists, says Kennedy. “The LGBT community is an unfortunate annual reminder of how far society still has to go.” Whatever you think of St Patrick’s Day and its parades wherever they are, the one thing they absolutely should not be is an excuse for discrimination.",2015-02-24T14:00:06Z,St Patrick’s Day is no excuse for discrimination,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""ce135ffab4ee8a2820146639ffebe33a0c96adac""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/20/1424460383258/St-Patricks-day-parade-Ne-005.jpg"" alt=""St Patrick's day parade, New York"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">New York city’s St Patrick’s Day Parade is being boycotted by gay, lesbian and transgender groups as they are not being allowed to march under an LGBT banner.

"Diversity is a challenge for the construction sector. The assets we build and services we provide impact everyone in society. Roads do not discriminate against lesbians who drive, and power turns on if gay men flick switches. Despite this, those who build the nation’s infrastructure are disproportionately white, straight and male. There is little effort to change the make-up of the workforce (most of which does not wear make-up). The site environment can be hostile for anyone who doesn’t “fit in”. According to a Construction Industry Training Board survey published in April this year, 48% of people experience homophobic language on sites every year, with 11% hearing it at least once a week. Most managers would never intentionally discriminate, saying: “It doesn’t matter if you’re different, I treat everyone the same”. My answer is: “It doesn’t matter to you, but it certainly matters to me!” People seem afraid to engage with difference, but we must move to a world where we champion inclusiveness, not sameness. Most people would never believe they would make biased hiring or promotion decisions. However, the imagery and behaviours set by organisations can keep people away in the first place or demotivate them when they arrive. The sector clearly discriminates in favour of white, straight men. Otherwise, why would it self-perpetuate given that they are not the majority of British society? We asked Balfour Beatty staff to self-identify as LGBT in employee surveys in 2014. These surveys show LGBT is roughly 50% under-represented.  This means we are missing out on talent working in other sectors. It is likely that LGBT individuals are joining the sector and remaining or going back into the closet. Empirical evidence by Stonewall proves that openly LGBT staff are more effective when supported by their employer, but we don’t need a study to know when we feel excluded we don’t go the extra mile. People coming from the same background can behave like a club. Clubs like members who obey the rules. If you don’t obey the rules you have to assimilate or you are kicked out. But what happens if the club’s rules don’t make sense anymore? If everyone believes one truth, then you could be on the Titanic believing it’s an unsinkable ship. Diversity in boardrooms allows for more challenge and therefore better thinking – why shouldn’t this apply in a building site or project context? Because of our different life experience, LGBT people are often outside the club. Therefore, it might be worth your while listening to what we have to say, even if it makes you uncomfortable. There are many actions that can be taken by the sector to address these issues. Inspire staff to be role models and give them the time to inspire others. Tell stories about individuals who do not fit the mould so others don’t feel isolated. Create network groups so LGBT staff can discuss issues in a safe place. Straight allies can participate in these networks and share experiences. It’s about harnessing passion and using it for the better good. Change your imagery and language. Think about making your websites and documents more diverse, but not tokenistic. Adopt a “no bystander” policy to encourage and reward people for actively standing up against those who exhibit offensive behaviour (innocently or intentionally). Make an example of people that don’t change. Diverse organisations only work if they are inclusive. It’s no use having a diverse group of people who shout at each other like a bad night in the Big Brother house. Ensure an inclusive culture by having clear policies, processes, and ways of working. I am currently promoting a diversity code of practice for the infrastructure sector, setting out the sector’s commitment to diversity. It includes a proposal that, in every public or regulated infrastructure tender, employers should score contractors on their diversity commitment. Contractors take tender scoring very seriously, so this could really drive effective change. Separately, I am working with Stonewall to create a sector-wide LGBT network to alleviate the problem of running networks in SMEs where staff numbers might not make them sustainable. If the sector works together in adopting these measures, hopefully construction can become just another great place for LGBT people to work.

"Ignoring corporate pressure over “divisive” and potentially outright anti-LGBT discrimination, Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal has enacted another of the controversial “religious freedom” measures that have been sweeping conservative states. Earlier this year in Indiana and Arkansas, governors have amended so-called RFRA laws – or abandoned them all together – in response to concerns from companies as huge as Apple and as locally dominant as Walmart that they would effectively allow businesses to shut out gay customers. But Jindal, who announced this week that he had launched a presidential exploratory committee, signed an executive order after the Louisiana state legislature shelved an RFRA-like bill that is opposed by major businesses across the country and vital to the New Orleans economy.   Related: LGBT battle far from over as 'religious freedom' bills multiply across the US    “In Louisiana, the state should not be able to take adverse action against a person for their belief in traditional marriage,” Jindal said in a statement. On Tuesday, the Louisiana house effectively killed HB 707, which would prevent the state from penalizing companies that take actions in accordance with their beliefs about same-sex marriage. Hours later, Jindal announced that he would force through the executive action, which grants similar protections to people with deeply held religious beliefs, as well as the organizations and companies they own. But critics call such protections state-sanctioned discrimination, with huge corporations – including Dow Chemical, Marriott and IBM, which is expanding its operations in the state – using the force of their local economic footprint to testify against the measure. “A bill that legally protects discrimination based on same-sex marriage status will create a hostile environment for our current and prospective employees, and is antithetical to our company’s values,” said IBM’s senior state executive, Jason Driesse, in a statement. Jindal responded by saying the bill “will absolutely not ‘protect discrimination’”. But he failed to ease the concerns of other major businesses, such as Dow Chemical, which employs more than 6,000 people in the state.  “We call upon our legislative leaders to focus on making our state more competitive and economically sound instead of taking actions that divide us as citizens,” Earl Shipp, vice-president of Dow Gulf Coast operations, said in a statement.  The New Orleans Convention and Visitors Bureau also opposed HB 707, citing concerns for the city’s tourism industry, which powers the Louisiana economy. “The adoption of certain types of overreaching, problematic and divisive legislation in Louisiana has the possibility of threatening our state’s third largest industry and creating economic losses pushing past a billion dollars a year and costing us tens of thousands of jobs,” said NOCVB president Stephen Perry.   rfra map   Jindal said that his order will remain in place for months – beyond the end of his administration – unless it is rescinded by the next governor. “This is a deeply political action guised in a light legal film,” said Adam Talbot, a spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), which has long opposed such measures. Louisiana is one of 13 states that still bans same-sex marriage, but state lawmakers across the US have been pushing so-called “religious freedom” legislation in anticipation of a US supreme court ruling next month on whether states are allowed to have such bans.  Talbot said HRC is optimistic that business pressure will continue to help stop such legislation from becoming law in other states.  The sponsor of Louisiana’s bill, Republican representative Mike Johnson, said he supports Jindal’s executive order, but would push for the religious freedom legislation to be heard in the next legislative session.  “As was just mentioned a few weeks ago in oral arguments at the US supreme court, it is incumbent upon every state to address this important issue as soon as possible,” Johnson said. “This is a good resolution for our state for now and we intend to bring this legislation again at the earliest opportunity.”",2015-05-20T19:58:46Z,Jindal enacts 'religious freedom' order despite firms' discrimination concerns,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""e72b356ae74618463420df701e4ffb18eb72ed8f""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432150988328/663565d7-ad8a-4ef4-b5dd-3a0458de454e-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Governor of Louisiana Bobby Jindal speaks in South Carolina."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Louisiana Bobby Jindal launched a presidential exploratory committee this week.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Chris Keane/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>",8,Governor and 2016 hopeful’s executive action bypasses state lawmakers who shelved an RFRA-like bill amid push for LGBT rights,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432150988593/663565d7-ad8a-4ef4-b5dd-3a0458de454e-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/20/bobby-jindal-rfra-lgbt-religious-freedom-executive-action,7
"Presidential hopefuls are used to having animated conversations about policy at the Iowa State Fair. But their interlocutors are not always Oscar-nominated actors. On Friday, Texas senator Ted Cruz engaged in a heated debate about LGBT rights and religious liberty with Juno and Inception star Ellen Page while flipping pork burgers at the Iowa State Fair. Page, who came out as gay in a 2014 speech, initially asked Cruz about his opposition to ENDA, federal legislation which would ban discrimination based on sexual orientation. The Texas Republican responded to Page’s initial question by arguing “what we’re seeing right now is actually Bible-believing Christians being persecuted”. Cruz is hosting a “rally for religious liberty” in Des Moines on Friday night, and mentioned the Odegaards, a couple due to appear at his event. The Texas Republican said that the Iowa couple, who have a wedding chapel on their property, were approached by a gay couple who wanted to hold their wedding there. The Odegaards refused, citing their religious faith, and ended up facing litigation as result, which they settled out of court for $5,000.  The Texas senator felt that the Odegaards should have been free to refuse to host the gay couple’s wedding and said he also believed that a gay florist would have the right to refuse to provide flowers to an evangelical wedding. Cruz went on to claim that there is “liberal intolerance” against “anyone that dares follow the biblical teaching of marriage”. Page disagreed and argued that “there needs to be more tolerance for LGBT people. It used to be illegal and they were thrown in jail and they have come a really long way.”  Cruz then argued that gay people faced the most discrimination from Isis and Iran and tried to attack Obama for reaching a nuclear deal with the Iranian regime. Page then pointed out that gay people faced violence and discrimination from “Christians in Russia, Christians in Uganda, Christians in Jamaica”. The Texas senator then said “murder is murder and it is wrong” but argued “there is a difference between a community like Jamaica which has different standards; it may not have gay pride parades but they aren’t murdering people.”  Page then responded accurately that “a lot of gay people are getting killed in Jamaica”. A 2014 report from the global NGO Human Rights Watch said there was “unchecked homophobic violence” in Jamaica. Shortly afterwards, Cruz abruptly ended his exchange with Page. The Texas Republican told reporters afterwards: “I think the conversation is about persecution of religious liberty and she didn’t want to have that conversation.”  Page, who – like Cruz – was born in Canada, has long been an active critic of the Texas senator.",2015-08-21T19:37:29Z,Ellen Page challenges Ted Cruz on LGBT rights at Iowa State Fair,"<figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/ellen-page-grills-ted-cruz-iowa-state-fair-33231356""                                                                        > <iframe width=""412"" height=""241"" src=""https://abcnews.go.com/video/twittercard?id=33231356"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The Texas senator engaged in a heated debate with the Juno and Inception star.</figcaption> </figure>",9,"On Friday, the Texas senator engaged in a heated debate about LGBT rights and religious liberty with the Juno and Inception star while flipping burgers at the fair",http://media.guim.co.uk/c4330bb28021a3ee571e4148a7f43ccf42e9afe7/0_0_620_372/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/21/ellen-page-ted-cruz-lgbt-rights-iowa-state-fair,0
"Uganda’s annual Pride festival begins in Kampala today, with organisers promising a week-long celebration for the country’s LGTB community. But rather than a triumphant parade through the city centre, in Uganda Pride will be marked at secret locations away from the public eye.  “It’s not a protest but a celebration,” says organiser Richard Lusimbo of the fourth annual Uganda Pride, which includes film screenings, a cocktail party, a (discreet) parade and a Mr and Ms Pride contest.  Because of security fears in a country where homosexuality remans illegal and homophobia is widespread, the events are by invitation only. Locations have been kept secret, with details circulated on private online networks.     Uganda Pride spokesperson Richard Lusimbo. Photograph: Richard Lusimbo    Lusimbo admits that Uganda has “a long way to come” before all sexualities are accepted, and says that as a public face of the event he does have concerns about his safety. “Sometimes I check behind my shoulders, but I can’t run for the rest of my life. I need to live it like a normal Ugandan,” he says. Last year’s Pride coincided with the overturning of a draconian anti-gay law, which called for homosexuals to be jailed for life. But LGBT people still face lengthy sentences if convicted under colonial-era laws.  The threat of harsher measures has not disappeared. In January a group of MPs were said to be working on new legislation to curb gay rights, including proposals to punish the “promotion” of homosexuality. There are also fears that parliamentarians could bring the earlier bill that as quashed on a legal technicality.  Lusimbo says that while anecdotal reports of harassment at the hands of police have dropped, in the past few months there’s been an upswing in gay Ugandans being ostracised by their families or their communities.  “The law is only part of it,” he says. “It doesn’t mean anything if you don’t have the people on your side. The biggest challenge is to get that neighbour, that shop keeper, that person working in the salon to support you.”  Despite being one of the most visible spokespeople for the Ugandan LGBT rights movement, Lusimbo is quick to reject any idea that he is personally brave: “there are thousands of people who are brave. I am privileged to be in a position to support them,” he says.     #gay #pride #uganda last weekend. great fun, brave people #UGPridepostAHA @GuardianAfrica pic.twitter.com/8GO9SlyH7T&mdash; iain statham (@gettingbye) August 14, 2014     Gay pride in exile    I broke down each time I denied my sexual orientation.​ I felt [I was] betraying myself  John Abdallah Wambere     One member of the community who won’t be there is John Abdallah Wambere, who was granted asylum in the US in November 2014. He describes Uganda as “hell and doom” for anyone who is lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender – a world of curtailed freedom, seclusion, isolation and paranoia. “You can’t tell who is watching or invading your space, disguising themselves as one of you,” he says from his new home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Wambere says people still face “rejection and discrimination” on the basis of their sexuality. People are being evicted and are unable to compete for jobs, he says, leading to an “exodus of LGBTI Ugandans… they want their freedom and they have to search for it elsewhere”. Wambere was outed by the media in 2005. During this time, he would find himself repeatedly lying to his family and friends. “I broke down each time I denied my sexual orientation. I felt [I was] betraying myself.” He was reunited with some of his colleagues to raise the Ugandan flag at gay Pride in New York city in June this year, including Frank Mugisha, Lusimbo and Jacqueline Kasha, founder of Bombastic, Uganda’s first LGBT paper and Pepe Julian Onziema, named Hero of the Year by Stonewall in 2014. “ I felt low because I should be carrying it high, celebrating my pride in my own country.” Maybe in 15 years or so, the situation will be different, he adds.   Related: 'Homophobia is not rooted in Uganda but influenced by extreme western churches' – Frank Mugisha Q&amp;A    Outed by the media Wambere was not the only one to have been outed by the media. It happened to Lusimbo twice: first in 2013, after which he had to go in to hiding for a month, and then again in 2014, when a tabloid splashed his face on the front cover under the headline Top Ugandan Gays Speak Out.  “It was such a hard moment, a full blow out. [It] created great panic and fear,” he says. His relationship with his family has been tricky ever since, but he’s hopeful he’ll win them back round one day. They all have invites to Pride. Mugisha, chair of Sexual Minorities Uganda, suffered a similar fate, being outed as one of Red Pepper’s “top 200 homosexuals” list. A few years earlier his friend and colleague David Kato had been outed by the now-defunct national weekly Rolling Stone. Weeks later he was found bludgeoned to death in his home. Today, Mugisha, who has suffered threats of violence himself, says the most negative development over the past year has been persecution at the hands of the media: people are scared of being exposed, he says.  Hidden voices Kapya Kaoma, a senior researcher at Political Research Associates, a think tank monitoring anti-LGBT sentiment in Africa, says he is “conflicted” about Ugandan pride. “It increases visibility, but it also perpetuates a falsehood that African sexual minorities are copies of their western counterparts. “The LGBTQ community in Uganda is bigger than visible activists. The most vulnerable are those who have no profile and live in poor places of Uganda. Their stories and voices are not heard.” On the other hand, Uganda is one of the few places in Africa where such an event can be held, he adds. Same sex relationships are illegal in 36 of the continent’s 55 countries, and most of these have never held Pride events.

"When I was 18 years old and came out to my mum, her first reaction was that I should be worried about my future. She believed being gay was a burden I would have to carry all my life. She told me to re-consider my “choice” and think about the consequences it could have on both my professional and social life. She said: “Who is going to employ you knowing you are gay? You will have to hide it. Society is not ready for that.” The OutNow 2020 report on homophobia (pdf) shows my mother’s worries were not unfounded. The study found that 16% of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in the UK have experienced harassment at work because of their sexuality. My brother, Pierre, who came out three years after myself, had a hard time in 2013 working for an IT company in Madrid because he was gay and had to handle homophobic comments from his bosses. I also had my own encounter while working for a French government department in China, with my boss telling me that I would be the perfect candidate to choose flowers for a diplomatic event. In 2013, our mum passed away. Pierre left his job in Spain and we decided it was time for us to fight for what we believed in: tolerance. We therefore created myGwork, a social recruitment hub similar to LinkedIn where people can be open about their sexuality and can help each other to find employment at companies with strong diversity and inclusion policies. Towards a diverse and inclusive work environment People in the closet spend so much time and energy lying to their bosses and colleagues about their sexuality that they become less productive. I could give many examples of acquaintances that go out in gay places during the weekend but are extremely stressed just to think of the idea of coming out at work. In this paper  diversity consultant Bob Powers explains the issues LGBT people face at work: “People fail to address LGBT issues in workplaces mainly because of the managers’ lack of knowledge and resources. This failure has repercussions on the LGBT employees’ performance. “First, as they do not feel involved in the organisation, their performances are not optimal. And second, employers encourage LGBT employees to hide their sexual orientation. Thus, the employees’ performances suffer from their efforts and time spent in avoiding sexual disclosure, they lose focus.” The OutNow report adds that 45% of LGBT people in the UK and 47% in America think they are being treated differently in the workplace because of their sexuality. The recent wave of diversity and inclusion policies in companies are the best ground to change mentalities and give hope to people who are struggling at work because of their sexuality. However, it is a hard task for HR directors to identify LGBT employees because it is not something visible, unlike when HR directors celebrate gender, age or race through positive discrimination. Dr Manuel J Tejeda, professor of management and psychology of the Barry Institute for Community and Economic Development, claims the most difficult thing for LGBT professionals is to disclose their sexuality to their bosses. Since starting myGwork, we have received emails to thank us for what we are doing. We also get letters from less fortunate LGBT professionals who live in countries where they do not have the chance to be themselves. We now have members from across five continents. We have seen a desire to improve equality in the workplace around the world. Our world is full of smart and capable LGBT people who are just a step away from living a successful and fulfilling life. To do that they first need acceptance from society and we believe this starts from the professional sector. I wish one day parents will not have to worry about their children’s future because of their sexuality. I also wish that one day every single LGBT individual will experience the same treatment as heterosexuals do.  Looking for a job?

"Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people who are 'out' at work waste little energy hiding aspects of their personalities, meaning they feel more confident and progress within the business. However, many remain in the closet.Most of Europe and the US is relatively accepting of the LGBT community; the issues that gay and trans people face here are minor in comparison to countries where displays of homosexuality can lead to prison, torture and death.Still, 34% of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in the UK choose not to disclose their sexuality at work. They hide their private lives from colleagues and clients for fear of homophobia, exclusion or in case they are overlooked for valuable promotions.Be it on the factory floor or in a board meeting; evading questions about family life can be like dodging bullets if you think that revealing your sexuality will make work relations difficult. LGBT people like myself are very aware of the fact that we live in a heteronormative society.Transgender people, whose sexuality often has nothing to do with the discrimination they encounter, face further stigma still due to a widespread lack of understanding of the issue. Many choose to leave their workplace in order to undergo their transition.What can businesses do to create a culture of inclusion?It's no wonder, perhaps, that companies have been skirting around the LGBT question, treating it as the elephant in the room. There are few 'out' role models to demonstrate that members of the LGBT community even exist in business.Lord John Browne (whose recently published book The Glass Closet is essential reading for anyone taking diversity in the workplace seriously) is one of few openly gay business figures and we need more people to be as courageous as him.As well as a wider representation of gay and trans people in business, we also need straight allies to be vocal about their backing and we need businesses to make a stand.A company that can pledge its support to employees irrespective of their skin colour, gender or sexuality stands to benefit hugely; firstly by creating a sense of empowerment among employees and secondly by setting an industry standard that can pave the way for change across society.Increasingly, businesses are doing that.Thousands of Apple employees marched together in San Francisco's pride parade in July while Burger King trended on Twitter as it launched a Pride burger.These widely reported events spread the message that LGBT people should be celebrated and gave these companies great media coverage. However, support isn't just needed during Pride; businesses can benefit from pledging their alliance all year round.Using a combination of subtle signals and bold statements, companies can create an inclusive atmosphere that permeates throughout the entire organisation – and ultimately throughout society. The solutions can, as we have seen, be simple and yet have extremely positive outcomes; all that is required is an open mind and responsible leadership.Office ""banter"" can establish a culture of subordination and complaints should be taken seriously. A clear message from management about the importance of diversity can help eliminate any doubts as to who or what can be made light of while recruitment processes, training and communications can help make the company's stance clear.Education is key, as is the desire to embrace people for who they are, not who they love. Once that is covered, the rest will follow.There are the bolder statements that can help create a welcoming workplace for all. Gender-neutral toilets, those without a sex assigned to the door, are a clear sign that gender is a non-issue.LGBT groups such as Barclays Spectrum can do a fantastic job of supporting employees within a bigger cooperation. Smaller companies can invite employees to attend local LGBT networking events, sponsor a Pride party or welcome speakers to share their experiences.The opportunities are endless for any business that wants to promote diversity but change will not come over night.Taking steps towards an inclusive workplace and measuring the results will send the message that a business wants progress, that it wishes to have the LGBT community on-board and that it is serious about diversity. That will be a great leap in the right direction for anyone, regardless of their sexuality, and it might just be the sign that makes someone feel comfortable about coming out.Get involvedWe'd like to know your thoughts on this topic.

"The American religious right is more determined than ever to discriminate - and that may be a good thing. It means that the privileged can no longer overlook the impact of prejudice. They no longer have the luxury of overlooking it or dismissing it as something that’s none of their concern. Wheaton College, an evangelical Christian college in Illinois, announced last week that it was dropping health insurance for all its students rather than comply with Obamacare’s contraception mandate. Under the compromise offered by the Obama administration, religious employers that object to birth control can notify their insurer, who then provides it to covered individuals without involving the employer, but Wheaton argued that even having to state their objection was an intolerable violation of their religious conscience - a claim that would undoubtedly lead to chaos if it were widely accepted. Along the same lines, since the US supreme court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in Obergefell v Hodges, some county clerks and probate judges in conservative states like Kentucky and Alabama have have announced that they’ll no longer issue marriage licenses to anyone, gay or straight, rather than face a discrimination lawsuit they’d be certain to lose for turning away a same-sex couple. Even before landmark rulings like Obergefell, religious groups were engaging in this massive-resistance strategy. Catholic charities have shut down in both the US and the UK, ending services like adoption assistance and foster care, so as not to have to give benefits to same-sex partners of employees or consider same-sex couples as prospective parents. Catholic schools are also notorious for firing popular gay teachers and principals in the face of protests by students - and some are responding by making their morality clauses even more draconian. These tactics echo the civil rights era, when some municipalities shut down their public schools entirely, as well as other public accommodations like pools, rather than desegregate them. In the same way, today’s religious conservatives are so determined to continue discriminating against women and LGBT people that they’re willing to deprive everyone of rights and privileges rather than grant equal treatment to people who, in their eyes, don’t deserve it. In a strange way, this is a sign of progress. These decisions may well mean that more people are being materially deprived than would otherwise be the case. But it also means that the costs of that discrimination are being spread across all of society, borne by everyone equally, rather than being concentrated on politically less-powerful demographics. For a politics that’s based on justice and empathy, that’s good news. It’s human nature to not care about injustices that don’t directly affect you. When it’s only same-sex couples, for example, who face rejection at the county clerk’s office, it’s easy for straight people to ignore their plight. When it’s only women who are denied access to standard and necessary reproductive healthcare, it’s easy for men to dismiss it as not their problem. But when members of the majority feel the sting of unfair deprivation for themselves, they’ll gain a more intimate perspective on how prejudice hurts – and, we can hope, they’ll be more willing to support democratic means to abolish it and to create a fairer society for everyone. Ideally, of course, people would be willing to do the right thing just from hearing about the mistreatment of others, even without experiencing it personally, but this comes in a close second. Too often, religion is thought of as a purely benevolent and positive force, despite the role it has played in justifying harmful prejudice and the ongoing denial of equal rights. But these hardball massive-resistance tactics, this stubborn desire to enforce their will despite the collateral costs, brings people face to face with the anti-human side of religious morality in a way that’s a lot harder to overlook. Atheists have long made this criticism, but ironically, it’s the religious conservatives themselves who are lending it greater weight and force.",2015-08-04T14:45:06Z,There’s a silver lining in the religious right’s onslaught of discrimination,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""e1b5cc307e13d8dd51240bd1a5c2a9a5066624bc""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/3/1438636130063/17b20ce1-74c2-4b8d-b43f-f8d5a59e6147-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""lgbt"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Some would rather deny everyone access to healthcare or marriage than give into LGBT people and women.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",13,"When religious groups go so far out of the way to shun LGBT people and women that we all feel the pain, it makes us all care more about injustice <br>",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/3/1438636130408/17b20ce1-74c2-4b8d-b43f-f8d5a59e6147-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/04/theres-a-silver-lining-in-the-religious-rights-onslaught-of-discrimination,2
"London’s Jewish, Muslim and LGBT communities have joined forces to oppose plans by Boris Johnston for a hate-crime hotline, claiming it would dissuade victims from reporting antisemitic, Islamophobic and homophobic attacks at a time of rising attacks.  Not yet officially announced, internal emails from the mayor’s office for policing and crime, seen by the Guardian, reveal that Johnson is intending to introduce a one-number hotline for reporting hate crime throughout the capital.  However, the Community Service Trust, a Jewish security charity that runs an incident hotline; Tell Mama (Measuring Anti-Muslim Attacks), which monitors Islamophobic incidents in Britain; and the charity Galop, which records hate crime towards lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, say that Johnson’s plans will dilute community trust in the existing hotlines and discourage reporting. “Reporting relies on trust between organisations and their communities, and a one-number, blanket approach ignores this fundamental principle,” said Nik Noone, chief executive of Galop. The development comes as statistics show that the number of antisemitic incidents in the UK recently reached the highest level ever recorded, with CST reports of violence, property damage, abuse and threats against Britain’s 291,000 Jews more than doubling last year. Last year some of the UK’s biggest police forces recorded a rise in the number of violent homophobic crimes.  Similarly, Muslims in Britain are consistently the target of hate crimes in retribution for global terrorist attacks, with noticeable spikes observed in the immediate aftermath of high-profile terrorist attacks in Paris, Sydney, and Copenhagen in the past year.  New figures reveal that pattern was repeated during the aftermath of the shootings in Tunisia that killed 38 including 30 British nationals last month. During the week before the attack, Tell Mama recorded 11 incidents of offline and online Islamophobia, rising to 23 in the week following the terror attack in Sousse.  Richard Benson, former chief executive of the CST for 12 years until 2013, said: “It is quite clear that communities feel more comfortable when they are victims of a hate crime to report the issue to somebody within that community who understands them.  “That’s why the CST and Tell Mama have both been successful in providing a level of support to their communities, but to have a one-stop shop that covers every single community will be confusing and, secondly, will dilute the existing successful work currently carried out by those groups.” A similar proposal by the Metropolitan police, said Benson, to introduce a hate crime monitoring hotline was defeated around five years ago after resistance by experts and anti-discrimination groups.   The CST declined to comment, pointing out that Benson was speaking in his capacity as former director of the charity. Noone said the mayor’s plans risked undermining the existing schemes that meant London was a world leader in its approach to hate crime.  “If London wants to retain its place as a world-leading city in tackling hate crime they need to retain and invest in the community-built solution, not impose a new generalist service that will push away direct access to the specialist services which are at the heart of why London is currently the world leader.” She added: “These community-led approaches have made the UK the world leader for hate crime reporting. A quarter of all anti-LGBT hate crime reports in UK are made in London and the city has more hate crime reports each year than the whole of the US.”  Fiyaz Mughal, who founded interfaith group Faith Matters, which runs Tell Mama, said: “There is a real problem with this, since singular reporting points do not work well and where implemented, anti-Muslim hate figures are extremely low. Furthermore, another number will confuse members of the public and, in relation to anti-Muslim hate, it is already difficult to report and this will add another layer of confusion. It will also segment data-collection.” According to the emails from Johnson’s office, the launch of the hotline will be announced during Hate Crime Awareness Week in October. A spokesperson for the mayor’s office for policing and crime said: “While there has been an increase in the reporting of hate crime, we know that these offences are still significantly under-reported and that is why the mayor is committed to making it easier for victims to come forward”.  This article was amended on 5 August 2015 to clarify that the Community Service Trust had declined to comment.

"The Gay Men’s Chorus of Washington DC  are swapping their tuxedos for linen shirts and khakis for a tour in Cuba, where they hope to break down language, political and cultural barriers with music – and promote LGBT rights. Twenty members of the 300-person choir are traveling to Havana on Saturday for a tour that will take them to a city library, youth centers and a retirement home in the countryside. “What I’m excited about is going down and getting past the politics to the people: person-to-person, American to Cuban, having a conversation about music, about LGBT issues,” said the chorus’ artistic director Thea Kano. Cuba, like the US, has become more friendly to LGBT citizens in the past decade, though discrimination is still a pressing issue. The government offers gender reassignment surgery and treatments for transgender people, but has not made same-sex marriage legal.  Despite this, Mariela Castro, the daughter of Cuban president Raúl Castro, led a blessing ceremony for same-sex couples in May during the country’s eighth annual March Against Homophobia and Transphobia.     Mariela Castro, daughter of Cuba’s President Raúl Castro, in Havana in 2008. Photograph: Javier Galeano/AP    The trip comes as relations between Cuba and the US continue to thaw. In December, US president Barack Obama announced plans to normalize relations . Kano said the chorus members see themselves as American ambassadors who can contribute to this process by supporting LGBT equality on the ground and bringing people together with music. If the chorus does end up interacting with people who oppose LGBT rights, they hope the same tactics that win over conservative US audiences will work there. “Music has been a vehicle to get a message through when words fail,” Kano said. The nonprofit Youth For Understanding USA (YFU) approached the chorus about touring in Cuba as part of its first adult-exchange program. The trip was further supported by Mariela Castro, who heads the National Center for Sex Education, and invited the Washington chorus to perform with Cuba’s newly formed gay chorus, Mano a Mano. On the first day of the trip, the chorus will meet with Mano a Mano, a five-man ensemble. The two groups have been corresponding ahead of the trip, with Mano a Mano recording its Spanish rendition the Washington DC chorus’ theme Make Them Hear You. As the groups are planning to perform in both languages together, Mano a Mano also sent a copy of a performance of the theme in English, something that Kano said is indicative of how they hope music can cut through the divisions between US and Cuba relations. Kano said that along with texting each other about how to pack for the tropical heat, the group has been discussing what they want to accomplish from the trip and their hopes and fears about a country that has been closed to nearly all US citizens since the embargo became official in 1962. “I want to make sure that I don’t miss an opportunity to speak my truth, how I feel about equality,” said Kano, who admitted that she doesn’t know a lot about what life is like for an LGBT Cuban. “I want to be sure I don’t miss the opportunity to listen, to hear from a Cuban friend that I meet, to talk about his or her experience.” Kano said that while she has been trying to research Cuba in between rehearsals and more practical trip considerations, the group knows very little about what life is like for an LGBT Cuban.",2015-07-10T11:00:10Z,Gay Men's Chorus of Washington to bring LGBT message to Cuba,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""d824a1bfb353ddfa9198c8de1f41a63eec593e7d""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/d824a1bfb353ddfa9198c8de1f41a63eec593e7d/0_79_2048_1229/1000.jpg"" alt=""Gay Men's Chorus of Washington DC"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The Gay Men’s Chorus of Washington DC’s May concert entitled Born This Way.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: James Dillon O'Rourke and Michael Key/Gay Men's Chorus of Washington DC</span> </figcaption> </figure>",15,Chorus’s artistic director says members see themselves as ambassadors who can contribute to diplomatic process by bringing people together with music,http://media.guim.co.uk/d824a1bfb353ddfa9198c8de1f41a63eec593e7d/0_79_2048_1229/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/10/gay-mens-chorus-washington-cuba-lgbt,4

" As a transgender man, Allan says he had nowhere to go when his relationship became violent and a partner would beat him up and force him to have sex with men for money. “There were times when the violence got too much for me and I thought I was living in a bad dream. I lost my job, car, home and had no money,” said 49-year-old Allan. At the time, Allan was female , the sex he was assigned at birth, but he says he has always identified as a man.    Related: LGBT activists call for new focus on violence against transgender community    Allan moved to San Francisco to get away from what he says was an abusive relationship and take refuge at the San Francisco Asian women’s shelter, one of the first and few shelters in the US that offers a specific program and a trained social worker for gay and transgender victims of domestic violence, which is often called intimate partner violence. “There has been a steady increase of intimate partner violence in the LGBT community and the rates are higher than of hate violence towards LGBT, but we still don’t have enough support services to help people get out of violent relationships,” said Chai Jindasurat, co-director of Community Organizing and Public Advocacy at the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP), a New York City-based national organization working to reduce violence and its impact on LGBT individuals in the US.  By April 2015 NCAVP had recorded 14 LGBT homicides for the year. Eight of the incidents were reportedly intimate partner-, family- or sexual violence-related and six were hate or police violence-related.  In 2013, NCAVP’s 18 local partner organizations received 2,697 reports of intimate partner violence (IPV), a slight increase from the 2,679 reports received in 2012. The NCAVP documented 21 intimate partner homicides in 2013, which is equal to the 21 homicides in 2012 but more than three times the six IPV-related homicides in 2010.    Also in 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the national intimate partner and sexual violence survey, which detailed data about sexual assaults that occurred in 2010 and broke it down by sexual orientation. It was the first national survey estimating how prevalent intimate partner violence, sexual violence and stalking are among people who are lesbian, gay or bisexual in the US.  It found four in 10 lesbian women, six in 10 bisexual women, and one in three heterosexual womenreported experiencing rape, physical violence or stalking within the context of an intimate partner relationship at least once during their lifetime. The CDC data also shows that four out of 10 gay men, half of bisexual men), and one in five heterosexual men in the US have experienced sexual violence other than rape at some point in their lives.  The CDC survey didn’t address violence in transgender relationships. Jindasurat says people in such relationships face increasing hate violence and intimate partner violence.  “There aren’t any specific domestic violence shelters or housing support for LGBT individuals in most of the country, but especially here in San Francisco where the community is very big,” said Carolina Morales, co-director of Community United Against Violence (CUAV), a counselling and support center that has been working with survivors of domestic violence in the LGBT community in San Francisco since 1979. Morales says that she routinely receives complaints from LGBT individuals who have been turned away at the domestic violence shelters in San Francisco. “When they are allowed into some traditional domestic violence shelters, oftentimes the shelter staff don’t have the training to work with LGBT individuals or the other housemates call them names and look down on them,” said Morales, who has been with CUAV since 2009.  Hediana Utarti runs the queer Asian women and transgender support program at the San Francisco Asian women’s shelter. She worked with Allan during his recovery and supported him during his transition. She says that the shelter receives more than 2,000 calls a year on its domestic violence call line and about 40 a year from LGBT individuals.  “I think there are more LGBT victims of domestic violence, but they need specific services just for them because when they call a help line they want to speak to someone who doesn’t assume that their abuser is the opposite sex and understands their situation,” said Utarti. She says that Allan was fearless in that he immediately said in his group therapy sessions that his abuser was a woman, but that most lesbian, bisexual or transgender women hide that their abuser is a woman because they fear the homophobic attitudes and responses of the other women in the shelters. The shelter has five rooms and can house 15 women at one time. Utarti admits that this isn’t enough to meet the demand of heterosexual survivors of domestic violence, let alone the LGBT individuals that they get calls from. She and Morales say that for many LGBT survivors of domestic violence, the most helpful resource is transitional housing services, especially in San Francisco’s expensive housing rental market. The services could include support to find and pay for an individual apartment or studio for three months to a year while the individual goes through counselling, especially in the case of highly vulnerable individuals.  “Many LGBT survivors of domestic violence are already facing high levels of discrimination, but transgender women of color are extremely vulnerable to violence and have the least access to legal, health and financial resources,” said Morales. “They are also less likely to seek help from their parents or other family members than other survivors of domestic violence.” Allan says that during the time he was in the violent relationship with his partner, he was an undocumented Mexican immigrant and barely spoke English. “A few times I called the police on my partner but … I had no way of telling them my side of the story.” After arriving at the San Francisco Asian women’s shelter, Allan began learning English and with the help of Utarti obtained a US visa specifically to protect victims of sexual trafficking.  Other LGBT survivors of domestic violence say that there aren’t enough support groups for them nor enough accessible therapists who understand the power dynamics and the nuances of violence in gay or transgender relationships. “I am physically bigger and stronger than my partner, but she is the abusive one,” said a 36-year-old lesbian woman who lives in San Francisco and didn’t want to give her full name for privacy reasons. “The power dynamics are very different in gay relationships and you can’t apply the traditional domestic violence assumptions or treatments.”",2015-07-04T11:15:08Z,Transgender victims have few places to turn as LGBT domestic violence climbs,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""fbe500509669e488042bbae8e66cd5aa89001341""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435703593112/e863c162-7d02-4bda-b508-265a6e6ed44e-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""allan transgender violence"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Allan: ‘There were times when the violence got too much for me and I thought I was living in a bad dream.’</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Halima Kazem</span> </figcaption> </figure>",17,"With surveys pointing to a growing problem, transgender and other LGBT Americans struggle to find understanding through traditional support services",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435703593429/5bbc908a-c336-41bd-b643-fec5c958bd46-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/04/transgender-lgbt-domestic-violence,8
"Advocates for transgender rights are hoping that last week’s historic US supreme court ruling on gay marriage will pave the way to renewed public focus on what they see as a national crisis of violence, sexual assault and custodial abuse against trans individuals. So far this year alone, at least nine trans women have been murdered, putting 2015 on track to be one of the most violent periods for transgender individuals in recent times. In the most recent incident, the body of a 17-year-old trans woman called Mercedes Williamson was found last month hidden under the brush in a desolate area of southern Mississippi, reportedly displaying stab wounds. The grim discovery was made just three weeks before last Friday’s ruling that flung open the doors across all 50 states to same-sex marriage. Leaders of the transgender community see the murder as a reminder amid the nationwide rejoicing that despite the extraordinary leap forward made last week, there are many people still in great danger in today’s United States.    Related: Transgender victims have few places to turn as LGBT domestic violence climbs    Advocacy groups hope that the same public focus and enthusiasm for change that produced such an irresistible surge in support for gay marriage will now coalesce behind their decades-old struggle for trans equality. They are loth to describe the fight as a new frontline – fearing that would belittle the hard work that has been waged over many years largely out of the limelight. But they think the time has now come for a push to reverse extreme discrimination that continues to put lives at risk. “Clearly gay marriage has been a cause of great celebration,” said Kris Hayashi, executive director of the Transgender Law Center. “But it’s critical to remember that many members of our community cannot celebrate when they are struggling to survive on a daily basis.” Top of the list of priorities articulated by transgender groups is the ongoing epidemic of violence faced particularly by black trans women. Shannon Minter, legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said that hate violence was running at levels that rendered it a national crisis. “The issue is so urgent as the harm is so severe. We have to deal with it better than we have,” he said.     Laverne Cox, star of Orange is the New Black, has raised the profile of trans women but nearly half of all black trans women in the US will go to prison. Photograph: Noah Berger/AP    In its report into hate violence in 2014, the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs warned of an ongoing “crisis of deadly violence against transgender women of color”. It was the fourth year in a row that the monitoring group had highlighted disproportionate levels of severe violence. Associated with the physical threats against trans women is their treatment by police, as well as detention in prisons, jails and immigration facilities. A recent study by the Fenway Institute found that one in five trans women has experienced life behind bars, a proportion that shockingly rises to almost half of all black trans women. Chase Strangio, a staff attorney with the ACLU, said the criminalization of trans women of color was a central priority for modern civil rights. “We have to fight the atrocious conditions that people experience in custody, including high incidence of sexual assault, use of solitary confinement and lack of access to medical treatment for gender transition.” Strangio added that there was a paradox in the way that the criminal justice system related to trans people. As public discussion around gender identity grows – with celebrities such as Caitlyn Jenner and Laverne Cox leading the way – the tendency to criminalize has also grown. “As the visibility of trans women has increased, so have attempts to detain them.” Minter said: “It’s not an overstatement to say people are living under conditions of torture. Forced to shower with men, subjected to strip searches by male guards. We hear stories all the time – all the time – about guards using their power to harass, abuse and torture prisoners.” Lawyers are pressing on several fronts to help trans prisoners gain access to appropriate medical treatment. In most prisons and jails across the country, it remains extremely difficult to get any treatment at all for gender dysphoria – varying from the most basic access to lipstick and eyeliner, to facial hair removal and prescriptions of hormones. When it comes to gender reassignment surgery, most states have imposed blanket bans despite the constitutional duty of corrections departments to medically care for their charges. In one of the most closely watched cases, Michelle Norsworthy, a trans woman and prisoner in Mule Creek state prison in California, has sued to be allowed surgery. Her case is likely to be heard by the ninth circuit appeals court next month. In recent months activists have also become alarmed by conditions inside immigration detention facilities. An investigation by the Fusion website estimated that while about one in 500 immigration detainees are transgender, they make up about one in five victims of sexual assault in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities. In December, a coalition of more than 100 LGBT groups wrote to the White House calling for all transgender immigrant detainees to be released immediately. “It’s become very clear that ICE cannot house trans immigrants safely,” Hayashi said. On Monday the Obama administration responded to the rising tide of criticism by producing new guidelines that could see transgender immigrants detained in facilities consistent with their identity – trans women in female detention centers, trans men in male. The move was welcomed by campaigners, but it is unlikely to silence their protests, which saw Obama heckled by a trans woman immigrant last week. Minter said that the Obama administration deserved credit for the new regulations. “But we still hold them – and us, the advocacy community as well – responsible for not doing enough. We cannot continue to accept this level of mistreatment.”",2015-07-04T11:00:10Z,LGBT activists call for new focus on violence against transgender community,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""30e5c355c5ccc00dc9044a0a8791cab5b8339081""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/30e5c355c5ccc00dc9044a0a8791cab5b8339081/0_0_3000_1801/1000.jpg"" alt=""A contigent for ‘Trans-Life’ takes part in the 2015 San Francisco Pride Parade."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A contingent for ‘Trans-Life’ takes part in the 2015 San Francisco Pride Parade.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: John Orvis/Demotix/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>",18,"While the supreme court victory on gay marriage sparked celebrations, the lives of transgender individuals – particularly black trans women – remain in danger",http://media.guim.co.uk/30e5c355c5ccc00dc9044a0a8791cab5b8339081/0_0_3000_1801/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/04/transgender-violence-lgbt-rights-activists,6
"In some ways, Simón Cazal’s experience of coming out was like that of any young gay man in a small rural town: there was no local scene or support group he could turn to; the books in his college library said that homosexuality was an illness. But Cazal had the particular misfortune to come to terms with his sexuality in Paraguay: a deeply conservative country which at that point was barely out of a 40-year military dictatorship which rounded up and tortured gay people. “When I got up the courage to tell my parents that I thought I was gay, their reaction was terrible. They said that I was disrespecting them and breaking their rules,” said Cazal. “They said that this country didn’t have space for people like me. They said that if I ‘chose’ to be gay, I couldn’t stay in the house. And they threw me out in the street.”   Related: Colombia: the next battleground in the global fight for marriage equality    Twenty years on, Cazal is set to make history. As the director of LGBT advocacy organization SomosGay, he is set to participate in a civil society roundtable with Pope Francis, who touches down in the small South American nation of barely seven million inhabitants on Friday as part of a whistle-stop regional tour.  Saturday’s encounter, albeit with several hundred other activists, will be the first time a sitting pope has publicly met with an LGBT campaigner. Sitting in SomosGay’s colourful offices in the capital of Asunción, Cazal is clearly riding a wave of optimism that things in Paraguay are finally beginning to change. He’s quick to erupt into laughter, even when describing how he was fired from his job after attending a gay rights march in 2003, and thrown out of his apartment last year for hanging a rainbow flag from the balcony. But his cheerfulness evaporates when he relates how, soon after unofficially founding SomosGay 10 years ago, he was attacked twice in three months – once by the police. “They knocked me unconscious and left me for dead … They broke me as a person, on every level. It was really hard to recover from so much violence,” he said. Paraguay’s LGBT community still experiences a huge amount of discrimination. Of the 6,000 people referred to SomosGay each year, 93% have been the victim of violence. Fifty-four transexual people have been killed in Paraguay since the fall of of dictator Alfredo Stroessner in 1989. Boys are beaten up by their family for acting “too feminine”, and the NGO regularly receives reports of girls being submitted to “corrective rape”, sometimes by members of their own family, when they come out as gay. Minimal levels of care for HIV sufferers lead to easily preventable deaths. For Cazal, the everyday discrimination is “directly related” to the outright homophobia displayed by Paraguay’s political class. President Horacio Cartes notoriously said prior to his election in 2013 that he would rather “shoot himself in the balls” than have a gay son. When police attacked an LGBT demonstration in 2014 and hospitalized activists a senior minister told local press that “homophobia doesn’t exist in Paraguay”. “They say these things because they know they can get away with it,” said Cazal. “It makes you feel like a stranger in your own country. It discourages you. But then it makes you angry. It makes you think we’re going to stay and fight … if not for ourselves, then for the next generation so they don’t have to go through the same things as us.” When he first received the invitation from the national bishop’s conference to attend Saturday’s meeting, he thought it was a joke. Cazal admitted that he and his colleagues were not sure if he should accept: other LGBT organizations have refused to attend due to the religious character of the meeting. “Some people said don’t even think about it, because it’s obviously a marketing move to present the pope as more open than he is and the church in a good light,” he said. “But in Paraguay, 92% of people are Catholic and love the pope. If we reject the invitation, we’re rejecting democracy.”  Attending the meeting, he said, does not signal their support for the church – Cazal is an atheist – but offers a chance to reach the “people in the street, not the Catholic hierarchy”, he said.  “They’ll see that the pope invited gay people, and gay people went. And, at best, people will begin to think in a different way.”  Since news of the meeting came out, Cazal has been flooded with messages of support. One wall of Cazal’s office is occupied by a mural of Batman, locked in a passionate embrace with a Robin-like figure. It’s an apt choice for a reluctant hero, who is still faintly bemused by the media coverage he has received. And once the media circus has died down, Cazal will continue his work championing Paraguay’s LGBT community. “Here, we’re going to carry on. But with a new weapon. We have a new banner that we didn’t have before: we have the banner of the pope. And we’re going to use it for as a long as we can, to talk with people who see our existence as against their faith. This is going to give us a lot of strength.”",2015-07-10T09:00:07Z,"Historic papal meeting can help change minds in Paraguay, says LGBT activist","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""5c942b9c2149b15878d4f765fbca1d2741f7ca31""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/5c942b9c2149b15878d4f765fbca1d2741f7ca31/0_46_4952_2973/1000.jpg"" alt=""simon cazal paraguay lgbt somosgay"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Simón Cazal hopes the meeting with Pope Francis when he lands in Paraguay on Friday offers a chance to reach the ‘people in the streets, not the Catholic hierarchy’.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Norberto Duarte/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",19,The SomosGay director set to be among the first LGBT campaigners to meet with Pope Francis in country where community is often persecuted by violence ,http://media.guim.co.uk/5c942b9c2149b15878d4f765fbca1d2741f7ca31/0_46_4952_2973/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/10/simon-cazal-pope-francis-paraguay-lgbt-somosgay,4
"The US supreme court’s ruling that same-sex marriage is a legal right across the country marks a milestone in the march for equality. But the ever-expanding rainbow map of America, bolstered by the Friday verdict, is in stark contrast to the state of LGBT rights in the rest of the world, where as many as 80 countries are still hostile toward gay people. Despite recent progress in the US, Latin America and even Ireland – one of the most conservative societies in Europe – the global campaign for the rights of sexual minorities has experienced a series of setbacks in other regions including Africa and the Middle East.  Fewer than 1 billion of the world’s population live in countries where same-sex marriage or civil unions are recognised, compared to almost 2.8 billion living in countries which criminalise gay people and impose severe punishments on homosexuality, such as imprisonment, lashings and even death sentences.    same sex marriage world map   In around 10 countries, homosexuality is punishable by death, including Saudi Arabia, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Sudan and Brunei.  Jessica Stern, the executive director of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC), welcomed the US supreme court’s ruling on Friday but said that the campainers’ work is far from over. “Today and for weeks and months to come, Americans will celebrate today’s historic ruing – a dream come true for tens of thousands of [people],” she said. “The US has joined 19 other countries in recognition of the freedom to marry for same-sex couples nationwide and yet, our work is far from over – not in the US and not around the world.”  She added: “Marriage equality is one slice of the pie, but homophobia and transphobia morph into different shapes in law and practice. Nearly 80 countries still criminalize same-sex intimacy and countless prohibit so-called ‘cross-dressing’.” Charles Radcliffe, the UN’s special adviser on LGBT rights and the head of global issues at the UN human rights office in New York, said that the global picture was not entirely bleak and stressed that there have been significant improvements worldwide.  “There have been some setbacks, notably in some parts of the former Soviet Union and a few African countries, but it’s important not to lose sight of the larger picture, which remains one of enormous progress affecting LGBT people in most of the world,” he said.  “Whether on marriage, new anti-discrimination laws or transgender inclusion, we continue to see big steps forward. Advances have not been confined to western countries, some of the most striking changes have occurred in Latin America, and positive measures have also been taken by some African and Asian countries. And almost everywhere – even in hostile places – you see greater visibility of LGBT communities and LGBT activism.” Recent improvements on gay rights, he said, include a new gender identity law in Argentina, a new civil union law in Chile, constitutional amendments in Malta, decriminalisation of gay relationships in Mozambique, pro-transgender assistance in India, and decriminalisation of homosexuality in Pacific countries such as Fiji and Palau.  But many countries in Africa and the Middle East are extremely hostile to gay people, who remain at risk of criminalisation or homophobic violence.   lgbt persecution world map   According to Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, the intensifying backlash in the world is partly due to the greater visibility of the LGBT community in societies that have begun to recognise their rights. “LGBT people are also convenient scapegoats for embattled leaders, who are trying to rally support from more conservative sectors of their society. Whether it’s Uganda, Nigeria or Russia, the decision to scapegoat the LGBT community is an outcome of serious challenges to the regime, for widespread corruption or abusive authoritarianism,” he said, according to HRW’s website.  “The status of the LGBT community is a good litmus test for the status of human rights in society more broadly, precisely because it is such a vulnerable minority – similar to the proverbial canary in the coal mine. Where the rights of LGBT people are undermined, you can be sure that the rights of other minorities and critical members of civil society will soon also be in jeopardy.” The Commonwealth remains a bastion of homophobia, with 41 out 53 member states still using British colonial-era legislation to criminalise homosexuals.   A major setback for gay rights campaigners was a 2013 ruling by India’s supreme court which re-criminalised gay sex in the country, said Felicity Daly, executive director of the Kaleidoscope Trust.  In Trinidad and Tobago gay people can be jailed for up to 25 years; in Malaysia the punishment for being gay is 20 years plus an additional sentence of lashing. Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Pakistan, Uganda, Bangladesh and Guyana all impose life imprisonment for homosexuality. Earlier this month in Morocco, two gay men were sentenced to four months each in jail after they were arrested for standing too close to one another as they posed for a photograph. Amid improvements, violence against gay people remain a big concern, said Joel Simkhai, the CEO of gay dating app Grindr. “Since 2008, activists have documented over 800 murders of transgender people,” he wrote in a column for the Huffington Post last month.  “Sometimes the perpetrators who act against us represent governments, themselves, as happened with police raids on a gay bar in Kenya last year. Other times, it is their lack of action to protect us that makes officials complicit, as when Russia ignored gun violence and gas attacks on gay clubs in Moscow. There are countless other acts of violence around the world that go unreported and ignored by local officials.” Speaking after Friday’s ruling, Stern said gay activists in the US should now turn their attention to fresh challenges. “First, we must address those who are most vulnerable within this country, including transgender people in immigration detention. Second, I hope that we will join the global movement to fight intolerance and affirm fundamental dignity. That work must truly become our own, if we hope to achieve a world free and equal for all. Today is not an end but a new beginning.”.",2015-06-26T17:06:04Z,Global LGBT community still gripped by homophobic state-sponsored violence,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""4a53a2880321d12e08f70e1e17edbb8bc168f609""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/4a53a2880321d12e08f70e1e17edbb8bc168f609/0_91_3597_2164/1000.jpg"" alt=""india gay rights lgbt flag"" width=""1000"" height=""602"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">An Indian gay-rights activist gestures behind a flag during a protest in Bangalore, against the supreme court ruling reinstating a ban on gay sex.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Manjunath Kiran/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",20,"As the US joins 19 other countries in recognising marriage as a legal right, billions of LGBT people across the world are still fighting for basic human rights",http://media.guim.co.uk/4a53a2880321d12e08f70e1e17edbb8bc168f609/0_91_3597_2164/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/26/lgbt-same-sex-marriage-homophobia-violence-world,5
"LGBT people in Britain’s rural towns and villages are being bullied relentlessly because of their sexuality, leaving some too scared to leave the house, according to an expert in hate crime. Stevie-Jade Hardy, a lecturer at the University of Leicester’s Centre for Hate Studies and the author of a report on hate crime, said harassment and verbal abuse was an everyday reality for many lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. She said LGBT people were being left “lonely and isolated with nowhere to turn”, but many did not report hate crimes because they feared that the police would not take them seriously or that they would be “outed” to their families. “There were quite a few who mentioned being targeted by young people in their area,” Hardy said. “People would graffiti their house or cause criminal damage, young people when they walked down the street would verbally abuse them, call them derogatory names, and often it would start to escalate. “If something was done about it, then they found that sometimes the instances got worse and those young people were targeting them more frequently. But it tended to be those more everyday experiences that are incredibly difficult to deal with – that drip-drip effect.” Hardy pointed to national figures that suggest eight in 10 LGBT people have been verbally abused or harassed and one in 10 has been physically assaulted. She said LGBT people felt they were more likely to be the victim of hate crime if they were “noticeably different”, potentially making those in villages particularly vulnerable. “Within rural locations those differences are maybe magnified, and so young people will often target someone who they see as being different in that context. People are actually scared to go out into their garden to enjoy the sun; some people had taken some practical steps like having CCTV put into their house. “It can be really damaging, particularly in the rural locations it tended to be older LGBT people as well. And so there isn’t often that community or that group you can go to to access support. That was a big issue, just feeling lonely and isolated and that there is nowhere to turn.” Hardy said 44 of the 50 people she had spoken to for her report – LGB&amp;T Crime Reporting: Identifying Barriers and Solutions – had been a victim of a hate crime.  She said about 35,000 cases of hate crime against LGBT people went unreported each year. In 2012-13, 4,267 incidents were recorded by police. The Crime Survey for England and Wales showed 39,000 homophobic hate incidents over the same period. The Equality and Human Rights Commission is launching a campaign to encourage people to report abuse.  Its deputy chair, Caroline Waters, said it was unacceptable that the LGBT community “still face such persistent prejudice, abuse and discrimination”. She said: “We are a country with proud traditions of tolerance and respect but we must not let important progress in areas such as same-sex marriage mask the acute and continuing challenges that still remain. “Researchers in today’s report were told of victims’ fear of not being taken seriously, how they were scared of being ‘outed’ and suspicion and distrust of the authorities. We must all redouble our efforts, and work together to give LGBT communities a stronger voice and put an end to the hatred that is a blight on modern society.” Paul Roberts, the chief executive of the LGBT Consortium, said: “LGBT communities are already working with the police to remove barriers to reporting, and offer practical and emotional support. However, too often LGBT people don’t know they are experiencing hate crime or just shrug it off. “Collectively, we are saying it is time to move on from this. Our message today is recognise hate crime when it happens, report it, and get support when you need it.” The equalities minister, Nicky Morgan, said: “The EHRC has my full support in its campaign to encourage LGB&amp;T people to report hate crimes to the relevant authorities, and they deserve to know that when they report these abhorrent crimes they will be taken seriously and dealt with fairly.” ",2015-06-23T06:01:00Z,"Hate crime is everyday reality for rural LGBT people, study says","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""9ef4f1be16821d370dfc5eb6aaae589ea302c945""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434988385629/7af89674-d830-4c29-a243-49daa51cdbd8-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Rainbow flag"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The author of the report says harassment and verbal abuse was an everyday reality for many lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Jose Jacome/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>",21,Many do not report abuse because of fears that police would not take them seriously or that they would be outed to their families,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434988385921/7af89674-d830-4c29-a243-49daa51cdbd8-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/23/hate-crime-rural-lgbt-people-study,8
"Gay rights activists have welcomed the decriminalisation of homosexuality in Mozambique but said they still face a long struggle for full equality. A penal code that came into force on Monday erased Portuguese colonial laws dating back to 1886 that could condemn anyone “who habitually engages in vices against nature” to three years’ hard labour. The move was largely symbolic since there have been no known prosecutions for homosexuality since Mozambique gained independence 40 years ago last week.  “We do welcome it but we don’t actually see it as something that will bring a change for how LGBT people live in Mozambique,” said Carina Capitine, spokesperson for the country’s only gay rights organisation, Lambda, which lobbied for the change. The group has been fighting for seven years for official recognition from the government. “That is the battle we have next,” Capitine said. “A lot of people are asking about marriage or adoption but we can’t think about that yet. Our registration is the key thing for us. We haven’t heard much but we are all pushing and believe we will have it soon.” Lambda has 40-50 members and provides counselling, legal assistance and health advice. Registration would mean access to funding and tax exemption status, and would be a step towards acceptance for the country’s LGBT community. Mozambique has a reputation for more relaxed social attitudes than many countries in Africa. Capitine added: “We are quite a tolerant people. The LGBT community is not targeted by violent acts as in some African countries. But we do face discrimination here, for example when parents say you cannot live here until you change.” Public displays of same-sex affection are rare but not unknown. “It will depend where you’re going, how you act in general. Some people are more open, some are more shy. It depends where you are and who you are with.” The mainstream media tend to ignore the subject but the internet has provided a platform for raising awareness. Dercio Tsandzana, a leading activist and blogger in Mozambique, said: “In newspapers you can’t find it, in local media they don’t talk about it, but you can go to Facebook and find Lambda: ‘Look for us, we exist.’” He added: “We can’t say the government is open-minded. It is one thing to open laws, another to give recognition to an organisation like Lambda. They don’t say ‘We don’t accept’, but they don’t say ‘We accept’. This is about more than laws. It’s not easy but we have to talk.” Joaquim Chissano, a former Mozambican president, appealed for a change in attitudes in an open letter to African leaders last year. “We can no longer afford to discriminate against people on the basis of age, sex, ethnicity, migrant status, sexual orientation and gender identity, or any other basis – we need to unleash the full potential of everyone,” he wrote. “As an African who has been around a long time, I understand the resistance to these ideas. But I can also step back and see that the larger course of human history, especially of the past century or so, is one of expanding human rights and freedoms.” Same-sex relations are illegal in 36 of the continent’s 54 countries, according to Amnesty International, and punishable by death in Sudan, Nigeria and Mauritania. Anti-gay statements from political leaders are common in Mozambique’s neighbours Zambia and Zimbabwe. But LGBT organisations have recently scored legal victories allowing them to register in Botswana and Kenya, and last year the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights passed a resolution calling on national leaders on the continent to respect the human rights and dignity of LGBT people.  Graeme Reid, director of the LGBT rights programme at Human Rights Watch, said: “We’ve seen small incremental steps towards greater equality in sub-Saharan Africa. If you look at the overall picture of the last 25 years and look at the strength and resilience of LGBT movements, that’s a positive sign. In some ways, the homophobia we see is a reaction against this increased visibility.” He added: “It’s difficult to talk about an overall pattern but we have seen some positive developments over the last 18 months.” Peter Tatchell, a veteran human rights and gay rights campaigner, said of the Mozambique law: “It’s a wonderful development amid the often regressive anti-gay measures being taken by some other African countries like Nigeria, Cameroon, Uganda and the Gambia. “The decriminalisation is the result of long patient lobbying by Mozambican LGBT activists and their African allies. This is the first step towards wider legal protection for LGBT people in Mozambique and for LGBT organisations to receive formal recognition and consultative status with government.” He added: “The pattern across Africa is very uneven. South Africa leads the way. Mozambique has taken a first step in the same direction but most other African countries still criminalise same-sex relations and often ignore homophobic, biphobic and transphobic violence. LGBT human rights defenders in most African countries are at constant risk of arrest and of mob violence.”",2015-06-30T18:32:36Z,Mozambique LGBT activists move on to next battle after anti-gay law scrapped,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""087a2ff016d73b649159a26ab5d0ad6449f15752""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435688960779/28cf3d82-1e6d-4bbb-bc5a-a5381e8da27d-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Rainbow flag"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Lambda’s Carina Capitine: ‘The LGBT community is not targeted by violent acts as in some African countries.

"It wasn’t that long ago – 4 November 2008 – that the US had an election that galvanized a generation of activists to change policies in this country that would have enshrined into law the continued marginalization of a large group of people. I’m not talking about who was elected president, or which political party took the most seats in Congress: rather, a ballot initiative in the state of California, called Proposition 8, passed by a four-point margin that night and successfully amended the state’s constitution by adding language that defined marriage as being between “one man and one woman”.   Related: Gay marriage declared legal across the US in historic supreme court ruling    Now, not fully eight years later, the US supreme court ruled in favor of full marriage equality across America. And while on that night back in 2008, as I considered the long term consequences of California’s newly enshrined discrimination against same-sex couples – including the possibility that the thousands of couples who married in the months prior might have effectively been “divorced” by a voting majority of their neighbors, coworkers and families – I felt faint and ran to the bathroom to throw up, today I am happy for that part of my LGBT community which has gained a well-deserved measure of equality. But I worry that, with full marriage equality, much of the queer community will be left wondering how else to engage with a society that still wants to define who we are – and who in our community will be left to push for full equality for all transgender and queer people, now that this one fight has been won. I fear that our precious movements for social justice and all the remarkable advancements we have made are now vulnerable to being taken over by monied people and institutions, and that those of us for whom same-sex marriage rights brings no equality will be slowly erased from our movement and our history. The unexpected shock of a marriage equality loss in California in 2008 – a state that I, like many others, ignorantly deemed “too liberal” to actually pass such a measure – brought millions of people together to focus on marriage equality – crystallizing a previously fractured LGBT rights movement that had seemed to have lost its way politically. The purpose of the movement was to educate and promote the equality of all people. Transgender folks have been part of the push for LGBT equality from the beginning, and we’ve spoken with loud and intelligent voices, and have found political and personal success and advancement all over the world. We fought police discrimination during the riots of Compton Cafeteria in San Francisco in 1966, the Stonewall Inn in 1969 and the White Night in San Francisco in 1979. We have been inspired by leaders from Sylvia Rivera and Miss Major, and from Janet Mock to Laverne Cox. We have created political organizations for ourselves, like the Street Transvestites Action Revolutionaries (Star) to Sylvia Rivera Law Project and Black &amp; Pink. But despite our successes and our participation in the struggle for LGBT equality, there are still queer and trans folks who struggle every single day for the right to define themselves, to access gender-appropriate healthcare and to live without harassment by other people, the police or the government. Many queer and trans people live – and lived – in our prison and jails, in our homeless shelters, in run-down houses and apartment buildings, and on the corners of every major city. Marriage equality doesn’t help them; and the potential loss of momentum for trans/queer rights after this win could well hurt them. I had the extraordinary honor to come out a trans woman on 22 August 2013, the day after a military judge sentenced me to 35 years in prison. Though not present myself, my attorney at the time, David Coombs – without giving the Today show staff any notice until several minutes beforehand – read a statement from me in which I asked that they announce to the world that I am a trans woman, refer to me with female pronouns and use my name, Chelsea. I also announced my intent to seek gender-confirming healthcare treatment while in prison. For me, this was an incredibly empowering moment: nobody can control or define our identities unless we let them, and so I chose to come out and to define myself – nothing more. In the two years since, I am always awestruck and inspired by the queer and trans kids out there all over the world who reach out to me and send letters from very real places like Noblesville, Indiana, Arklow, Ireland and Abeokuta, Nigeria.    Related: 'Love is love': Obama lauds gay marriage activists in hailing 'a victory for America'    We do have to, as a movement, give hope to these kids, and especially young trans youth like Leelah Alcorn, who committed suicide last year after leaving a devastating indictment of the world that she experienced, or Islan Nettles, who was murdered on the streets of New York in 2013. It’s hope that my younger self, who, like many trans/queer kids, struggled to survive while living homeless in Chicago in 2006, could’ve used. We need to send a powerful message to the world in a unified voice: that we can fight for social justice for everyone, everywhere and change the world, not just get married. We can continue to build our communities and address the root causes of queer and trans poverty and deaths. We can work to get queer and trans people out of the prisons and jails and off the streets, and to improve our access to housing, education, employment and gender-confirming healthcare. As Harvey Milk – the first openly gay politician in America who was assassinated in 1978 – said after getting letters from kid: “We gotta give ’em hope.”We can do all of these things, but only if today is just the first of many victories for LGBT rights. My name is Chelsea Manning, I am trans woman and I am here to recruit you to the next stage in the equality movement. Join me.

"On the anniversary of its decisions striking down laws banning “sodomy” and a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act that prevented legally-married same-sex couples from obtaining federal recognition, the Supreme Court on Friday declared a full national right to same-sex marriage.  The court’s decision was 5-4, with Justice Anthony Kennedy writing the decision and joined by the court’s four Democratic nominees. But though the conservative dissents will garner the most attention from critics, it’s actually the majority opinion that may cause LGBT rights advocates the most headaches in the years to come.   Related: 'We did it, babe!' – love won the day on the same-sex marriage decision | Steven W Thrasher    While Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas are wrong about same-sex marriage, they weren’t wrong about Kennedy’s majority opinion, which leaves a lot to be desired. All of Kennedy’s same-sex marriage opinions have all contained passages whose legal reach exceeds their rhetorical grasp, and even people sympathetic to Kennedy’s conclusions will wince in recognition when reading Scalia’s snarky lines about Kennedy’s “straining-to-be-memorable passages” and “inspirational pop-philosophy.” Much worse than its aesthetic problems, however, is where Kennedy leaves equal protection law as it pertains to LGBT rights more generally. As with Kennedy’s Doma opinion – about which I wrote that he “flirt[ed] awkwardly with federalism, due process and equal protection rationales without ever quite summoning up the courage to invite one to the prom” – he maddeningly continued in this opinion to vaguely invoke both equal protection and due process theories without clarifying the applicable standard when it comes to LGBT rights more generally. “Each concept – liberty and equal protection – leads to a stronger understanding of the other,” asserted Kennedy. The problem with Kennedy’s judicial vagueness is that public officials and lower courts need to know whether classifications based on sexual orientation should be subject to heightened scrutiny, like those based on race or gender, or whether such classifications require only a “rational basis”, like economic regulation. If heightened scrutiny applies, states can only use sexual orientation classifications in law if it they are closely related to a compelling state interest – a test states usually fail. If states need only a “rational basis,” courts are generally very deferential to the state. After Friday’s opinion, it seems obvious that heightened scrutiny is being applied in practice, but Kennedy inexplicably refuses to say so. The refusal to define sexual orientation as subject to heightened scrutiny will lead to unnecessary confusion, and possibly permit federal and state judges to deny LBGT rights claims that even Kennedy might think should be upheld. By not being more specific about his rationale for forcing all states to recognize and perform same-sex marriages, Kennedy leaves open the legal possibility that marriage is the only form of discrimination against same-sex people that is covered by the 14th Amendment. But LGBT people face many other types of discrimination – in public accommodations and in employment, for example – that now may have to be fought out case by never-ending case in the lower courts. Still, the dissenting opinions are at least as interesting than Kennedy’s majority, because they reveal how much American attitudes towards LGBT people have changed over the years.  For instance, for the first time, the dissents hold substantive opposition to same-sex marriage rights at arm’s length: Roberts’s opinion (joined in full by Scalia and Thomas) began by arguing that proponents of the right to same-sex marriage “make strong arguments rooted in social policy and considerations of fairness” and concluded by saying that “If you are among the many Americans – of whatever sexual orientation – who favor expanding same-sex marriage, by all means celebrate today’s decision.” Justice Scalia’s dissent observed that “The substance of today’s decree is not of immense personal importance to me.” Only Alito refused to distance himself from the policy (and personal) consequences of his legal conclusions. But that even Scalia felt a need to express a marginally-tolerant view of LGBT people helps to explain why the court recognized a right to same-sex marriage. Contrast the dissents to the majority opinion in the 1986 sodomy-ban case Bowers v Hardwick, when the court declared that the idea of a right to engage in consensual same-sex intimacy “facetious”, and Chief Justice Burger’s concurrence asserted that “To hold that the act of homosexual sodomy is somehow protected as a fundamental right would be to cast aside millennia of moral teaching.” In Romer v Evans, Scalia himself compared laws that discriminated against LGBT people to laws against “murder … or cruelty to animals” and asserted that the state could express “animus” towards their conduct; in Lawrence v Texas he railed against “the so-called homosexual agenda.”  Scalia’s dissent on Friday was markedly more muted: space he would have once taken up complaining about the pernicious effects of LGBT people on American political culture was spent instead trying out material in case the now-shuttered nightclubs in the Catskills reopen and need a “take my wife, please” comedy act: “one would think Freedom of Intimacy is abridged rather than expanded by marriage. Ask the nearest hippie” he wrote, followed by “[marriage] constricts, rather than expands, what one can prudently say.”  Rather than making policy arguments or railing against LGBT people, Roberts and Scalia focused on judicial restraint. “Do not celebrate the Constitution,” said Justice Roberts, “[i]t had nothing to do with” Friday’s outcome. “This is a naked judicial claim to legislative – indeed, super-legislative – power; a claim fundamentally at odds with our system of government,” averred Scalia. Their arguments about judicial discretion are highly unconvincing: as long as there is judicial review, judges will have the discretion to make judgments about the meaning of broadly worded constitutional clauses in ways that have important policy consequences. And the pleas for judicial modesty are particularly hard to take coming from today’s dissenters, all of whom just two years ago put their names to an opinion gutting the Voting Rights Act based on a judicially invented theory of states’ rights last seen in a 1857 opinion in which Chief Justice Roger Taney found that Congress could not ban slavery in its territories and African Americans could never be American citizens. But while today’s opinion would have almost certainly been much better had Kennedy assigned it to Ruth Bader Ginsburg rather than keeping it for himself (as is his prerogative as the senior justice in the majority), it still gets to the right conclusion. As frustrating as his opinion might end up being for LGBT more generally, on Friday, Kennedy was still the swing vote in the Brown v Board decision of LGBT rights. Today, his recognition of one of the fundamental rights of same-sex couples in all 50 states is what matters most; if they have to come back to him for the others, at least it’s clear to lawyers where he’ll likely stand.",2015-06-26T17:40:05Z,Does the same-sex marriage ruling mean trouble for other LGBT rights cases?,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""566f5a08005e0585bdbdd6bf6a0c6b7afd3d6a98""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/566f5a08005e0585bdbdd6bf6a0c6b7afd3d6a98/269_199_3324_1996/1000.jpg"" alt=""same sex couple texas"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Jaque Roberts, left, and her partner of 31 years, Carmelita Cabello, right, show off their marriage license in Austin, Texas. </span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Eric Gay/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>",24,The language of the ruling means that states cannot discriminate against same-sex marriages.

"When Sir Tim Hunt’s comments about women in science broke, one element in particular jumped out at me. Hunt was, he said, in favour of gender-segregated laboratories as a way of sidestepping the mess arising from scientists in love. The notion that same-sex groups would limit romance seemed rather odd, as the first woman I ever dated was on the same molecular biochemistry degree course as me. We never worked in the same lab - who knows what terrible state science might be in now if we had? – but, though a year apart, had courses, lecturers, and textbooks in common. At this distance I genuinely can’t remember whether I talked about enzyme structures as a chat-up line but, knowing my younger self, we shouldn’t rule it out. This is not an article about Tim Hunt – there are loads of those already, and I recommend Alice Bell’s piece at openDemocracy or, indeed, the UCL Provost’s own statement. Instead, this is about what it means for queer scientists to, yet again, be overlooked in discussions of scientific careers. And it feels like a pretty important moment to have a think about what happens when the acronyms of STEM and LGBT meet each other. Same sex marriage continues to be equalized, most recently in the United States and Ireland; the term ‘cisgender’ has now made it into the OED after rattling around various journals for many years; and numerous tech companies had a presence at many of the Pride parades that took place this weekend gone. There has been extensive, necessary, and uphill work to advance gender equality in science, involving years of sustained pressure through research, activism, and policy engagement. Yet there are few similar pushes for equality around sexual minorities, in part due to absence of data around LGBT scientists. The Royal Society has collected material about the gender, ethnicity, class, disability and age of the UK’s scientific workforce as part of their diversity work — information around sexuality is notably lacking. In the lab, invisibility can persist if scientists understandably choose not to be out to their colleagues – a decision which can be affected by the working environment itself. The small and important body of work about the experiences of LGBT scientists, indicates that that they experience similar “chilling” effects as sexual minority academics across the university – “Don’t ask, don’t tell” in a mortarboard. In their work on the academic climate for LGBT STEM faculty, Diane Bilimoria and Abigail J Stewart note that these effects can include discrimination, invisibility, tokenism, stereotyping, isolation and exclusion. These experiences are not universal by any means; but, when they do happen it can be exhausting, adding up to a hostile work environment which affects stress levels and performance. The structures of science careers The structures of science can exacerbate these issues. For one, even talking about LGBT issues in the lab can be difficult. Though bound up in politics and culture, science is framed as objective and neutral; a meritocratic place where individual identities are irrelevant to progression in the field. As we’ve seen from discussions around gender and STEM, this is rubbish: as Erin Cech and Tom Waidzunas note in their research around LGBT engineering students , if sexual equality if seen to be an irrelevant topic of conversation, so too are associated discussions around power and discrimination. Then there’s the structure of scientific careers themselves: the long training period; the series of short-term contracts; and the power distance between the few lab heads and the many temporary staff. Social relations bind it all together, with access to the keys to the kingdom – grants, publications, jobs, collaborations - dependent on the judgment of one’s peers. With job security low, funding cuts high, and social approval critical for progression, young queer scientists may feel that, in the face of the ‘postdocalypse’, coming out is a risk which they simply can’t afford to take during the early, fragile stages of their careers. On top of all of that, there’s the travel. As with other academics, junior scientists are expected to go from post to post, to wherever the highly specialized work is. Researchers in the geographies of sexuality have identified the importance of particular regions for the social and political lives – and safety - of queer individuals; yet these spaces do not necessarily align with the best institutions to study (for example) paleoethnobotany or theoretical plasma physics. Even a supportive environment can mean separation from loved ones. Following his time at Bletchley Park, Alan Turing took up a post in Manchester where there was a small gay community “centred on the BBC, the university, and the Manchester Guardian” (as his biographer Andrew Hodges describes). Turing chose to avoid that crowd in favour of heading back south to spend time with his partner Neville, a statistics postgraduate at Cambridge University. Turing’s experiences highlight the ‘two-body’ problem in academia; that is, the difficulty that couples have in finding jobs close together. The unhappy twist for same-sex couples is that in order even travel across borders together to hunt for work, their relationship needs to be recognised by the state. One of the good things about the spread of marriage equality is that queer scientists now have the option bringing same-sex partners along for the ride (even if the job market remains grim).  No one scientist, no single experience One of the positive things to emerge from the Tim Hunt incident is that large institutions including UCL and the Royal Society have publically stated their commitment to gender equality and diversity in science. At a point where LGBT civil rights have hit the mainstream, it is important not to see this as the end of the road. There are already several queer science networks and mentors which do fine work, such as LGBT CERN; oSTEM; NOGLSTP; and Gravity&amp;Gender. However, in a system as hierarchical as science, explicit commitment to inclusion needs to come from the top, going beyond ‘If you liked it then you should have put a rainbow on it’ pinkwashed offerings to actual hard action. Marriage equality is a start, but it doesn’t cover issues around employment protection or healthcare access, issues which science institutions might be well placed to consider. The stigma and discrimination described above are unevenly distributed. Cech and Waidzunas describe how black and minority ethnic (BME) queer students have to negotiate both racial and sexual stereotypes about their abilities. Lesbian engineering students contend with both sexism, and assumptions about their technical skills based on stereotypes around butchness. Whilst little research has been conducted explicitly around trans STEM students, broader NUS work addressing life on campus indicates experiences including harassment, safety, and fear of loss of financial support . There is no single experience of being an LGBT scientist. The acronym encompasses a huge array of identities which also intersect massively with elements of race, gender, class, disability, and age. Extending science equality work into LGBT spaces means recognizing and responding to these differences.",2015-06-29T21:35:29Z,Queer Laboratory Life: Recognising the work of LGBT scientists,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""ea03881ae503c54e276009562bf48c125f4ecadb""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435611798450/dcd19571-26f2-4327-ab37-d2e866580738-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""LGBT scientists face particular challenges in their careers"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">LGBT scientists face particular challenges in their careers.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Georgina Voss</span> </figcaption> </figure>",25,"With marriage equality in the news, Georgina Voss argues that science institutions need to extend their diversity initiatives to LGBT scientists<br>",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435611798868/92df0aa3-c430-4e24-aded-8c34d3395e3d-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2015/jun/29/queer-laboratory-life-recognising-the-work-of-lgbt-scientists,4
"When Lane Deines was a student at Kearney high school in Nebraska, he never seriously considered coming out. “I was fearful,” said Deines, now 26. “I would watch what I was doing, how I was holding stuff, to make sure nobody knew.” Nathan Leach graduated last month from the same high school, located in the center of the US. He came out when he was a freshman and was a member of the school’s gender sexuality alliance club, and he said most people were “very, very fine” with him coming out. “It warms my heart,” said Deines. “I never thought I’d see the day that Kearney high school had a Gay Straight Alliance.” Leach is entering adulthood knowing that he can legally marry in 36 states, Washington DC and Guam – though not in his home state of Nebraska, where same-sex marriage is illegal. Both are waiting for same-sex marriage to be recognized in the state where they were raised. This could happen in the next few days, pending a decision by the supreme court on the constitutional right to same-sex marriage. And even as LGBT people actively campaign for a host of other rights that are arguably more important to LGBT youth, the unexpectedly swift move toward nationwide marriage equality has already improved the lives of many LGBT students. “All these changes and every moment of victory for the LGBT community has an incredible impact on the lives of LGBT students and in fact all youth,” said Eliza Byard, the executive director of the Gay, Lesbian &amp; Straight Education Network (GLSEN).     Lane Deines. Photograph: Handout    Since 1999, GLSEN has released a biennial survey of the climate for LGBT students. It shows that from 2007 to 2013, LGBT students have reported a steady decline of incidents of verbal and physical harassment and of physical assault. Though this is important progress for LGBT youth, nearly 56% of LGBT students still reported to GLSEN that they felt unsafe in school because of their sexuality or gender identity in 2013. This, alongside data showing 74% of LGBT students were verbally harassed and 56% said that their school had anti-LGBT policies – all of which can result in absences from school and depression. This is particularly true for middle school students – usually children between the ages of 11 and 13 – who report more incidents of bullying and typically have less access to LGBT-related school resources. In December, 12-year-old Ronin Shimizu killed himself in Folsom, a suburb of Sacramento, California. His parents had shuttled him through several schools in the area to get him away from the bullying he experienced at each school. A family friend told the Sacramento Bee that the child was persistently taunted as the only male member of a junior-high cheerleading team. The incident pains Lance Chih, a gay man who isolated himself as much as possible during his first years at Folsom high school because of anxiety about his sexuality. But during Chih’s sophomore year, a fellow student told him he should be killed for being gay and in another instance, a glass bottle was thrown at him while he was in a bathroom stall. He tried to kill himself three times. “I was terrified to go to the bathroom, I wouldn’t go to lunches,” he said. He felt that the school was not responding adequately to his complaints about bullying and, with the help of the ACLU, filed suit against the school, hoping it would push the district to develop a more comprehensive system for LGBT students. “Reading about that [Shimizu’s suicide], knowing that I might have been able to stop that, hurt,” Chih said. Chih remains a committed LGBT rights activist, and now works in the capitol to push for aid for homeless LGBT youth and to improve transgender rights. Those battles became easier in June 2013, when same-sex marriage was made legal in California, he said. After years of legal back and forth that saw same-sex marriage made legal, banned and made legal again, a landmark supreme court case finally overturned the state’s ban. “It means more than what I think a lot of people realize,” said Chih. He is grateful that with the same-sex marriage right taken care of, activists can spend more time dedicated to issues like homelessness.  Campaigning for other LGBT rights issues has become more urgent as activists prepare for the potential backlash if same-sex marriage becomes the law of the land. “Right now we are facing a critical inflection point, because, should there be a victory of this magnitude for LGBT people, you will see an increasingly desperate backlash,” she said. “And at a moment when so many legislatures are in the hands of Republican majorities – and sometimes supermajorities – you see unbelievably unconstitutional action in response.” Republicans have been pushing for so-called religious freedom bills, which many viewed as authorizing businesses to deny service to LGBT people. In turn, LGBT activists are pushing harder for expanded discrimination protections to prevent LGBT people from getting kicked out of their homes or fired because of their gender identity or sexuality. This is a prime concern in schools, where students may turn to LGBT teachers, or at the very least, allies, to help them when they may not find support elsewhere. “It is an incredibly powerful experience, even if it is internal, to know there is someone there for you,” Byard said.     Retired teacher Gloria Talcove. Photograph: Handout    For LGBT students in a very conservative part of the already conservative state of South Carolina, that person was Gloria Talcove, a former Spanish teacher at Irmo high school. “There is a church on every corner, just about,” she said of the Columbia suburb where the school is located. In 2007, she accepted an offer to become advisor of the school’s Gay Straight Alliance – one of about 8,000 similarly minded clubs that exist in high schools and middle schools. Under federal law, any school that receives money from the federal government cannot block these types of clubs from being created – an impasse that has led to vicious protests, administrators pressuring teachers to not sponsor the club and Irmo’s high school principal to resign. Talcove, meanwhile, received voicemail messages from people telling her that she should leave South Carolina and go straight to hell. “I don’t know how gay kids survived before,” she said. The safety of LGBT students became a concern for her when the slang phrase “That’s so gay,” became popular and she saw certain students shirk in their seat whenever other students used it as an insult. “I remember my heart just breaking, seeing kids react this way,” Talcove said. She then began reading up on gay issues, and realized that it was likely that there were LGBT students in each of her classes. She retired in 2012, but still keeps in touch with the school’s GSA, which is in its eighth year and now easily finds sponsors for its activities. Talcove believes the club’s persistence has “3000%” improved the experience of LGBT Irmo high school students. “It made it not okay to malign people,” said Talcove. Research shows that supportive adults like Talcove are essential to a young person’s development. This is especially true for LGBT youth, who may find a supportive atmosphere at school, but not a home. Kearney high school’s Leach left home his junior year partly because his stepfather was against him being gay. But at school, he said it “wasn’t very hard” to identify as a gay man. He partially credits this ability to assimilate with being more masculine than the stereotyped image of gay men, a characteristic other people the Guardian spoke with also said made their experience in school easier. “A lot of homophobic comments are targeted to those who are more effeminate,” he said.  Leach also said that it is easy to get lost in a large high school like his, where he would associate with welcoming groups like speech and debate, but avoid sports teams. He’s headed to the University of Nebraska in the fall to study political science, a subject he practiced in high school while campaigning for expanded LGBT health rights and anti-discrimination laws. Leach remembers being a sophomore in high school, the year before he moved out, and walking through Nebraska’s state capitol with his boyfriend. “Just walking through those halls and knowing that we are gay and that our relationship isn’t accepted by the state, was a very powerful, a very powerful sense of disenfranchisement,” he said. “So it’s very amazing talking to people who a year ago would say it might be legal in five years and to know that that decision is going to be made or that a step forward is likely to be made.” This change is remarkable to Deines, 26, who did not come out until April 2013 and never seriously considered coming out while in high school – where he was constantly afraid that people would figure out that he was gay. “I was fearful,” Deines said. “I would watch what I was doing, how I was holding stuff, to make sure nobody knew.”  ",2015-06-25T11:30:01Z,What same-sex marriage reform could mean for the LGBT youths of America,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""6c9920fc768a92aa625fd552285c3fd89af02db5""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435187948649/aed2e183-620e-44d1-b16f-5f0445c2b2e4-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Nathan Leach and UNK Queer-Striaght Alliance president Tiff Weekly​ at the Kearney Pride Walk 2015."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Nathan Leach and UNK Queer-Striaght Alliance president Tiff Weekly​ at the Kearney Pride Walk 2015.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>",26,"Coming out in middle American high schools was once unthinkable, but LGBT youths are better off since the swift progress of nationwide marriage equality",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435187948809/6bc7409e-6422-424c-9148-9a4892802327-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/25/same-sex-marriage-lgbt-youths-america,1
"Forty years ago last week, Bella Abzug introduced the Equality Act in Congress, which would have amended the Civil Rights Act to include protections from discrimination based on sexual orientation in housing, public accommodations and employment. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act, or ENDA, which covers employment discrimination, was introduced 20 years later, in 1994. It&apos;s now 2014, and gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people still have no national law that prevents employers, landlords, hoteliers or even restaurant owners from discriminating against us because of our sexual orientations or gender identities. It&apos;s long past time to change that, in sweeping fashion – not just one more bill. This year, organizers used the anniversary of the Equality Act to launch a campaign calling for better protections against discrimination than ENDA would offer. Queer Nation launched a Twitter campaign, #ENDAisNOTequal, and Matt Foreman, former executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, released this statement:  It&apos;s pathetic that four decades have gone by without Congress extending basic civil rights protections to LGBT Americans. It&apos;s even more pathetic that what&apos;s left of Bella Abzug&apos;s comprehensive legislation is ENDA – a small-bore bill that is now riddled with giveaways to anti-gay forces, including a religious exemption big enough for an 18-wheeler to cruise through. It&apos;s time to pull the plug on this essentially lifeless corpse and demand full equality under the federal civil rights statutes.  National LGBT leaders need to agree that we deserve better than ENDA.  This weakened legislation doesn&apos;t address discrimination in housing, public accommodations, education or federal programs. And it would only extend to us the employment protections that the majority of Americans think LGBT people already have – that&apos;s how far Congress is behind the mainstream. It&apos;s finally time to push for the broad protections that we actually need. But ENDA holds a lot of symbolic power – transgender people have had to fight to even be included in this legislation - so it can be difficult to give up on, even in favor of something far more comprehensive. Transgender people face the highest rate of employment discrimination of anyone under the LGBT umbrella – twice the national average. The numbers are even worse for trans women, and trans people of color face discrimination at four times the national average.  National LGBT organizations have made ENDA the carrot that is dangled in front of the trans community to prove that our issues are being prioritized – when, in fact, these organizations know that even a watered-down ENDA will not pass. House Speaker John Boehner has said that he will not even bring ENDA up for a vote, because he does not consider the legislation necessary.  I have remained silent during recent pushes for ENDA, as I haven&apos;t seen a reason to whip up the grassroots about weak legislation that won&apos;t pass. But several national organizations have sent out &quot;action alerts&quot; about it because there&apos;s nothing else on their legislative agenda. (They even, embarrassingly, told their mailing list members to contact Congress about ENDA during last year&apos;s government shutdown.) Meanwhile, LGBT rights opponents have consistently, specifically targeted trans women – who face the highest rates of discrimination by all measures, not just employment – when fighting to prevent any movement on non-discrimination, be it ENDA, protections in schools, or anything else. Anti-LGBT organizations and even Fox News recently spread the &quot;bathroom panic argument&quot;, fomenting unwarranted fear that non-discrimination laws will lead to trans women preying on cisgender women in bathrooms.  The reality is that trans women are just women, and we need places to relieve ourselves in private – a basic right almost everyone else takes for granted. And, counter to the conservative arguments, trans women are very likely to experience harassment and even violence simply for trying to use the bathroom. This pernicious fear-mongering is dangerous and frustrating to deal with, and its targeting of those most likely to face discrimination has led to trans issues being quietly eliminated from non-discrimination legislation before.  Since it is finally becoming less and less politically acceptable to throw trans women under the bus at all – and, broad or narrow, any legislation we get behind isn&apos;t going to get a fair hearing in the Republican-controlled House – I see no reason not to push for everything we can get, rather than compromising from the start. Non-discrimination legislation is starting to gain traction at the state level, though you can still be fired for being gay in a majority of states. As with ENDA, trans people have often seen our protections &quot;compromised&quot; out of state-based legislation – so we can be fired for being ourselves in even more states than that – but we are starting to see pushes for more inclusive protections. We need a national strategy that includes both these state-based efforts and comprehensive protections at federal level – and, to get that, we need to, as a unified front, push for legislation that actually has teeth.",2014-05-19T13:37:56Z,LGBT people still need basic civil rights – not just watered-down legislation,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-a5dae845-4556-4422-b949-dd5b4fe37fa5""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/19/1400461255446/bbb78b2c-0de2-4a2b-819e-ed77fc501fc5-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""laverne cox"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">LGBT organizations have made ENDA the carrot dangled in front of the trans community to prove that our issues are being prioritized.

"Gavin Grimm, a 16-year-old transgender boy in Virginia who was barred by his high school from using male restrooms and directed instead to segregated “biological gender” facilities, went before a federal judge on Monday to argue that he is the victim of unlawful sex discrimination. The case of Gavin Grimm versus the Gloucester County school board is at the forefront of what is being hailed by LGBT activists as a civil rights movement for transgender equality. Its outcome will be closely watched by several states – including Michigan, where a similar federal lawsuit is under way, and Florida, Kentucky, Minnesota and Texas, where Republican legislators have tried to introduce “bathroom bills” that would restrict transgender students to restrooms and locker rooms in the gender they were assigned at birth.   Related: 'I am Alena': life as a trans woman where survival means living as Christopher    Grimm is described in court filings by his lawyers, the American Civil Liberties Union, as a “typical teenager who is articulate and intelligent, reads broadly, loves his dog and cats, and enjoys hanging out with his friends”. He was diagnosed with gender dysphoria – the condition where a person’s self-identity and physical gender are unaligned – in his freshman year. He was given medical and therapeutic treatment, an important part of which is help in transitioning to the gender to which he identifies – male – in all social settings. That included Gloucester High School, where he is now about to enter junior year. School staff initially supported his transition; in his sophomore year they agreed to change his name in the school record and allowed him for seven weeks to use the male restrooms. The decision was overwhelmingly accepted by other students and there is no evidence of any complaints during that period from anyone at the school. Complaints, however, did begin to come into the school from adults – including some parents and even some local people who had no children at the institution. Under pressure, the school board convened meetings to discuss the issue at which anger towards Grimm’s use of the male restrooms was publicly unleashed. Some of the speakers addressed Grimm as a “girl” and a “young lady”, ignoring his clear stated preference to be referred to with male pronouns. One person called him a “freak”; another likened him to a dog wanting to urinate on a fire hydrant. Several speakers warned that by allowing this one student into male bathrooms it would open the floodgates to sexual assault and breaches of privacy. Despite the embarrassment of having his personal bathroom habits discussed in front of strangers, Grimm himself addressed the meeting. He said: “All I want to do is be a normal child and use the restroom in peace. I did not ask to be this way, and it’s one of the most difficult things anyone can face. This could be your child. I’m just a human. I’m just a boy.” In the wake of the meetings, the school board voted to change its rules over the use of boys’ and girls’ restrooms and locker rooms so that in future they “shall be limited to the corresponding biological genders”. Under the new regulations, students with “sincere gender identity issues shall be provided an alternative private facility”. In Grimm’s case, that means he has to make use of three segregated single-stall restrooms apart from the other facilities in the school. At Monday’s hearing in the US district court for the eastern district of Virginia the ACLU argued on the student’s behalf that such treatment was demeaning and humiliating, providing a daily reminder to everyone in the institution that he was “different”. ACLU lawyers argued before the court that the requirement that he either uses female facilities contrary to his gender identity or the segregated restrooms was a violation of Title IX of the education amendments of 1972 that prohibits discrimination on grounds of sex. That includes, the ACLU argued, gender identity or transgender status. The judge hearing the case, Robert Doumar, dismissed the Title IX claim on Monday. Despite that setback he indicated that he was likely to allow the case to proceed to discovery over a concurrent claim that Grimm’s constitutional right to equal protection under the law had been violated. The ACLU’s Joshua Block said after the hearing: “We are happy that the judge indicated he is likely to allow our equal protection claim to go forward. School officials must treat all students equally and may not demean and stigmatize transgender students by relegating them to separate restrooms from their peers.” In its defense, the Gloucester County school board has argued that Grimm is still “biologically and anatomically a female. Plaintiff has not provided medical evidence or medical testimony that Plaintiff is a boy or that he has male chromosomes.” The board insists that the transgender student is not likely to suffer irreparable harm from the new restroom regulations as the school has introduced “three single-stall bathrooms for [Grimm] and any other student to use”.",2015-07-27T18:30:24Z,Transgender boy barred from men's room testifies in sex discrimination case,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""0bb08e95a12b82d4768ce2c1fe2d065b3d06d700""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/27/1438021781478/52c86826-4e5b-4bf4-8599-3af14ff14fa3-bestSizeAvailable.png"" alt=""Gavin Grimm"" width=""300"" height=""180"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Gavin Grimm: ‘All I want to do is be a normal child and use the restroom in peace.’</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: ACLU</span> </figcaption> </figure>",28,"Gavin Grimm, 16, argues he is the victim of unlawful discrimination in case at center of what is being hailed as new push for equality in civil rights movement",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/27/1438021781858/91f0b326-31b0-4231-99b2-c71157e17ec8-140x84.png,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/27/transgender-boy-high-school-bathroom-discrimination-case,1
"Jack ran away from home after his family started planning a forced marriage to “cure” him of his homosexuality. Struggling to reconcile his Muslim faith with his sexual orientation, he had already been experiencing severe mental health problems. After waiting almost nine hours for an assessment, Jack was initially refused emergency accommodation by a London local authority, despite being homeless and having mental health conditions and learning difficulties. The local authority attempted to have Jack forcibly removed from its offices, only relenting after the Albert Kennedy Trust (AKT), a charity that supports homeless lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 16- to 25-year-olds, advocated on his behalf.    Instead of finding accommodation our staff now have to recommend how to safely sleep on the street  Bob Green     Sadly, Jack’s case is far from unique. A recent survey by the trust shows that LGBT people make up 24% of the youth homeless population.  They are overrepresented, according to the trust, because many are rejected by families unable to come to terms with their gender identity or sexual orientation. With more violent homophobic crimes being reported, LGBT people are also at greater risk of violence, sexual exploitation and mental health problems when they become homeless. Discrimination Discrimination is rife, particularly in employment and access to housing, and LGBT people have been disproportionately affected by high youth unemployment, cuts to public services and a lack affordable housing options. Many public services are ill-equipped to deal with LGBT people. Staff at the trust describe many examples, including trans people misgendered without an apology; and young people fleeing domestic abuse, afraid to seek help from housing professionals who are too quick to contact homophobic parents.  LGBT rough sleepers, quoted in a 2014 Stonewall Housing report, face discrimination when trying to access homelessness services. “I was told to keep my sexuality to myself,” one man says of his experience staying in a hostel. Another adds: “One service thought that sexuality wasn’t an issue and suggested I could go back home. They didn’t understand that I would experience violence.” Homelessness presents particular difficulties for transgender people. In the report, one trans-male describes the ordeal of trying to find a safe place to inject hormones, or even just to wash. “There were no locks on the doors of the showers. You had people walk in on you. I would wash as much as I could and then go to McDonald’s to wash personal areas because I couldn’t take the chance, and it would have put me in a lot of danger.”   Related: Lesbian and gay groups face funding crisis | Patrick Strudwick      Increased demand Demand for LGBT-specific services is increasing. Gay people are twice as likely to experience mental health issues, but cuts to local government and charities are compounded by cuts to services like mental health.  Under the coalition government, people under 35 are restricted to claiming only enough housing benefit to live in a shared house, forcing some LGBT people to live in unsafe places, with potentially homophobic or transphobic housemates. Conservative plans to abolish housing benefit for under-21s could force young people into staying with abusive or homophobic families. There are also fewer safe social spaces: many gay bars and venues – a source of support and advice for vulnerable LGBT people with nowhere else to go – are shutting down due to soaring rents. The cumulative effect has been devastating.  “I have worked in housing for 25 years and for the very first time I have been hearing of young people suffering from malnutrition,” says Bob Green, chief executive of Stonewall Housing, a London-based LGBT housing advice and support provider. For the first time his organisation has been referring people to foodbanks, to the Terrence Higgins Trust hardship fund for people living with HIV and to London Catalyst, which can help people experiencing benefit sanctions. Cuts to funding Charities have been able to pick up some of the slack left by the public sector, but relentless cuts to local authority budgets mean council commissioners don’t have the money to fund as many specific projects and training, and LGBT concerns are easily dropped in harder times. A 2014 TUC report found that some LGBT voluntary and community organisations, already underfunded compared with mainstream charities, have faced up to 50% cuts to their income. Green has already witnessed a 30% reduction in funding from four London boroughs three years ago, and could soon face a further 50% cut. “It’s fair to say we’re struggling,” says Green. “We will have to reduce services in the coming year. We may face closure in the years ahead.” Funding for Stonewall Housing is now largely project-based, with little left for the day-to-day running of the charity. More payment-by-results contracts mean staff spend more time filing reports for funders, leaving less time to tackle the causes of LGBT homelessness. Green describes the situation as heartbreaking: “ Whereas before there would be more housing or hostel options, our staff now have to end conversations recommending how someone can sleep on the street more safely,” says Green. “We are living in 2015 and we’re advising people how to sleep on the streets.” What would help? One answer could be organisations working together. A good example is the London Youth Gateway, a one-stop shop for young people at risk of homelessness, where they can access support from Stonewall Housing, training and advice from New Horizon Youth Centre and Alone in London, and emergency accommodation from Depaul UK.   Related: Safe houses offer sanctuary to LGBT youngsters in Manchester and London | Claudia Cahalane    AKT, in a joint venture with housing association Circle 33, provides the only emergency safe house for young LGBT people in London. The Purple Door project has saved local authorities £1.5m since its launch in 2013, by taking the pressure off housing and social services. But despite glimmers of good practice, Stonewall’s Green says there is not enough clever commissioning from local government, and that the voluntary sector is locked out of decision-making. Local authorities also have no mandate to record the sexual orientation or gender identity of those accessing services, making it difficult to map demand or work on prevention.  Lucy Bowyer, supported housing manager at AKT, says this is fixable. “We’d like local authorities to record LGBT youth homelessness. That’s really easy to do. It can be on the initial assessment form when young people present as homeless,” she explains. AKT is also calling for local authorities to train more of their staff, so they can understand the needs of LGBT young homeless people. “Not enough staff realise that LGBT is a specific issue that can cause problems in itself for young people and further isolate them,” says Bowyer. Green agrees. “If they [local authorities] talked to us and involved us, I believe fewer people would fall through the cracks,” he says. “My worry is that if organisations like ours aren’t around, who’s going to be there to challenge them to improve? If we didn’t exist tomorrow, who would be sticking up for LGBT rough sleepers?” Have you experienced discrimination in housing services?

"Apple’s gay CEO Tim Cook wrote that Indiana’s recently passed “religious freedom” law “isn’t a political issue”, but using a fake demand to protect religious freedom – which has been secure since the First Amendment was passed in 1791 – to justify discrimination against queers is about as political as you can get. So if Apple is serious about making life better for LGBT people, it should use some of its cold, hard cash as the most valued corporation in human history, hire some effective lobbyists and send them out en masse to repeal these cockamamie anti-gay laws. And while we’re at it, Gay Inc – which has spent millions on obtaining for us the right to marry – needs to end stop asking for fucking crumbs and finally embrace a full court lobbying campaign to add sexual orientation and gender identity to the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, to end this bullshit once and for all. It might sound cynical to suggest using lobbying, that evil way of conducting government business which subverts democracy, to achieve LGBT equality. But in a political battle, the most efficient way to get something accomplished is to lobby lawmakers. Waiting for federal courts to undo Indiana’s or any of the 20 states with anti-equality “Religious Freedom Restoration Acts” will take years or decades, because – like so much other goddamn anti-gay legislation – Bill Clinton signed a federal version of these laws in 1993. Sadly, lobbying is a ridiculously solid investment and a surefire way to get shit done. Money spent on lobbying has been shown to have a return on investment of up to 22,000%. The National Rifle Association can stop gun control reforms, no matter how much the public wants them, simply by lobbying Congress. Similarly, congressional support for Israel, private prisons and the defense industry will always be staunch, as long as those causes’ lobbies make hobbies of buying bipartisan backing. It’s a good start for Cook to come out and write about discrimination in Indiana, but two op-eds sure as hell ain’t enough from someone that filthy rich (who is already planning to give away his wealth anyway). Nor is firing Apple’s anti-gay Alabama lobbyist. And it’s not enough for Apple or Walmart – headquartered in increasingly anti-gay Arkansas, and the largest private employer in the nation – to speak out after these bills pass. They need to use their ample lobbying muscle to keep them from ever becoming law in the first place.  Lobbying is no less nefarious than tying civil LGBT rights to a corporate equality index. And even if lobbying subverts the intent of our democracy, LGBT discrimination laws do not reflect that democracy in the slightest. For example, an overwhelming percent of the public has supported gay and lesbian job protections for years and yet LGBT Americans do not have employment protections under federal law nor in most states.  So why not make Gay Inc just buy off Congress, too? It’s not thought of as a traditionally historic model of seeking civil rights but, without effective lobbying at the state level, the potential gains of the passage of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (both of which saw lobbyists work their magic on lawmakers) were stymied by state level backlashes and the national Republican southern strategy.  We are witnessing a similar state backlash to federal legislative and judicial gains against LGBT discrimination; the blowback may be intense, given Republicans now control 70% of all statehouses. But gay Americans today have a weapon at mitigating these backlashes my black ancestors didn’t in the 1960s: we have members of our tribe who wield lots of economic and formal political power. The most valued company on earth is headed by a gay man. David Geffen and Peter Thiel are among the richest men in the world. If not exactly overwhelmed by out legislators, Capitol Hill is awash with gay staffers. And of all of his backers, President Obama has perhaps done the most for his LGBT supporters.  It’s still not enough, though. So Apple, Walmart, Gay Inc, and every corporation which pimps out its name at Gay Pride ought to put its economic and political leverage towards lobbying for our common good. Apple spent $3m lobbying last year in just Washington for its own enrichment. And, while a corporation like Walmart may say it can’t spend shareholder money to lobby for human rights, it finds the money to pay the likes of the regressive American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec) to push for legislation it sees as beneficial.  Gay Inc already informally acts as a lobbying clearinghouse for dubious interests which having nothing to do with being queer, like drone manufacturing and financial services. And look no further than its boards of directors and corporate sponsors to understand how tightly Gay Inc already is in bed with banks; financial companies are the most serious lobbyists of all. If power gay philanthropists could get their finance employers to spend even a fraction of what they spend on financial deregulation lobbying legislators directly for gay rights – say, if while HRC is kissing up to Citibank, it could convince the company already shaking Congress down for tax cuts to shake it down for full, real LGBT civil rights too – we’d have equality quicker than a Grindr hookup leaves after he’s finished (and faster than it takes to say those sexy words, “Repeal Dodd-Frank”!) Boycotts are important, and there are many good signs that threatening and enacting them have seemingly had a positive effect in Indiana and may in some other, but not all, states – and you can’t boycott 20 states. You have to change laws at the federal level and in multiple states separately; and, the fastest way is by lobbying, via facetime with and infusions of campaign cash to state legislators. No more dicking around: Tim Cook, other power gays and the companies who want our business need to put their money where their mouths are.",2015-03-31T17:02:05Z,"To combat anti-LGBT laws, companies should pay lobbyists — not lip service","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""49041c05a57419331f0a7795a34295f026726a03""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/31/1427820340671/0f8756d3-b43a-4bd1-9c65-01366daacdbd-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""tim cook saviour"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Companies need to pay more than lip service to LGBT rights.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",30,CEOs like Tim Cook and companies that say they oppose pro-discrimination laws can do more than talk about it.

"Fundraiser bake sales for the homeless are allowed at Andrews University – as long as the homeless aren’t LGBT kids. A planned bake sale had to be abruptly cancelled last week, after student members of the unofficial LGBT group, AULL4One, were told they couldn’t raise money on campus for a Chicago-based homeless organization, Project Fierce, because the western Michigan university felt the charity didn’t align with its mission. “Andrews University recognizes the special challenges facing LGBT youth and believes that efforts to help them are worthy”, the university said in a statement released on March 10. “[But only those] whose mission and practices do not conflict with those of the University”, referring to the LGBT grassroots organization. Their “mission” suggests they would help LGBT homeless organizations, as long as they don’t “advocate behaviors contrary to Adventist beliefs”. (Read: actual acceptance of the youth being LGBT.) When I asked Stephen Payne, the vice-president of integrated marketing and communication at the university, how they can refuse to help LGBT homeless youth – many of whom are homeless due to rejections caused by religion – despite finding them “worthy” of support, he did not answer. Instead, he blamed the students who decided to plan the event without permission from university for the stand-off. Dori Moore, a junior at AU and one of the students who organized the bake sale, told me: “The problem is that Project Fierce is an affirming organization that doesn’t say anything to the effect of ‘we don’t condone practicing homosexuality’.” Outside western Michigan, the cancelled bake sale is just one of countless examples of when Christianity doesn’t work to help the most oppressed groups – continuing to spread beliefs that directly harm LGBT people here in the US. From their battle against marriage equality to their insistence on offering discredited conversion therapies – in which churches try to make people LGBT people straight – the Religious Right has stayed fixed on blocking LGBT equality. After speaking with AU students and staff, I spoke with Abigail Muldoon, a graduate student at DePaul University, the largest Catholic University in the US, about the bake sale and her research to better understand why Christians are so bent on hurting certain minority groups. “It’s ‘Divine Discrimination’,” she told me, a term she uses to discuss the phenomenon of using Christian beliefs to justify minority harassment. “Discrimination justified by Christian beliefs may be particularly harmful, as faith carries powerful weight ... how do you argue with someone who believes they are doing God’s work when hurting the LGBT population?”  But for how long will they be in a position to discriminate? New data from the American Values Atlas show that, for the first time in history, only 47% of people in the US identify as Protestants – and that number is falling. Conservative Christians are becoming a minority, just like the LGBT community. But even if conservative Christians don’t disappear entirely, that doesn’t mean discrimination will be here to stay. Moore has hope in religion and LGBT people: “I think that LGBTQ rights and Christianity could align beautifully” she said, adding: “Unfortunately, Christianity and the Seventh-Day Adventist Church don’t always reflect this origin.” Muldoon, who is a devoted Christian, echoes Moore’s view that LGBTQ community and Christians need not necessarily be at odds. She made sure to mention that without a doubt: “There is no way Jesus would have stopped that bake sale.” “He would have been the first one in line.”",2015-03-17T12:09:39Z,"Christian charities preach helping the less fortunate, unless you're gay","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""36283c9e7d43fc63daa3c5f0113fed2267bd51ff""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/17/1426594077238/ee998894-b50e-40b3-ac0a-2540518a3b1c-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""cupcakes yum"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Why in God’s name would you want to keep LGBT folks out of your bake sale?</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Food and Drink/Food and Drink/REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>",31,Using Christian beliefs to justify discrimination is a problem that goes far beyond one canceled bake sale,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/17/1426594077503/ee998894-b50e-40b3-ac0a-2540518a3b1c-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/17/christian-charities-shut-down-lgbt-bake-sales,4
"Peter Dickson’s dream of establishing Australia’s first LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) residential village in country Victoria came from a deeply personal motivation. “At a dinner party 28 years ago we talked about what we were going to do when we get old. We talked about being surrounded by friends and not being alone and isolated and forgotten about,” he says.That dream is becoming a reality, with 10 contracts signed and hundreds more expressions of interest flooding in for Linton Estate, being marketed to the LGBT community as “a place to truly be you”.  The village is a short stroll from the centre of Ballan, a small town about an hour out of Melbourne between Ballarat and Geelong, and just 20 minutes’ drive from the popular gay destinations of Daylesford and Bacchus Marsh. Dickson says Ballan is the ideal place for such a development because it has a modern hospital, rail access to Melbourne, a meals on wheels service and an appealing local shopping strip. The town has the quaint feel of a sleepy bohemian retreat with a sprinkle of cosmopolitan cafe culture and a number of op shops dotted along the main street.  Linton Estate is being marketed to the LGBT community, but it will be open to all. Dickson compares it to religious retirement villages that are run by the Catholic church, but welcome non-Catholics as residents. Dickson says it will have more the feel of a retirement community, with fewer restrictions than a standard retirement village. It is part of a growing international trend of gay people wanting to find a friendly community in which to grow old – other LGBT retirement homes have recently opened overseas, including Triangle Square in LA and Regnbågen block in Stockholm. A new LGBT aged care centre is in the pipeline in the popular gay district of Prahran in Melbourne, developed by Lifeview Residential Care with the support of the Prahran City Council.  Chris Straw, a Melbourne architect specialising in accommodation for older communities, says he views the movement as a subset of a broader trend of niche centres aimed at bringing together likeminded people in their older years. “We are increasingly finding that globally a lot of the boutique facilities have a compelling story attached to them,” he says, citing an aged care home in Melbourne that caters specifically for the arts community.  Linton Estate will offer six-star resort facilities including a gym, 32-metre pool, wet and dry sauna, bar, restaurant and library. It has a focus on environmental sustainability, with solar street lighting and grey water systems. Prices start at about $400,000, although Dickson hopes to add a one-bedroom option at about $300,000.  Research from the Stonewall Foundation in the UK suggests elderly gay and lesbian people are almost twice as likely as their heterosexual peers to expect to rely on medical, housing, care and home help services. However, they often struggle to find providers who will understand their needs.  The gay rights activist and academic Rodney Croome says such facilities can help quell the prejudice faced by aging members of the LGBT community.  “For some LGBTI people a specific aged care facility is the solution to the prejudice that can still be found in the aged care sector,” he says. “But for the vast majority of LGBT seniors – those who want to live near family and longtime friends – the solution is better policies and more awareness training in existing facilities.” While acknowledging not everyone will be able to afford to live at Linton Estate, Dickson says he thinks such developments will help stem the invisibility often felt by an older generation of LGBT people.  “They were born in the closet and come out of the closet and then go back into the closet due to fear of being picked on and isolation from each other. People that are not under the GLBTI community don’t actually know how discrimination happens to people or how much they are made uncomfortable. Places where they can’t hold hands or embrace or care for each other or dress without comment.”  Ballan local Elizabeth Ivchenko says that while there has been some opposition from a small group of religious people in the area, the town has generally embraced the arrival of Linton Estate.  “The town is growing very fast with lots of young people with modern outlooks to life who are more accepting. It will bring money into the town, and all people bring their own qualities with them. The village will help put Ballan on the map, and will create jobs, and for a small town this is essential.”",2015-04-24T02:13:35Z,Retirement homes for the LGBT community go from dream to reality,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""289bf3cbb0a84fcfeb724c285149a61893924630""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/24/1429840954582/4efcfb50-9ebc-4fbd-ac51-696899ccc1ba-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Linton Estate, near Ballan."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Linton Estate, near Ballan.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: James Norman/The Guardian.</span> </figcaption> </figure>",32,Property developers in Victoria cater to an aging LGBT community who want to grow old among friends<br>,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/24/1429840954932/368cf5ff-b89b-462c-90b0-bc8d377d24dd-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/apr/24/retirement-homes-for-the-lgbt-community-go-from-dream-to-reality,3
"As turning points go, it was a good one. A young Labour MP claimed the scalp of a senior Tory cabinet minister; the look of surprise and excitement on his face mirrored the mood of the country. After 18 years of Conservative government, everything was to be turned on its head. But that night in Enfield in 1997 was symbolic of more than just the first Labour landslide in a generation. Stephen Twigg was gay – a “practising homosexual”, to use a formula still popular at the time – and though rumours about Michael Portillo’s sexuality had been swirling for years, he was most definitely not. In fact, Portillo was the opposite: a buttoned-up member of a ruling class for whom discretion had long been the rule. His slaying felt like a cultural watershed.   Related: Double lives – a history of sex and secrecy at Westminster    Habits built up over decades, the instinctive default to repression, quickly began to melt away. The day after Twigg’s victory, Chris Smith, an MP since 1983 and out since 1984, became the first openly gay secretary of state – culture, naturally. Later that year, Angela Eagle came out: the first openly lesbian MP since Maureen Colquhoun, who had been deselected in the 1970s. The years rolled by and anti-gay legislation was rolled back. The despised section 28 was ditched, and civil partnerships then equal marriage made it on to the statute books. Now Britain finds itself with the queerest legislature in the world: 32 of the United Kingdom’s 650 MPs calling themselves gay, lesbian or bisexual. At 4.9%, this pretty closely reflects what researchers believe to be the sexuality of the population as a whole: an impressive achievement, still to be matched in matters of gender or ethnicity. So who are the LGB MPs (the T, for transgender, is still missing, none of the four candidates who stood this election won their seat)? Twelve are Conservative, 13 Labour, the rest Scottish Nationalists. Among them are veterans such as Eagle, Chris Bryant, Alan Duncan and Crispin Blunt. Newcomers include former NUS president Wes Streeting, who follows in the footsteps of Twigg, also an NUS man. Overall, on 7 May, there were 155 out LGBT candidates. And in two constituencies last week – Lancaster &amp; Fleetwood and Milton Keynes South – both the Tory and Labour candidates were gay, lesbian or bisexual. At the end of the last parliament, the Conservatives had the most LGB MPs, ceding that position to Labour this time around. Proportionally, though, the SNP is now by far the gayest party in Westminster, with 12% of its MPs chalking themselves up as sexual minorities.   Related: Scotland tops league for gay rights    We may scratch our heads as to the meaning of these numbers: is it a surprise that there are so many out Tories? What is it about the SNP? But there’s a bigger question: how did we get here? How did a country raised on tabloid scandal end up so at ease with gay public figures? Homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales in 1967 by reforming home secretary Roy Jenkins (Scotland had to wait until 1980, and Northern Ireland until 1982), but prosecutions for sexual offences continued to snare many gay men into the 90s. In addition, a vicious press culture of blackmail and exposure made life difficult for gay people who wanted to participate in government and politics. Peter Tatchell, who stood as the Labour candidate for Bermondsey in 1983, was the subject of a notoriously homophobic campaign by his Liberal opponents. He remembers the 80s as “the heyday of tabloid fabrications and smears. It was impossible for any candidate or MP to be openly gay without the fear of being demonised by the tabloids.” That didn’t mean parliament was any less lavender-hued than it is today, however. “There were lots of gay MPs,” he says, “but they were all in the closet, either because they were insecure about their own sexuality, or because they feared vilification in the papers and deselection by their party.” So it wasn’t just the press, but the party machines that failed to treat gay and lesbian people with respect, cowed by Fleet Street’s ferocity. “When Maureen Colquhoun was outed in the late 70s, she got a very frosty reception from the Labour party and ended up being deselected,” he says. And things weren’t much easier for him even after he had managed to win the selection for Bermondsey. “I was pressured by the local and national Labour party to not discuss my support for LGBT rights and my sexuality. I insisted on being open on the doorsteps and at public meetings when the issue was raised. Hence the backlash. Constituents and rival parties said: ‘Not only is he gay and wants gay rights, he’s open and brazen about it.’”     Peter Tatchell (in red shirt) joins the celebrations after MPs voted to cut the homosexual age of consent to 16 in 1998. Photograph: Tony Harris/PA    Still, Tatchell says there was “public revulsion” against the homophobia he experienced, which he believes made the tabloids more reluctant to conduct anti-gay witch-hunts, for a time, at least. As a result, Chris Smith had an easier ride when he came out in 1984. The Conservatives’ relationship with homosexuality was equally uneasy. The writer and former Tory MP Matthew Parris has recalled a meeting with his boss Margaret Thatcher. “I told her I was gay when I went to say goodbye to her and she put an arm on my wrist and said: ‘Matthew, that must have been very difficult for you to say.’” Gay MPs were tolerated, so long as discretion ruled. The mid-90s, however, saw Conservatives among those leading a battle for equal rights. It was Edwina Currie who tabled an amendment to bring the age of consent for gay men down from 21 to 16 – there was famously no such law dealing specifically with lesbianism. Her amendment was defeated, but another one to bring the age down to 18 was supported by the prime minister, John Major, and home secretary Michael Howard. “Major issued guidance saying it was OK for senior civil servants to be gay and that changed the atmosphere a bit,” says former Labour spin doctor Lance Price. “He met Ian McKellen at Downing Street and so on and, by the time Labour were in power, it was clear that society had changed dramatically.” If society had changed, the press still had a way to catch up. Price recalls: “When I worked for Blair, we had the Sun rampaging around asking if we were being run by a Gay Mafia.” But it backfired, gaining little traction among readers. David Yelland, the editor at the time, has since said how much he regrets the story. Blair, who once famously asked Price, “When you see a beautiful woman, doesn’t it do anything for you?”, was laidback about his gay MPs. “When the tabloids tried to get up various scandals about ministers, [he] took the view that ‘I will treat everyone equally in this. If it was a so called-scandal involving a man or a woman or two men, then that’s all the same to me.’”     Angela Eagle: deciding to be open about her sexuality ‘wasn’t easy’. Photograph: Felix Clay for the Guardian    Eagle, who came out in September 1997, says that, despite support from “Tony Blair down, and particularly from my local party”, deciding to be open about her sexuality “wasn’t easy. There was only one woman before me – Maureen Colquhoun. She had been outed by Nigel Dempster at the Daily Mail in very nasty circumstances, to mass ridicule. It wasn’t exactly a great precedent. But I had decided to move in with my partner and I was ready to do it. It does free you up to be yourself. I think, in politics, you have to be yourself. It just makes you a better politician.” Eagle then found herself burdened, to an extent, by her status as a pioneer. “The media think it’s the only thing about you. I was happy to talk about it, but not ad infinitum. We have a pile of views on a load of other things. The only thing the media wanted to know about was who else was gay and I didn’t think that was very fair.” Still, she is grateful to be seen as a role model, and “quietly proud” of having blazed a trail for others.   Related: As Labour’s first transgender candidate, I know it is the party of equality | Emily Brothers    What is clear is that the very presence of LGB MPs can have profound effects on people far beyond parliament. Trans activist and writer Paris Lees says: “I kind of hate to say this, but it’s really important to have validation by the state. It was a huge deal for me just to get a British passport that said I was female. And, also, finding out that Christine Burns had got an MBE for her work on gender, just knowing that she had been honoured by the Queen. Where I came from, I just felt like I was a freak, something to be ashamed of, so to have people who are different actually respected in public life – to have them actually voted in – is really important.” Lees is disappointed that there are still no British trans MPs and frustrated that Labour candidate Emily Brothers, who announced she is transgender before the election, failed to win. But she thinks future candidates won’t have mountains to climb. “When people meet you, you’re not a transgender person, you’re a person,” she says. “If it were me going round on doorsteps, I think they’d like me. Once somebody’s met someone who is transgender, they realise it’s not such a big deal.”     Crispin Blunt, the Tory MP who had a battle with his local party over his sexuality. Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA    Gay MPs don’t necessarily mean gay rights. Tatchell remembers that “in the 80s, a lot of gay MPs voted against equality, and many straight ones – Gavin Strang, Jeremy Corbyn, Dawn Primarolo – voted in favour. I’ve always prioritised getting MPs who are supportive of LGBT rights, regardless of their sexuality.” And there’s no reason to imagine that the era of the closet-case is definitively over. Constituency parties can still balk at the idea of a gay MP. Crispin Blunt faced deselection as recently 2013 after having spoken about his sexuality (he eventually won a postal ballot of party members). Despite this, some will undoubtedly have the courage to come out during the course of this parliament. Others may decide to keep the secret for their entire careers. With the battle for legislation more or less won, is the good news about representation in the Commons mere icing on the cake? Now gay couples are able to marry and are protected from discrimination, is parliament still the key battleground it once was? Gay rights group Stonewall’s current focus is on bullying, which suggests that attitudes, rather than legal obstacles, are the final frontier of LGBT rights. Its research shows that 55% of gay young people experience homophobic bullying. How will the new phalanx of gay and lesbian MPs change that? Maybe just being there helps. “It really matters that parliament reflects the population,” says Eagle. But she, like Tatchell, sounds a note of caution. “I won’t say how progressive this parliament is on LGBT rights until it’s met and we see what it does.” Given that Cameron has just appointed Caroline Dinenage, who voted against gay marriage, as minister for equalities, it seems wise to be vigilant. “It’s a good thing that we’ve made progress,” says Eagle. “It’s important we never take that progress for granted.” • This article was amended on 15 May 2015.

"Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook has called on US legislators to rethink their support of so-called religious freedom laws, which enshrine the ability of individuals to breach nondiscrimination laws if the laws go against personal religious beliefs. Such laws have been passed in 20 US states, most recently Indiana, and are widely seen to be specifically aimed at enabling discrimination against LGBT people. Cook, who spoke publicly for the first time about being gay in October, writes that the laws, as well as more explicitly discriminatory bills elsewhere, “rationalize injustice by pretending to defend something many of us hold dear”. In an editorial in the Washington Post, he continues that “They go against the very principles our nation was founded on, and they have the potential to undo decades of progress toward greater equality. “America’s business community recognised a long time ago that discrimination, in all its forms, is bad for business. At Apple, we are in business to empower and enrich our customers’ lives. We strive to do business in a way that is just and fair. That’s why, on behalf of Apple, I’m standing up to oppose this new wave of legislation – wherever it emerges.” Under Cook, who became chief executive of the firm in 2011, Apple has become a far more active campaigner on social issues. Shortly after becoming leader, Cook instituted the company’s first charitable gift-matching programme (Famously, Steve Jobs, the company’s co-founder and chief executive from 1996 until his death in 2011, had given the company’s charitable efforts a low priority), while the company launched an advert supporting Pride last July. In a Bloomberg Businessweek article, in which he discussed his sexuality for the first time, Cook expressed his pride at Apple’s record. “We’ve taken a strong stand in support of a workplace equality bill before Congress, just as we stood for marriage equality in our home state of California. And we spoke up in Arizona when that state’s legislature passed a discriminatory bill targeting the gay community,” a similar bill to the one recently passed in Indiana. In the Washington Post editorial, Cook says that the company’s message, “to people around the country and around the world, is this: Apple is open. Open to everyone, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, how they worship or who they love. Regardless of what the law might allow in Indiana or Arkansas, we will never tolerate discrimination.” “This isn’t a political issue,” he concluded. “It isn’t a religious issue. This is about how we treat each other as human beings. Opposing discrimination takes courage. With the lives and dignity of so many people at stake, it’s time for all of us to be courageous.”",2015-03-30T09:46:02Z,Apple's Tim Cook calls out 'religious freedom' laws as discriminatory,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""40051cbf00f5c81b7855a21dadbc4a6cb80d3366""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/30/1427707575798/fe9035d7-da91-4521-9bbc-7efe75411001-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Tim Cook speaks at the launch of the new MacBook in March 2015."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Tim Cook speaks at the launch of the new MacBook in March 2015.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Eric Risberg/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>",34,"US laws enabling discrimination against LGBT people ‘rationalize injustice by pretending to defend something many of us hold dear’, says Apple chief",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/30/1427707576169/fe9035d7-da91-4521-9bbc-7efe75411001-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/30/apple-tim-cook-religious-freedom-laws-discriminatory-lgbt,7
"  Related: Arkansas and Indiana approve redrafted religious freedom bills after backlash    The outskirts offer no hint that this is one of the most gay-friendly small towns in America. “End Times are here. Where will you spend eternity?” asks a roadside sign, just before a right turn that leads to a Christian outlet store and a 67ft statue of Jesus Christ. The national headquarters of a Ku Klux Klan group is 50 miles away. But Eureka Springs, a pretty Victorian spa town of 2,000 nestled in the Ozark mountains, has for decades promoted an atmosphere of tolerance and inclusiveness that has made it a haven for the LGBT community. When Arkansas politicians introduced an act banning local anti-discrimination laws, tiny Eureka defied the state legislature and took a stand against bigotry by passing a civil rights ordinance that saw long-simmering tensions in the town froth up and spill over. Senate Bill 202, proposed by two lawmakers based an hour’s drive from Eureka, stops Arkansas cities from creating ordinances that outlaw discrimination. It passed in February and becomes law in the summer. Formally known as the “Intrastate Commerce Improvement Act”, it purportedly exists to help businesses by making non-discrimination rules uniform across the state.  But Arkansas does not have a law banning anti-gay discrimination, so the effect of SB202 is to erode the rights of gay people in places such as Eureka that want to protect them.  The state’s LGBT community absorbed another blow on Thursday. Amid a national furore that prompted the original proposals to be revised after critics said they would legally protect anti-gay discrimination, the Republican-dominated Arkansas legislature approved a “religious freedom” bill that does not give specific protections against unfair treatment based on sexual orientation. Also passed in the Arkansas legislature last week: Senate Bill 939, the “Ten Commandments Monument Display Act”, which allows a privately funded display of the edicts to be erected on the state capitol’s grounds.   Related: Huckabee: 'Militant gay community' to blame for backlash against Indiana law    Against this backdrop, Eureka held one of its thrice-annual Diversity festivals this weekend; this year, it happened to coincide with Easter. Christian groups reserved the downtown’s park and bandstand for a Celebrate Jesus concert and parade while shops hung rainbow pennants in their windows and prepared for the traditional Public Display of Affection kissing celebration at noon on Saturday. A mile away, arms outstretched, the Christ of the Ozarks looked impassively down over the town, from the sprawling campus of the Great Passion Play. The giant mortar statue was built in 1967 by Gerald LK Smith, a politician, clergyman and white supremacist who is buried just to Jesus’s left. The monument is one of the highlights of a religious theme park that for six months of the year hosts an epic theatrical re-enactment of the events around Jesus’s crucifixion. More than seven million people have watched a performance since the 4,100-seat amphitheatre opened in 1968, according to organisers. But as Eureka Springs became an increasingly popular gay destination, crowds fell to the extent that in 2012, the Passion Play closed due to lack of funds.  It was resurrected by Randall Christy, an Oklahoma-based Baptist pastor and the founder of a Christian radio network. “Randall Christy told me the attendance at the Great Passion Play is what it is because church groups have decided that they can boycott homosexuality by not coming to Eureka Springs,” said pastor Phil Wilson of First Christian Church, which is on Passion Play Road, a short drive from the theatre.  “There have been many things that have happened in Eureka Springs that have made us be perceived as an eminently desirable homosexual destination,” he said. “We have 6,000 years of Judeo-Christian history that has affirmed that homosexuality is morally wrong and we live in a society that says it’s morally right.” Asked if he truly believed that Christians in the US were under threat of oppression and needed laws to protect them, he referenced the Islamist terror attack that killed 147 people in Kenya on Thursday.  “It’s on Fox News continually in the last day or two,” he said. “I see persecutions.” ‘A handful of homosexual activists’         They’re Coming to Your Town: ‘Learn how to fight a well-organised gay agenda.’    Wilson was one of the stars of They’re Coming To Your Town, a teaching DVD produced by a fundamentalist Christian group, the American Family Association, which offers “a look at how a handful of homosexual activists infiltrated the Eureka Springs, Arkansas, government and changed the very moral fibre of the city”. In 2007, he mobilised support for a failed attempt to fight an ordinance giving the city the right to create a domestic partnership registry that allows non-heterosexual couples to make their relationships a matter of public record. Currently, he is worried about toilets.  “Any person can have unlimited access to any private areas of our city – that is, a man can enter a women’s bathroom by saying ‘I am a transsexual’,” he said. “Presumably I could perceive myself to be a female on Tuesday and Thursday and a male on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.” Wilson is at the forefront of the backlash against Ordinance 2223, a non-discrimination measure passed unanimously by the Eureka Springs city council in February as a riposte to Senate Bill 202. Among its equality provisions is the prohibition of unfair treatment based on “gender identity” and “gender expression”, which Wilson fears will make Eureka Springs a cross-dressing, restroom-lurking sexual predator’s paradise. Opponents gathered petition signatures and successfully pressured the city into holding a special election on the issue on 12 May. Though the ordinance seems likely to be upheld given Eureka’s large proportion of gay residents, last December an equal rights ordinance was repealed in nearby Fayetteville. Josh Clark, 35, is co-owner of the Green Gourd, a gift shop in the town centre which has a large rainbow flag fluttering outside. He moved to Eureka with his partner from Jonesboro, near Memphis, in search of more gay-friendly surroundings.  “Some Christians here feel that this town has gone straight to hell,” he said. “[So-called religious freedom bills are] a concerted effort to enshrine discrimination within the law; that’s what we’re dealing with here. Our lives are in the middle of this.”     ‘We need to talk in terms of Christian extremists,’ says Eureka Springs alderman Bob Thomas, of opponents of the town’s tolerant attitude. ‘There are a lot of good Christians.’ Photograph: Tom Dart    But he believes that highly conservative Christians are such a small minority among residents within the city limits that their views have little impact and will not ruin the all-inclusive, all-equal ethos of Eureka Springs.  “One of the things that’s unique about Eureka is that since we’re such a tourist destination we pull in people from across the country and across the world,” he said. “We have a very sophisticated culture here, one of art and vibrancy, and so you do tend to get a more liberal, a more educated view coming from the population.” “When you talk about the people that are opposed to the ordinance we need to be talking in terms of Christian extremists,” said Bob Thomas, one of the aldermen who voted for 2223. “There are a lot of good Christians.” Thomas was wearing a Hawaiian shirt and sitting in Aquarius, a taqueria that, like many other businesses here, prominently displays a pro-ordinance poster.  “They’ve kicked the [gay-sympathising] Methodists out of their parade. That’s pretty extreme if you’re having a Jesus weekend. I don’t think they’re oppressed anywhere. What they want is the freedom to oppress other people.” ‘We’re the most diverse community in all of Arkansas’         Shop owner Josh Clark on gay-friendly downtown Eureka Springs.    From the beer garden of the Eureka Live Underground bar, Carly James, who said she worked as a “barista-auctioneer”, expressed concern that perceptions of Arkansas as gay-hostile in the wake of the religious freedom bill would harm Eureka’s reputation. “I think we’re the most diverse community in all of Arkansas and it’s really upsetting that we have to be part of what the state’s doing,” the 39-year-old said. “That’s why we all live here – because we don’t feel that way.”  The first same-sex marriage license in Arkansas was issued in Eureka Springs last May, before the state supreme court put the practice on hold. The bar’s co-owner, Walter Burrell, said he was “ashamed” of the politicians.  “It’s not Arkansas values and it’s certainly not Eureka Springs values,” he said. “Before all this, nobody cared if you handled snakes as long as you didn’t hand one to them.” Bob Thomas said that one motivation behind the rapid introduction of the ordinance in February was to get it on the books before the statewide law took effect, in the hope it will boost the city’s case if, as seems possible, the question of whether it can be enforced ends up in court. The 68-year-old former teacher adopted two sons as a gay single parent living in Alaska, where he said that in some ways the lower level of political interference made it easier to be gay.  “Arkansas was sort of a ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ state,” he said. Now, he said, “down here people are not that willing to let their neighbours live their own lives.”",2015-04-05T15:10:47Z,"Welcome to Eureka Springs, Arkansas: a 'desirable homosexual destination'","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""d45a85e9bf1433bb2c019a2c49d626ba4662e63f""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/5/1428243313787/a566f88a-7747-4d3c-8af0-53fd1c2718bf-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Christ of the Ozarks"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The Christ of the Ozarks in Eureka Springs, Arkansas presides over the Great Passion Play.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Tom Dart</span> </figcaption> </figure>",35,"Amidst national controversy over laws that outlaw or encourage discrimination, one southern town is seen by all sides as a haven for tolerance of LGBT people",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/5/1428243314047/f7d50c8d-36a9-4d92-8486-d839166b9e7e-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/05/arkansas-religious-gay-discrimination-eureka-springs,7
"A Northern Ireland bakery has been found guilty in a landmark ruling of discrimination for refusing to bake a cake with a pro-gay marriage theme.  Ashers Baking Company received worldwide support from evangelical and born-again Christians over its refusal to make the cake for a local gay rights activist in the region.   Related: What is Belfast's 'gay cake' case?    But a judge in Belfast high court on Tuesday ruled that the family-owned firm was guilty of discriminating against Gareth Lee on the grounds of sexual orientation.  District judge Isobel Brownlie acknowledged that the McArthur family, which owns Ashers, do “hold genuine deeply-held religious beliefs”. However, she pointed out that government regulations were there “to protect people from having their sexual orientation used for having their business turned down”. The judge added: “I believe the defendants did have the knowledge that the plaintiff was gay.” Outlining her reasons why this was a case of discrimination, Brownlie said: “The defendants are not a religious organisation. They conduct a business for profit. As much as I acknowledge their religious beliefs, this is a business to provide service to all. The law says they must do that.”  Ashers was ordered to pay agreed damages of £500 plus court costs. The firm was accused of discriminating on the grounds of sexual orientation against Lee, a volunteer with gay rights campaign group QueerSpace.  Lee asked Ashers in Belfast’s Royal Avenue to bake the cake last year to mark the election of the first openly gay mayor in Northern Ireland, Andrew Muir.  Lee reported the bakery to the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland after it reversed an earlier agreement to bake the cake with the pro-gay marriage message.  During the three-day court hearing in March, Lee said the decision by Ashers decision to hand back the £36.50 he had originally paid for the cake “made me feel I’m not worthy, a lesser person and to me that was wrong”.  However, Lee, through the Belfast-based gay rights lobby group, the Rainbow Project, said he would not be making any statement in relation to the judgment.  Ashers’ general manager, Daniel McArthur, said the family were extremely disappointed with the judgment. Denying they had discriminated against Lee, McArthur said: “We’ve said from the start that our issue was with the message on the cake, not the customer and we didn’t know what the sexual orientation of Mr Lee was, and it wasn’t relevant either. We’ve always been happy to serve any customers that come into our shops. “The ruling suggests that all business owners will have to be willing to promote any cause or campaign no matter how much they disagree with it. Or as the Equality Commission has suggested, they should perhaps just close down, and that can’t be right.  “But we won’t be closing down, we certainly don’t think we’ve done anything wrong and we will be taking legal advice to consider our options for appeal.” Responding to the guilty verdict, Northern Ireland’s deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, tweeted: “Asher’s bakery judgment a good result for equality, Gay people have for far too long been discriminated against. We and the law on their side.” McGuinness has suggested that a referendum specific to Northern Ireland be held asking the public to vote for or against gay marriage. However, Democratic Unionist party member David McIlveen also reacted on Twitter. McIlveen wrote: “Utterly sickened that a Christian-owned business has been hauled over the coals for refusing to promote something that is not legal in Northern Ireland.” Meanwhile, the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice leader, Jim Allister, said it was “a dark day for justice and religious freedom in Northern Ireland”.  One of the main gay rights organisations in Northern Ireland, the Rainbow Project, welcomed the verdict. John O’Doherty, its director, said the judge “clearly articulated that this is direct discrimination for which there can be no justification”. LGBT and human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell has backed the legal action by Gareth Lee against the bakery. He said: “Ashers is a business serving the public, not a religious organisation. It has a legal duty to provide its services without discrimination.  “The owners cannot legitimately claim they should be above the law. If they had won this case, it would have driven a coach and horses through the equality laws; creating a legal precedent and opening the door for other people to claim the right to discriminate on religious and other grounds. It would have led to a situation where anyone could claim the right to discriminate on the basis that they disagreed with another person’s beliefs.” ",2015-05-19T11:15:03Z,Northern Ireland bakers guilty of discrimination over gay marriage cake,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""b9cff83d5d2f6c947c24d385b137c261f5f1f7da""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/b9cff83d5d2f6c947c24d385b137c261f5f1f7da/0_0_4288_2577/1000.jpg"" alt=""Ashers Baking Company.

"Designers Domenico Gabbana and Stefano Dolce have hit back back in a row with Elton John, who called for a boycott of their fashion house after they expressed opposition to gay couples having children. The pair released statements on Sunday insisting they were not seeking to judge families that did not have a mother and father. Dolce said that, while his own family was “traditional”, that did not “imply that I don’t understand different ones”. He said: “I was talking about my personal view, without judging other people’s choices and decisions.” Gabbana said: “We talked about our way of seeing reality, but it was never our intention to judge other people’s choices. We do believe in freedom and love.” Earlier, John and leading gay rights groups had called for the boycott as designers’ comments about fertility treatment were labelled “archaic” and “deeply insulting”. People born through IVF were referred to as “synthetic children” and Gabbana referred to “wombs for rent”. John, who has had two children with his husband David Furnish through IVF, said the remarks, which were made in an interview last week, were “out of step with the times”.  Speaking to the Italian magazine Panorama alongside his business partner, Stefano Gabbana, the designer said children should be born to a mother and a father. “I’m not convinced by those I call the children of chemicals, synthetic children,” he added. “Wombs for rent, sperm chosen from a catalogue ... psychiatrists are not ready to confront the effects of this experimentation,” he said. Dolce, who spent more than 20 years in a relationship with Gabbana, went on to say he could not have a child because he was gay. Speaking on Sunday, Gabbana said: “We firmly believe in democracy and the fundamental principle of freedom of expression that upholds it.” And his business partner said: “I’m Sicilian and I grew up in a traditional family, made up of a mother, a father and children. I am very well aware of the fact that there are other types of families and they are as legitimate as the one I’ve known.  “But in my personal experience, family had a different configuration. That is the place where I learnt the values of love and family.” John became a parent, along with Furnish, in 2010 and 2013 through the use of a surrogate mother in the US.  Reacting to their interview comments, he wrote on Instagram: “How dare you refer to my beautiful children as ‘synthetic’... And shame on you for wagging your judgemental little fingers at IVF – a miracle that has allowed legions of loving people, both straight and gay, to fulfil their dream of having children.” He ended his note with the campaign hashtag #BoycottDolceGabbana. Gay rights activist Peter Tatchell said he was also supporting a D&amp;G boycott. He told the Guardian: “It’s quite outrageous that two gay fashion designers who have relied on the gay community for much of their success are opposing gay equality. They’re lining up with the Pope and the far right in their support for legal discrimination.” He added: “If they don’t want to be parents that’s fine, but it’s deeply insulting to disparage the many same sex parents who have brought up children happily and successfully.” Ruth Hunt, the chief executive of the LGBT equality group Stonewall, added: “We strongly dispute the comments made by Dolce and Gabbana. Being a good parent has nothing to do with sexual orientation or whether a child has two mums or two dads. The important thing is a loving family, whatever its make up.” While the two D&amp;G designers have been collectively criticised for the comments, Gabbana told Panorama he was open to becoming a father and has since said the suggestion he is against gay adoption is wrong. “A question is followed by an answer. Respect comes from accepting different views!” Gabbana wrote on Instagram. The magazine interview has also been criticised in Italy, where the president of LGBT rights organisation Arcigay, Flavio Romani, said the two designers should not push their views on others. “Their position is absolutely personal and it contradicts the global movement for adoption and gay rights. Gay people have the right to be considered equal to others, in bringing up a child,” he told the Guardian.   Related: Dolce &amp; Gabbana celebrates motherhood at Milan fashion week    While same-sex partnerships and adoption are yet to be legalised in Italy, Romani said other people’s access to such rights should not be opposed on principle. “If there was gay marriage, they’re not obliged to get married. If adoption was possible, they’re not obliged to adopt. There must be an option to make a choice,” he said. Dolce did however win support in Italy from Federica Chiavaroli, a senator from the New Centre-Right (NCD) party. “I’m with @dolcegabbana...Long live the family with a mother and a father,” she wrote on Twitter.    Sto con @dolcegabbana e non con @ivanscalfarotto. Viva la famiglia con una mamma e un papà. #matrimoniogay #adozionigay @NCD_tweet @angealfa&mdash; federica chiavaroli (@fedechiavaroli) March 12, 2015    The traditional family model has been at the centre of the latest fashion campaign by D&amp;G, whose new collection is titled “Viva la mamma”. Off the catwalk, an ongoing #DGfamily social media campaign encourages people to publish their family photos online. Dolce said the campaign was aimed at encouraging families to stick together. “We tried to give the idea of the clan, of the strength of the union. My mother always implored me and my brothers to stay united,” he said. But while the tight-knit family has been a staple of Italian branding and advertising for decades, openly excluding same-sex couples has caused controversy.

Guido Barilla initially said people could pick another pasta brand if they didn’t like his views, but issued an apology following the furore. The negative reaction to Barilla reflected the gradual change in public opinion in Italy, where conservative views have made way for more liberal voices. • This article was amended on 19 March 2015.

"I never thought that somebody would consider resigning because of me. Or even that a whole team might resign because of me. I was actually happy to resign myself: after all, I seemed to be the source of the problem. But our manager didn’t want any of us to go. I was working for an NGO in Lebanon and I had recently requested a change in my contract. I was now in a relationship with another woman, and I wanted my partner to accompany me, but a colleague refused to process my partner’s monthly allowance. Our manager, searching for a compromise, was conflicted. On one hand he worried that the other employee would take the NGO to court if she or any of her team members had to make the payment to my partner. But on the other he felt a moral obligation to apply the same values that the NGO promoted to one of their staff members. He did not want to undermine my right to be treated equally.  After three long and painful months full of heated discussions, it was finally agreed that the colleague who complained would issue my partner’s payment every month but that the name of my partner would not appear on the receipt so she would not have to face her team with the shameful news, which was her major concern. In the end no one had to resign. I’m an aid worker. And I’m gay.   Related: You need a friend: why peer support is key to surviving humanitarian work    I was randomly outed by my work colleagues in Ethiopia, a country where homosexuality is illegal and highly homophobic. My international fellow workers would publicly use my sexual orientation as the target of their jokes or disclose it in front of the local staff, behaviour which may have constituted harassment by the law in their home country. In Rwanda, one of the work colleagues I had previously worked with in another mission and knew me well advised me to hide the fact that I was in a romantic relationship with another woman. Since homosexuality is criminalised in Rwanda and rejected by society, my colleague wanted to minimise the risks that I could face. But it meant I had to deny a very important part of my identity, pretend to be someone else, pretend to be straight. Most international NGOs are registered in countries where homosexuality is legal, including same-sex marriage, and socially accepted. NGOs are institutions whose mandates include globally fighting for human rights, equality, protection and social justice. Yet, the rights of LGBTQI NGO staff continue to be neglected, bended or removed all together. Very few NGOs have written policies on same-sex couples. They seem to prefer hiding behind loose policies of non-discrimination so they can adapt their treatment based on the context, the NGO’s safety and reputation or the person interpreting them. Unfortunately, not only do many NGOs allow discrimination based on sexual orientation to happen in their countries of operation, but they even justify discriminatory attitudes with religious and cultural arguments, let alone if there is no supportive legal body in that particular country. Many LGBTQI NGO workers choose to remain invisible for fear of being discriminated against or hindering their employment prospects. Coming out during an interview (e.g. if applying for accompanied status, where you would like your partner to come with you) triggers too many questions about homosexuality in the country where you are planning to go and how you would cope with that. These questions often reveal hidden fears, misconceptions as well as a lack of research and understanding from the NGO side.   Related: Why it's time we talked about the sex lives of humanitarians    Support for LGBTQI individuals and their families while they are deployed abroad is minimal, with only a handful of websites and employee support groups existing out there. Peer support can be hard to come by since most of us keep usually quiet about our sexual orientation while “in the field”. This is why I have recently started a blog, The GAYd Worker, that aims to raise awareness about the rights of LGBTQI staff and to provide a space for aid workers to share their experiences of discrimination and self-censorship, as well as solidarity and support. NGOs should act as a haven for the principles they promote, regardless of where their field offices are based, in order to be coherent with their values and mission. In the last few years, an increasing number of NGOs have prioritised the promotion of gender equality amongst their teams and are conducting trainings and ad hoc events to encourage their local and international staff to become advocates of gender equality whatever the sector they might be working in. A similar process should be adopted to initiate a dispassionate debate on the rights of LGBTQI staff within NGOs, regardless of the legal and social framework they operate in. Meanwhile, all NGOs should draw up inclusive policies where LGBTQI issues are properly addressed, including same-sex marriage and partnership. Some NGOs have attempted to make courageous decisions but they were reversed soon afterwards due to their lack of popularity amongst their supporters and donors, leading to the resignation of one of their board members. NGOs should also train their staff members, both national and international, on equality and diversity to foster cultures of mutual respect and tolerance. Homophobic behaviours should be condemned, and indeed sanctioned, instead of being justified under the freedom of thought umbrella while undermining somebody else’s right to be treated equally.

"  Related: Indiana Republicans to amend 'religious freedom' law in face of backlash    LGBT and civil rights groups are mobilising for a nationwide battle to safeguard the gains of the marriage equality movement, in the face of a gathering backlash that is spreading anti-gay bills across the country. Republican-controlled legislatures have introduced more than 85 anti-gay bills in 28 separate states, according to the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBT-rights advocacy group in the US. New laws targeting gay couples have been passed in Indiana, Arkansas and Mississippi, with many other states attempting to follow suit. On Monday, Apple’s openly gay chief executive, Tim Cook, sounded the alarm about the rash of new laws, which he described as contrary to America’s founding principles of freedom and equality. He likened the anti-gay surge across state assemblies to “whites only” signs in the days of racial segregation.  “We must never return to any semblance of that time,” he said. Eunice Rho, advocacy and policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), said the volume of legislation coming out of state assemblies was “very high and very troubling”. She said the phenomenon was a direct response to the advances made by the LGBT equality movement that now stands on the verge of what is expected to be an historic US supreme court ruling extending constitutional protections to same-sex marriage. “A lot of what we are seeing now is the rewards of our success. We see this for what it is – it is Plan B: an attempt to erode the gains that have been made towards marriage equality and LGBT equality overall,” Rho said. Shannon Minter, legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said civil rights and LGBT groups were working closely together in a concerted effort to block the bills before they ever reach the statute books. Where new laws have been enacted, litigation would be considered, but only as a last resort Minter said. “It’s so much better to stop these discriminatory moves before they become law. Litigation is a very expensive, time-consuming and uncertain way to fight back.” The discriminatory bills have come in a variety of guises. Some like those in Alabama, Florida and Michigan would allow officials to turn away gay and lesbian couples seeking to adopt or foster children. Republicans in other states such as Oklahoma are trying to allow gay conversion groups to flourish by protecting gay-to-straight “therapy” groups from legal action. Florida has gone another route still, focusing its efforts on transgender individuals. But the most common form of the backlash has come in a spate of bills known as Religious Freedom Restoration Acts (RFRA), that seek to claw back some of the ground lost to same-sex marriage by allowing businesses and individuals to refuse services to gay and lesbian couples on grounds of religious conviction. A law of this sort was attempted by Arizona but vetoed by the then governor Jan Brewer last year, following a rebellion by local business leaders. Arkansas is reaching the final stages of a similar “religious freedom” bill. Last week Indiana’s governor Mike Pence signed into law its version of RFRA, prompting a blizzard of largely adverse reaction from activists, business leaders, religious groups, media outlets and sporting leagues. The furor has put Pence on the defensive, forcing him to offer a possible supplementary bill that would “clarify” the purpose of the new law. Minter said that the response had been overwhelming. “I’m feeling very optimistic after what has happened in Indiana,” he said. “There has been a huge public outcry coming from all quarters and that’s a testament to the highly structured network that has been created that can get the word out quickly.” But challenges remain. As Arkansas pushes ahead with its own variation of RFRA, the Republican-held legislature has already passed a law that would leave LGBT people vulnerable to discrimination anywhere in the state. SB 202 prohibits any city, town or county in the state from framing its own local ordinances relating to discrimination. The law does not specifically mention the LGBT community, but given its timing just before the US supreme court hears aural arguments in its review of gay marriage on 28 April, the impetus of the act is widely assumed to be in that direction. SB 202 declares an “emergency” that it says must be addressed in the name of “the public peace, health and safety”. It says that it is “immediately necessary to create uniformity regarding discrimination laws across the state” – which is ironic because Arkansas at state level has no anti-discrimination laws relating to gay people. In effect Arkansas, as well as Tennessee and West Virginia, which are pursuing similar laws, are saying that discrimination against the LGBT community must be allowed to take place in every corner of their territory. Even where bills are defeated, there is no guarantee that they will not return. Republican representatives in Maine tried to pass an RFRA bill last year but were forced to drop the legislation in the face of widespread opposition. Now a coalition of groups in the state is gearing up for what is expected to be a renewed attempt to pass the law. “We anticipate they will make another attempt, and we’ll be ready for it,” said Ben Klein, a senior attorney with Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders in Boston. Klein said he was confident a revived bill would be defeated a second time. “We have very strong arguments that these laws are contrary to the country’s values of individualism and equal protection in front of the law. They are bad for business and have many untold consequences.”",2015-03-31T11:00:05Z,Equality groups ready for counterattack against wave of anti-gay bills across US,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""1f91a6fdce9570b0ccca2b5bff89517360ef70d6""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/1f91a6fdce9570b0ccca2b5bff89517360ef70d6/0_0_3500_2102/1000.jpg"" alt=""Organisers in Indiana"" width=""1000"" height=""601"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Organisers fire up a crowd of demonstrators gathered to protest a controversial ‘religious freedom’ bill recently signed by Indiana’s governor Mike Pence.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Nate Chute/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>",39,LGBT and civil rights mobilising to protect gains of the marriage equality movement as Republican-controlled legislatures have introduced more than 85 anti-gay bills,http://media.guim.co.uk/1f91a6fdce9570b0ccca2b5bff89517360ef70d6/0_0_3500_2102/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/31/lgbt-rights-protect-marriage-equality-anti-gay-bills,7
"The New York City St Patrick’s Day parade is taking a step toward progress by allowing an LGBT group to march openly for the first time in the parade’s 254-year history, but advocates across the city have voiced strong opposition that the inclusion of one such group does not go far enough. On Tuesday, OUT@NBCUniversal, which describes itself as “the employee resource group for LGBT &amp; Straight Ally employees at NBCUniversal”, will march down 5th Avenue with tens of thousands of fellow revelers, bringing an end to a decades-long ban that forbade gay groups from openly participating. However, LGBT advocates across the city argue the decision to allow OUT@NBCUniversal, which has ties to the parade’s broadcaster NBC, is not inclusive enough.    Related: Boston's St Patrick's Day parade to allow two gay and lesbian groups to march    The Irish Queers, a group of activists who have long advocated for the parade to allow LGBT individuals to march openly, said on Sunday that they planned to protest at the parade on Tuesday morning. “The parade continues to marginalize and shame Irish LGBTQ people,” they said in a statement. “We hope that next year’s parade will finally see the end of discrimination — and that corporations and others who say they support inclusion will work with the Irish LGBTQ community, rather than through backroom deals.” They are not alone in their sentiment.     I can&#39;t wait to not march in my parade this Tuesday! @IrishQueers #EndTheLGBTBan&mdash; Mary Emily O&#39;Hara (@MaryEmilyOHara) March 16, 2015    When the organizers’ decision to allow OUT@NBCUniversal to march was first announced last fall, it was met with similar skepticism by several long-time LGBT advocates who saw the arrangement as lacking transparency and exclusionary toward other LGBT groups who had fought for years for the ability to march openly. Those organizations are expected to only be able to apply in future years. On 11 March, NBCUniversal posted an interview segment from Shift on MSNBC that addressed these concerns directly. “It was never our goal, or never the intention that we be the only gay group allowed to march under a banner, nor did we know that we would be,” said executive vice president and chief diversity officer Craig Robinson. Robinson cited NBC’s long relationship with the parade as its broadcaster, as well as the guidance of Frank Comerford, a former marshall of the parade and currently a senior NBC executive, as the key reason OUT@NBCUniversal was able to participate. “We had some access, we had some guidance, and we knew that it took one group...breaking the ban, needed to break that seal,” Robinson said.  Last year, the issue of the LGBT ban came to a head when New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had recently swept into City Hall with a whirlwind progressive campaign, announced that he would boycott the parade until all could march openly regardless of gender or sexuality. The attention around the controversial ban sparked a furor that resulted in major sponsors, including Guinness, withdrawing support from the parade, not to mention mountains of bad press for the organizers. A similar fight that took place over the South Boston St Patrick’s Day parade over an LGBT group’s attempt to march also added significant fuel to the fire, and made the parades’ policies of exclusion a national story in 2014. This year, Boston’s parade allowed two LGBT groups to march for the first time. “With this year’s parade, Boston is putting years of controversy behind us,” Mayor Marty Walsh said.  Guinness is also back on board as a sponsor of New York City’s parade, but that doesn’t mean elected officials are too. As they did last year, de Blasio and city council members are set to boycott 2015’s St Patrick’s Day parade. At the smaller, historically inclusive St Pat’s For All parade in Queens earlier this month, de Blasio let it be known that he believed the 5th Avenue parade’s organizers had not gone far enough.  “A lot of people feel, I think rightfully, that that is too small a change to merit a lot of us participating who have wanted to see an inclusive parade,” he said, according to the New York Times.  City council speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito released a strongly worded statement, saying, “Half measures will not suffice for a parade that should be open to everyone regardless of who they are or whom they love. It is my hope that someday soon parade organizers will realize that a more inclusive parade will be a better parade and will finally allow LGBTQ groups to march under their own banners. Proud Irish New Yorkers should not be forced to hide their identities - period.”  Robinson used his video appearance to address the concerns of de Blasio and skeptics directly. “I would say that we have long said that we agree. We agree that the parade should be more inclusive than this move even indicates,” he said. “But what we know is that sometimes progress comes in steps,” he continued. “We are excited to be the first group to help break the ban with the hopes that in subsequent years, the parade will be much more inclusive.”",2015-03-17T10:30:17Z,Inclusion of LGBT group in St Patrick's Day parade not enough: NY advocates,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-645fbe0e-dbaf-4a66-8266-abf2bd15b42b""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/16/1426543453890/b9788d92-1683-410e-963e-df8dcec11176-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Pro-gay rights protest 2014 St Patrick's Day Parade in New York"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A group of activists who have long advocated for the parade to allow LGBT individuals to march openly, said on Sunday that they planned to protest at the parade on Tuesday morning.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Taylor Hill/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",40,OUT@NBCUniversal has ties to parade’s broadcaster and critics across the city believe event is still discriminatory and marginalises Irish community<br>,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/16/1426543454173/45019366-d219-4347-9bb4-dd3860add781-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/17/advocates-inclusion-lgbt-group-st-patricks-day-parade-not-enough,3
"Russia is attempting to stop the United Nations extending staff benefits to same-sex spouses. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, announced in July 2014 it would recognise same-sex marriages among its 43,000 staff worldwide, allowing them to receive the same benefits as their heterosexual counterparts. Before the change of policy, UN workers’ personal status was determined by the laws of their country of nationality.  However, the body now recognises same-sex couples married in a country where it is legal, regardless of their nationality.  Russia wants the general assembly’s fifth committee, which is responsible for the UN budget, to overturn Ban’s decision and has asked for a vote on Tuesday. The fifth committee website states that action would be taken on the proposal on Tuesday. Diplomats said it was unclear how much support there was for the measure, which Russia has been threatening to put to a vote since December. The Russian UN mission declined to comment. UN-Globe, an organisation representing the UN’s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender staff, has long campaigned for legal same-sex unions to be recognised by all parts of the UN. The measure brought in last year does not extend to employees of UN agencies, such as Unicef or Unesco. A UN-Globe spokesman said it was been actively seeking to defeat the Russian moves and supported Ban’s decision last year to widen staff benefits, which it had “fought hard for”.  Ban has been a vocal supporter of LGBT rights since taking up his role, and condemned attacks and discrimination against gay people shortly before last year’s winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Russia triggered global criticism in 2013 when President Vladimir Putin signed into law a ban on “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations” to children.

"“It’s the trifecta,” a disappointed editor sighed as she waved for the check. “You wrote a book about lesbians, you went to Sarah Lawrence and you live in San Francisco.” When Alice+Freda Forever was published four months ago, I was somewhat amused by people’s determination to find the personal connection that motivated me to write my first novel on a same-sex love and murder. Even the so-called progressives in my life – the ones who made a point of telling me that their own wedding vows included a line about supporting same-sex marriage – persevered. If I wasn’t gay, surely my father or childhood friend or beloved teacher had to be. The real answer – that I was a young historian who found a relatively unknown, heartbreaking turn-of-the-century Southern tragedy –rarely sufficed. Did these same people think that an Elizabethan scholar must have direct ties to the 16th century, or that I, as the granddaughter of a Holocaust survivor, should only write about World War II? I’ve always thought events that proved significant in the past are about something much more fluid than dates and historical actors, conditions and consequences. History is about our values as a society. That’s an ever evolving story, and it needs new storytellers from every generation. Alice and Freda’s story is one of collective importance. Issues of American injustice have implications beyond any one community, and yet books like Alice+Freda Forever are most often found on the Gay &amp; Lesbian shelf, with no regard for the Library of Congress’ history, true crime, and gender categorization. (I’m looking at you, Barnes &amp; Noble.) Automatically assigning Alice and Freda to an identity category is probably well-intentioned, but in practice, we should consider how this reinforces discrimination. By setting some stories apart and calling them “LGBT History”, we risk carelessly implying that their history is not a part of our shared American history. We are saying that “their stories” are not “our stories”, and then we shelve those books in the farthest corner of the bookstores. My grandfather, Poppy – the Holocaust survivor – never quoted pastor Martin Niemoller’s famous poem, “First they came” – and he didn’t need to. Poppy’s stories about his youth in Poland and Germany weren’t just about mass atrocities and genocide, but about the ways in which we perpetuate difference, how “othering” is a choice we make. I saw him work against this, when he embraced the diversity of Los Angeles, resisting pressure to only associate with and hire other survivors in order to rebuild family through community. I thought about him when I spoke at a youth center in Memphis, Tennessee – the very same city Alice and Freda had lived in, and in which they are now buried. These teenagers, facing no small amount of discrimination at home, school and church in the Bible Belt, drove in from cities hours away, and they said that sitting there, listening to me in this refuge, made them feel something rare: lucky. They were there, together, in a safe place that didn’t exist for Alice and Freda. It was such a safe place that they didn’t feel the need to dance around their curiosity about me, and why I cared so much about the gay community. I talked about democracy and civil rights, all of which were received with respectful nods, but then I heard myself saying something I hadn’t said before: we could be more than just one thing, and certainly more than the thing we’re told we are. As the words were coming out of my mouth, I feared they sounded precious, but the audience’s eyes grew wide, their heads nodded, and they began clapping. The emails they sent me, so raw and hopeful and sincere, focused on this moment more than any other. I never planned for anything about my own personal history, much less my sexual orientation, to enter into the conversation, but it did, and while it still surprises me, I think it raises important questions. That’s the real work of history.",2015-02-19T16:45:08Z,Why is it so surprising that I care about LGBT history if I'm straight?,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""5207ab1fc8257259433e32819fbe39ae09b7cf90""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/5207ab1fc8257259433e32819fbe39ae09b7cf90/0_0_5261_3158/1000.jpg"" alt=""We can choose the way we perpetuate difference."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">We choose the way we perpetuate difference.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Alex Wong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",42,I never planned for my sexual orientation to enter into the conversation about my book.

"The Mormon church has spoken out about the “erosion of religious liberties” in the US as a result of what it sees as a rising tide of intimidation and retaliation from supporters of gay rights. In a rare public statement, the normally introspective top leadership of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints addressed the nation as well as its 15 million members worldwide about what it said was a significant modern problem. D Todd Christofferson, one of the 12 apostles who stand at the pinnacle of the church, said: “We want to share with you our concerns about the increasing tensions and polarization between advocates of religious freedom and advocates of gay rights.” The church’s comments come at a crucial time in the US. Same-sex marriage is spreading rapidly across the country, with 36 states now permitting it, and the US supreme court agreed this month to consider whether it should be allowed nationwide as a constitutional right. In that context, the Mormon church was offering a kind of double message to the country and beyond: the leadership also said it accepted legal protections for the LGBT community against discrimination in areas such as housing, employment or public service. A senior female leader of the church, Neill Marriott, said that for centuries there had been “ridicule, persecution and even violence against homosexuals and ultimately most of society realized that such treatment was simply wrong​”.   Related: Mormon scholar faces ban from church for stances on LGBT and women's rights    The church said it would back legislation in Utah, the state in which Mormonism found a home in the 19th century, that would extend statewide anti-discrimination prohibitions across the state. The move was seen as significant, with the local Salt Lake Tribune describing the endorsement as a “landmark announcement” that will give a major boost to the campaign to protect LGBT rights under the law. But the church leaders went on to state – in no uncertain terms – that homosexuality was against their beliefs and that they should have rights protected enough to say so. Marriott put it most bluntly, saying the church believes that “sexual relations other than between a man and a woman who are married are contrary to the laws of god. Such doctrine comes from sacred scripture and we are not at liberty to change it.” The rest of Tuesday’s rare press conference outlined the church’s vision of being under siege from intolerant outside forces. Dallin Oaks, another of the church’s 12 apostles, said the elders “look with alarm at the steady erosion of treasured freedoms guaranteed in the US constitution”. He listed cases which he said illustrated rising attacks on religious beliefs. They included the story of Peter Vidmar, an Olympic gold medal gymnast who stood down as symbolic head of the US Olympic team in 2012 after protests that he had backed California’s Proposition 8, which defined marriage as between a man and a woman. “Sadly, the list is expanding,” Oaks said. “Accusations of bigotry towards people simply because they are motivated by their religious faith and conscience have a chilling effect on freedom of speech and public debate.” Oaks accused LGBT advocates of trying to deny the very rights of expression they had fought for years to have themselves, which he described as “one of today’s great ironies”. “When religious people are publicly intimidated, retaliated against, forced from employment or made to suffer personal loss because they’ve raised their voice, donated to a cause or participated in an election,” Oaks said, “our democracy is the loser.”",2015-01-27T19:27:52Z,Mormon church breaks silence to warn against intolerance of LGBT advocates,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""f17277184dbe224bfe3ea2f28ea5f54257520232""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/27/1422385772102/81486f4f-4c50-4b3c-8779-ba931ab5344d-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""todd christofferson mormon church latter-day saints"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Elder D Todd Christofferson of the Church of the Latter-day Saints’ Quorum of the Twelve Apostles speaks during a news conference in Salt Lake City on Tuesday.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Rick Bowmer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>",43,In rare public comments the Church of the Latter-Day Saints endorsed Utah anti-discrimination laws but said religious people had a right to views based on faith,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/27/1422385772574/81486f4f-4c50-4b3c-8779-ba931ab5344d-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/27/mormon-church-breaks-silence-warn-intolerance-lgbt-advocates,7
"The Evangelical Christian owners of a bakery that refused to make a gay-themed cake discriminated against a client on grounds of his sexual orientation, Northern Ireland’s high court has heard. A lawyer for an LGBT activist suing the bakery, Ashers, said that “but for the word gay this order would have been fulfilled”. Robin Allen QC also told Belfast high court on Monday: “This case is direct discrimination.” Former Ashers customer Gareth Lee sued the bakery after it reversed an agreement to bake a cake with a pro-gay marriage message. The bakery initially accepted the order but 48 hours later handed back the payment to Lee, who had asked for a cake featuring the Sesame Street puppets Bert and Ernie. Lee had ordered it to mark last year’s election of the first openly gay mayor in Northern Ireland as well as to coincide with International Day against Homophobia last May. Allen said it should have been obvious to Ashers that the person making the request for an iced pro-gay marriage slogan was gay himself. “If you take the factual analysis, shorn of any meaning, it is the word gay in the phrase that was the cause of the differential treatment,” the lawyer said. “It is clear that if the word gay had been replaced by the word heterosexual, the order would have been accepted.” Allen also defended the equality commission of Northern Ireland’s decision to fund Lee’s case, arguing it had no other choice under the law.  But in his summary, David Scoffield QC, acting for the bakery, said if Lee’s argument was right, a Muslim printer could not turn down a contract to print leaflets about the prophet Muhammad, an atheist could not turn down an order saying God made the world and a Roman Catholic printer could not decline making leaflets calling for the legalisation of abortion on demand. Ashers’ lawyer said to force any of these individuals or his client to do this would infringe Article 9 (freedom of religion) of the Human Rights Act. “When someone is being forced to promote a cause with which they don’t agree, [it] is taking it a step too far,” Scoffield said.   District judge Isobel Brownlie told the court on the third day of the case that she wanted to give full consideration to the evidence: “It is not a straightforward area of the law. Obviously, this is a case in which I propose to reserve my judgment.” The case is a legally groundbreaking clash between Christian conscience and equality rights for the LGBT community in Northern Ireland, with Ashers now a global cause for Evangelical Christians across the world.  Ashers is named after one of the 12 sons of the biblical patriarch Jacob who “would provide delicacies fit for a king”. The firm, owned by the McArthur family, employs 80 people and sells its products across the UK and Ireland.

"As the US supreme court’s deliberation of same-sex marriage draws closer, lawmakers in several states are attempting to reign in other civil rights recently granted to the LGBT community. Conservative lawmakers from Kansas to Florida are working to repeal anti-discrimination laws, stop new ones from being enacted and expand laws on religious freedom.  On Thursday in Oklahoma, the state House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly for a bill which would protect members of the clergy who refuse to perform same-sex marriages. The bill now passes to the state Senate.   Related: Oklahoma bill provides immunity for clergy refusing to conduct gay marriages    In Arkansas, the state’s 35-member Senate has passed a bill barring municipalities from creating protected classes. The law is reportedly part of a backlash against city council members in Fayetteville, Arkansas, where a law barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation passed before being repealed by referendum. State lawmakers are touting the bill as an Intrastate Commerce Improvement Act, which would create legal uniformity. It is unclear whether Arkansas’ governor, Asa Hutchinson, will sign the bill into law. “People are very upset,” said Holly Dickson, legal director at the Arkansas American Civil Liberties Union, told BuzzFeed News. “As soon as LGBT people get some protections against being evicted or fired just because of who they love, the state is going to absolutely prohibit them from obtaining that sort of protection.” In Florida, Republican House member Frank Artiles introduced a bill that would bar transgender people from choosing a bathroom. Instead, the law defines gender as binary and declared “at birth” as either “male or female”. Violators could be charged with a misdemeanor and be sued. Artiles says the legislation is a meant to protect people in bathrooms, places of “increased vulnerability”. That bill is also in response to local legislators protecting the LGBT community. The Miami-Dade board of county commissioners passed an ordinance that bars discrimination on the basis of gender expression. In Kansas, Governor Sam Brownback reversed an executive order barring discrimination of state employees on the basis of sexual orientation – which had stood since 2007.   Related: Ruth Bader Ginsburg believes the US is ready for gay marriage    Equality Kansas called Brownback’s move “legalized discrimination” and scheduled a rally at the statehouse on Saturday, Valentine’s Day. “Governor Brownback has broken the promise this state made to its LGBT employees,” said Thomas Witt, Equality Kansas executive director in a statement announcing the rally.  “By rescinding the 2007 non-discrimination order issued by then-governor Kathleen Sebelius, Brownback has declared ‘open season’ on every LGBT state employee whose sexual orientation and gender identity have become known over the past eight years.” In 2014, conservatives in Arizona and Michigan also attempted to pass religious freedom laws. Both would have permitted business owners and workers to refuse service to the LGBT community; both were dropped after vigorous lobbying from the business community.",2015-02-13T13:27:50Z,"As gay marriage bans fall, LGBT rights come under fire from state legislatures","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""b215c62b4b6a01fef95e6b117aecfd47b151c9a7""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/13/1423833593423/18618f49-03da-4d94-a0f9-4323b1c06f4f-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""gay marriage protesters"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Gay marriage protesters in Kansas.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Mark Reinstein/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>",45,"From bill protecting clergy refusing to conduct gay marriages to law defining gender as binary, several states attempt to beat back rising tide of acceptance ",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/13/1423833593797/18618f49-03da-4d94-a0f9-4323b1c06f4f-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/13/lgbt-rights-under-fire-oklahoma-arkansas-florida-kansas,7
"Tottenham and Arsenal’s meeting at White Hart Lane on Saturday is generating much excitement, yet it is unlikely the contest will come close to matching the scoring and surrealness of this week’s other north London derby. For those who missed it, Spurs won 7-1 thanks to a hat-trick from an IT consultant while Arsenal’s consolation goal came from a penalty given out of sympathy by the referee Steffen Freund. And yes, it was the Steffen Freund. The former Germany international is no ordinary official but then this was no ordinary game. Instead, the coming together of north London rivals on a cold Tuesday afternoon at a five-a-side centre in Edmonton was a celebration of a growing and important movement in English football, that of LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) supporters groups. Two of the most prominent are the Proud Lilywhites and Gay Gooners and under the watch of Freund, a one-time Spurs player and coach, the former marked their first birthday in style.     The celebratory five-a-side match in London’s Edmonton was refereed by Tottenham coach and former midfielder Steffen Freund. Photograph: Andy Hall for The Guardian    In truth, the thrashing of local foe mattered less to those on the winning side – including hat-trick hero Laura Bint – than the fact they had a reason to stage the game in the first place. A year ago, Proud Lilywhites had only 10 members and aspirations of working towards making the experience of watching Tottenham a wholly welcoming and safe one for LGBT fans. Now the group is 130-strong and has an official relationship with the club, one that has led to a rainbow flag being permanently on show at White Hart Lane and group officials maintaining regular contact with Spurs board members. “Spurs organised for Steffen to be at the five-a-side and regularly allow us to have pieces in the matchday programme and do stuff around the stadium aimed at spreading our message, such as handing out leaflets, which we’ll again do before Saturday’s derby,” says Proud Lilywhites co-chair Christina Paouros. “That’s very important to us and hopefully over the next 12 months our relationship will grow even stronger.” Gay Gooners have been running for a year longer and boast more than 250 members. They also maintain a strong relationship with their club, one that led to a rainbow banner being in residence at the Emirates – a new one was unveiled before Arsenal’s 5-0 victory over Aston Villa there on Sunday – as well as space being given over in the programme and through other official channels for publicity of the group’s message.     Gay Gooner Dave Raval proudly poses outside Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium. Photograph: David Levene for The Guardian    The growing strength of Proud Lilywhites and Gay Gooners is welcome news, as is that of the other recognised LGBT supporters groups that have been set up across the country in recent years – Canal Street Blues (Manchester City), LFC LGBT (Liverpool), Pride of Irons (West Ham), Proud and Palace (Crystal Palace), Proud Canaries (Norwich City), Rainbow Toffees (Everton) and Rainbow Tractors (Ipswich Town). Yet their very existence is also a shame, highlighting that even in 2015 homophobia remains a significant enough problem in English football that fans from the LGBT community feel they need representation and protection. “There’s no doubt discrimination still exists among supporters here,” insists Gay Gooners’ media coordinator, Dave Raval. “Just look at the ‘gay banter’ Brighton fans still have to endure. Also, how often do you see two men or two women holding hands at a match here? Rarely, if ever, and that’s because those who’d like to simply don’t feel it’s safe to do so. Football remains an unaccepting environment for gay people and for our members; part of the reason for joining Gay Gooners is to have the assurance of safety in numbers whenever they go to a game.     Proud Lilywhites members enjoy the atmosphere at a five-a-side match to celebrate the group’s one-year anniversary. Photograph: Andy Hall for The Guardian    “The way to overcome that fear is to normalise homosexuality in English football and make the presence of openly gay fans in the stands – as well as openly gay players, managers and referees on the pitch – a complete non-issue. For that to happen visibility is key, and that’s why the banner was a big win for us. Hopefully it is spreading the message to the whole LGBT community that the Emirates welcomes them – and the more that come the more we can normalise the environment there.” Statistics compiled by the equality campaigners Kick It Out show that homophobic abuse at football matches in this country remains a prevalent issue and, worryingly, could be on the rise. During the 2013-14 season, 12 cases of discrimination based on sexual orientation occurring in the professional game were reported to the organisation with five proven. Between the start of this season and 28 December, there were nine reported cases, with two proven so far. “It’s difficult to know whether there are more incidents occurring or if fans have become more knowledgable about reporting to us,” Roisin Wood, director of Kick It Out, told the Guardian. “We definitely need to create greater awareness about the methods available to supporters to raise a complaint if they see, hear or are the victim of LGBT discrimination.”     Tottenham coach Steffen Freund with members of the Proud Lilywhites and Gay Gooners LGBT supporters groups. Photograph: Andy Hall for The Guardian    Kick It Out has an app by which spectators can report homophobic abuse to them, while the Football Association has a similar facility on its website. The governing body also strives to maintain an active presence in the fight against homophobia in English football, seen in the workshops it organised last year which brought together representatives from the Premier League and Football League with those involved in the LGBT supporters movement, most notably the Gay Football Supporters’ Network, which provides umbrella backing for the nine fan groups and is in the process of helping set up others at clubs including Aston Villa, Sunderland and Reading. Leviathen Hendricks, the GFSN secretary, said: “I know many diehard fans who’ve only seen their team play once or twice in the flesh because, as a member of the LGBT community, they’ve felt frightened by the experience of going to a live game. The supporters groups are bringing these people back to football, which is hugely encouraging and is why we’re keen to set up as many as possible. “Social media helps in that regard as it allows supporters groups to quickly and broadly alert LGBT fans to their presence. It also alerts us to the presence of start-up groups which we can then help grow.”     A year ago Proud Lilywhites had just 10 members but now have a membership of 130. Gay Gooners, established in 2013, have over 250. Photograph: Andy Hall for The Guardian    Social media can also cause problems, as seen last month with the case of the Charlton Rainbows Twitter account, which claimed to represent LGBT supporters of the south London club and reported some of them had been attacked before the home match against Brighton. After an investigation the Metropolitan Police discovered there had been no such incident, and the account was deleted soon after. “Things like that don’t help with the push to form supporters groups – it creates anxiety and uncertainty within the LGBT community,” adds Hendricks. “That’s why it’s important that all groups get some sort of backing from their clubs. Legitimacy is essential.” Unlike Proud Lilywhites and Gay Gooners, LFC LGBT does not have an official link with Liverpool but the two work closely together, so much so that the former was able to get updated anti-discrimination signage put up at the club’s stadium. It reads: “Anfield has given violence racism, foul language and homophobia the boot.”     Proud Lilywhites beat Gay Gunners 7-1 in the match to celebrate the former group’s one-year anniversary. Photograph: Andy Hall for The Guardian    LFC LGBT founder Paul Amann says: “We’re also working with the club to get a batch of seats together for at least one game a season. This is particularly important for our trans supporters who have a real fear about attending games because of the things they hear when they’re there, such as a transphobic chant that used to be directed at Fernando Torres whenever he returned to Anfield with Chelsea. I’m not saying Liverpool supporters are homophobic – most I know are hugely supportive of the work we do. But like many fans across the country they can create an atmosphere which makes members of the LGBT community feel football is not for them.” For Amann, there are clear parallels between the work being done by groups such as LFC LGBT, Proud Lilywhites and Gay Gooners and that of those who decades earlier fought to end racism in English football. “I’m mixed race and remember the environment that existed in the 70s and 80s when bananas were thrown on the pitch and the National Front were on the terraces,” he says. “That would be unthinkable now and the same can happen in regards to attitudes to the LGBT community. Football can and should be a welcoming place for all people.” The nine “recognised” LGBT supporters’ groups that exist in the Premier League currently Gay Gooners (Arsenal) – @gaygooners Proud Lilywhites (Tottenham) – @SpursLGBT LFC LGBT (Liverpool) – @LFC_LGBT Canal Street Blues (Man City) – @CanalStBlues Rainbow Toffees (Everton) – @RainbowToffees Rainbow Tractors (Ipswich) – @RainbowTractors Proud Canaries (Norwich) – @proudcanaries Pride of Irons (West Ham) – @PrideOfIrons Proud and Palace (Crystal Palace) – @ProudandPalace",2015-02-05T22:00:05Z,Proud Lilywhites and Gay Gooners fly (rainbow) flag for LGBT football fans,"<figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2015/feb/05/football-homophobia-proud-lilywhites-gay-gooners-video""            data-short-url=""http://gu.com/p/45gp7""                        data-video-id=""2236525""            data-video-name=""Football v Homophobia: Proud Lilywhites took on Gay Gooners to bring LGBT fans together – video""            data-video-provider=""guardian.co.uk""            data-video-poster=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/2/5/1423140804083/crop_KP_86617_640x360.png""> <video data-media-id=""gu-video-455318884"" class=""gu-video"" controls=""controls"" poster=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/2/5/1423140802050/crop_KP_86617_1200x720.png""> <source src=""http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/02/05/150205LGBTFootballFanGroups_desk.mp4""></source><source src=""http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10040132&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700""></source><source src=""http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/02/05/150205LGBTFootballFanGroups.m3u8""></source><source src=""http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/02/05/150205LGBTFootballFanGroups_synd_768k_vp8.webm""></source><source src=""http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/02/05/150205LGBTFootballFanGroups_large.3gp""></source> </video> <figcaption>Football v Homophobia: Proud Lilywhites took on Gay Gooners in a match to bring together LGBT fans – video</figcaption> </figure>",46,"LGBT fan groups are on the rise, giving reassuring strength in numbers for supporters.

"Whether you’re gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender, being open about your sexuality is good for business. Hiding your sexuality or gender, on the other hand, will have a negative financial impact. That is the conclusion of a new piece of research benchmarking the level of LGBT tolerance in UK workplaces.   Related: Out and abroad: businesses have a responsibility to support gay staff    Surveying 200 senior UK business people identifying as LGBT, professional network OUTstanding suggests that, while many big corporations are embracing diversity as a positive, there are issues around implementing inclusive policies at mid-management level.

The January 2015 OUTstanding report, which focuses on LGBT diversity – and is the only one of its kind – supports this research, correlating a lack of diversity at senior business level to a loss in profitability.  In fact, 85% of those taking the OUTstanding survey said closeted LGBT professionals waste energy pretending to be someone they’re not. Suki Sandhu, chief executive and founder of OUTstanding, says: “Fundamentally, inclusion is about productivity. If you foster an environment of inclusiveness it allows you to retain the best talent, encourage innovation and empower employees to bring their whole selves to work.” Claudia Brind-Woody is managing director of global intellectual property licensing at IBM, recently named in Stonewall’s list of top global LGB employers and one of the companies listed as a champion of LGBT rights in the UK and abroad. Brind-Woody took the survey and says that being out is a good value proposition for business.  “If the people in the majority don’t listen to folks who are different, you get that ‘group think’, you miss the opportunities for innovation and you also impact your teamwork. If you assume your clients are straight you’ll be wrong 5%-10% of the time. Being able to connect to a client on multiple dimensions adds business value,” she says, adding that once people do come out they get their energy back and they perform better.   Related: How construction industry can address LGBT discrimination    Still, 41% of American LGBT-identifying employees remain closeted at work and 62% of graduates return to the closet upon taking their first job. Jeffrey Krogh, managing director of media and telecom finance at BNP Paribas, spent 10 years disguising his same-sex relationship at work. He believes that the biggest cost of being in the closet is the impact it has on both talent and productivity: “There’s a lot of worrying, planning and energy that goes into being in the closet. That is energy that could otherwise be channelled to the job that you’re there to do.” Originally from Denmark, Krogh moved to the UK in the 1990s and, before starting his first job in London, senior friends of his advised him that “at best, being gay is not a problem, but it’s never actually going to help you”. At his first team drinks he found out the team leader was religious and, unsure of the consequences of disclosing his sexuality, he decided it was easier to say nothing. It wasn’t until 10 years later that he came out at work by sending an email to his bosses – one day before his wedding. “In hindsight that was obviously the wrong decision, I should have done that much sooner,” he says.  Despite the progress that’s been made, Krogh believes companies need to rethink attitudes: “In the past, law firms, banks and finance institutions were flooded with all the best talent, who were quite happy to go into the kind of culture that that world represents. That is changing as the new digital world opens up for more diverse career paths,” he says. “I think organisations realise they have to work harder at attracting talent and it’s great that they have woken up to the fact that actually standing out as an inclusive organisation means something to people.”   Related: What holds women back in the workplace?    The OUTstanding report highlights that only 24% of those surveyed think people in middle management have an inclusive attitude towards LGBT colleagues. “What that shows is that sometimes that message isn’t filtering down,” says Sandhu, adding that companies need a slick internal communication process to disseminate information further down the ladder. “That’s why I think it’s important that we try and encourage leaders to come out, so that there are more role models. The other thing is that we can encourage allies to come out and be visible, and show that they support the LGBT agenda.” Krogh agrees that change needs to come from the top. “I think that boards ought to be more focused on making it a real agenda item and saying that ‘if we want to change something we need to start with ourselves’. Someone needs to champion it, otherwise it won’t happen.” In the meantime, the fact that 99% of 200 LGBT business figures say that the act of coming out was less of a traumatic experience than expected may encourage more to do just that.

"Discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people remains rife in everyday areas of British life, the Law Society warned on the eve of Saturday's 2013 Pride parade in London.Despite the recent parliamentary backing for the marriage (same sex couples) bill, which details government plans for same-sex marriages in England and Wales, the society's president said it was ""not yet a job done"" and ""won't weed out deep-rooted cultural discrimination"".Lucy Scott-Moncrieff added: ""Gay inequality is closer to home than most people think. It's not a foreign phenomenon. Our neighbours, our friends and our children are being discriminated against and treated adversely.""""Despite legal protections in place, gay inequality remains rife in the UK. A tendency to discriminate against LGBT people is present in everyday areas of life – in the workplace, in the playground, at the sports arena. This is unacceptable, embarrassing and shocking.""The Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, pointed to four areas where it said discrimination was still taking place, including access to housing and using hotels, restaurants and banks.In employment, the society said many LGBT people still faced taunts, ridicule and other forms of discrimination in the workplace, while LGBT asylum seekers were put under increasing pressure to ""prove"" their sexual orientation, after facing extreme stigmatisation, isolation and physical and mental harm in their countries of origin.Meanwhile, David Cameron has said that equal marriage reforms will allow gay schoolchildren to ""stand a little bit taller"".Writing in the official Pride guide, he said: ""There will be girls and boys in school today who are worried about being bullied and concerned about what society thinks of them because they are gay or lesbian.""""By making this change they will be able to see that Parliament believes their love is the same as anyone else's love and that we believe in equality. I think this will enable them to stand that bit taller, be that bit more confident and I am proud of that.""The Pride parade will travel through the heart of London, along Oxford Street and Regent Street before ending up on Whitehall, and will be followed by events across the city.Organisers said around 150 groups are involved in this year's parade and urged visitors to join in the celebrations.Michael Salter, chairman of Pride in London, said: ""London is an amazingly diverse city attracting the most talented people from across the world, which is vital to the economic welfare of our city.""Among the sponsors is the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, who apologised after making a controversial joke at a gala dinner for Pride in London earlier this week about gay men taking their husbands ""up the Arcelor"" – a reference to the ArcelorMittal Orbit sculpture in the Olympic Park.",2013-06-28T18:02:26Z,"Discrimination against LGBT people still rife, says Law Society",,48,"Despite parliamentary backing for gay marriage bill, fight against discrimination is 'not yet a job done', says society on eve of 2013 Pride parade",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/28/1372442510329/Pride-parade-in-London-005.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/28/discrimination-lgbt-rife-gay-marriage-pride-parade,5
"The man who may soon be the first openly gay person elected as a governor in the US sat silently in Maine’s house of representatives as an older colleague embarked on a homophobic tirade against the anti-discrimination proposal that they were considering. “I don’t see them as gay because they never smile, they have got that withdrawn look,” J Robert Carrier, a Democrat from Westbrook, told the chamber in Augusta in May 1983, as a 28-year-old Mike Michaud looked on. “I feel sorry for those people,” said Carrier.  Urging fellow lawmakers to vote against a bill that would have outlawed discrimination against Maine’s estimated 100,000 gay citizens for housing or jobs, Carrier said that just as “if you want to be a drunk, if you want to be a liar, if you want to be a thief, if you want to be a crook”, the solution to homosexuality was “self-discipline”.  Proponents of the bill spoke out passionately, likening the persecution of gays at the time to the shameful treatment of black people and women that required corrective legislation in the past. One even raised the spectre of the Third Reich’s actions against unwanted minorities. But Michaud, who in coming out 30 years later would say he was “brought up believing you should judge a person based on the content of his or her character” rather than sexual orientation, said nothing. Instead, he lined up with Carrier and 99 other House members and voted to kill the proposal. Then he addressed the House on the merits of a plan to allow the hunting of coyotes at night. “I think we ought to at least give it a chance,” he said.  The young Democrat, representing his rural home district between working shifts at a paper mill there, remained quiet for years through years of more colourfully intolerant remarks as the measure repeatedly came up for debate. He made 18 similar votes against it during his 22 years in Maine’s legislature, and was among just five state senators to oppose it even up to its long-awaited passage in 1997. Now one of the state’s two members of the US House of Representatives, where he has served six terms, he was reserved when Maine passed gay marriage legislation in 2009, even as his colleague, Chellie Pingree, took to the floor of the US House to endorse it. (The people of the state voted later that year to repeal the law; gay marriages were eventually allowed after a referendum in 2012.) It is a record that has left some veteran equality campaigners cool about Michaud’s candidacy for governor even as he attempts to secure a landmark political victory for their cause on Tuesday by unseating Governor Paul LePage, the Republican incumbent, who is seeking what would be his second term.  “Gay or not, Mike was not there,” said Betsy Smith, who led EqualityMaine, the state’s oldest and biggest gay rights advocacy group, for 14 years until 2013. “He just was not there.”  Michaud’s own sexuality – and “many of us knew for many, many years,” said Smith – only made his lack of support more frustrating, she said. Smith made headlines last year by endorsing Eliot Cutler, an independent candidate for the governorship, who claims a longer and more consistent record of supporting gay rights. Critics accuse Michaud of making a stronger commitment to LGBT equality only in the relative safety of recent years.  This week, he struck a rueful note. “I could make excuses but I won’t,” he told the Guardian. “I regret some of my earlier votes and feel fortunate that friends and constituents continued to talk with me and share their stories so that I could gain a greater understanding of the issue.” Cutler, a wealthy lawyer, likes to recount how, by contrast, he grew up watching his parents receive death threats after his father, the chairman of the University of Maine’s board, supported its first gay and lesbian student group in the early 1970s. He has personally donated and helped raise tens of thousands of dollars for gay rights causes. He is, however, trailing far behind both Michaud and LePage, who appear to be virtually neck-and-neck, in polls. Smith said that for some liberals and LGBT rights advocates who would otherwise support Cutler, the election has therefore become “a referendum on LePage”, who opposes same-sex marriage, accused a state legislator of shafting the public “without providing Vaseline”, and once said that he could not see “how people, at least sane people, would want to allow transgender in our primary schools and our high schools”. Earlier this week, Cutler said at a press conference at which it was believed he would drop out of the running that he would remain in the race but that he was a realist, and that his supporters should vote for another candidate if they feared that backing him could result in a victory for their least favourite out of LePage and Cutler. The move was widely expected to assist the Democrat. Supporters of Cutler favour Michaud over LePage 55% to 35%, Public Policy Polling found in a survey conducted last week. Of the Cutler supporters polled, 73% had a negative view of LePage, and the poll showed Michaud would lead 49-44 in a head-to-head race.     Maine independent gubernatorial candidate Eliot Cutler, Governor Paul LePage, and Mike Michaud, participate in a debate in Portland, Maine, lasst month. Photograph: Robert F. Bukaty/AP    Cutler, however, declines to tip his hand to either of the “two lousy choices”, and is scathing about Michaud’s record on gay rights. “I find it unforgivable,” he told the Guardian. “It is inconceivable to me how someone could have voted no to equality unless they put crass politics above principle. And that happened every time. I would never vote for him.” Michaud has suggested that if he had backed gay rights at the time he would have been voted out by his constituents in Penobscot county, where close-knit Franco-American Catholic families like his own – “I’m 100% French,” he said in 2000 – made for a socially conservative electorate. “Cutler, he never ran for office,” Michaud said earlier this month. “It’s easy to say one thing, but he has never had a history or a record.” Michaud also opposed gun control and abortion rights at the time, yet is now endorsed by Planned Parenthood after he declared once he made it to Congress: “My views on abortion have evolved.” Maine’s consistent support for Democratic presidential nominees since the early 1990s belies a moderate streak that will probably see Susan Collins, its Republican senior senator, emphatically re-elected next week. Michaud is the only New Englander in the “Blue Dog” group of conservative Democrats. But Cutler is contemptuous of Michaud’s excuses. “Oh, please,” he said. “Many others who represented more conservative districts found that it was possible to vote yes.” Smith, the former EqualityMaine chief, concurs. “There are people who took hard votes,” she said. Ann Rand, a Democrat who co-sponsored the equality measure while representing a liberal Portland seat in the state house in the 1980s, said that Michaud did not cast his no votes happily. “He never lobbied against us. He once told me ‘Ann, I promise I would never cast the deciding vote’,” she said. Praising him as her hardest-working colleague, she said: “Maybe we all have something we look back on and say probably we could have done differently.”  Michaud stresses that since entering Congress he has pushed for equality, co-sponsoring ENDA, a longstanding proposal for a nationwide anti-discrimination measure comparable to the one he repeatedly rejected as a state lawmaker. He stresses that public attitudes have changed dramatically over the course of his career and claims: “My record tells a story of progress”. The Human Rights Campaign, which gives him a 100% rating for the current Congress, has endorsed him for governor. Under its new leadership, EqualityMaine has done the same – much to Cutler’s fury.  Matt McTighe, Michaud’s campaign manager, led the successful state referendum on same-sex marriage, and has publicly attested to the candidate’s commitment to equality. The state Democratic party is eager to stress that Cutler has recently accepted money from conservatives who typically “only back the most extreme, conservative, anti-gay, anti-choice candidates in the country”. and are trying to prop him up to draw votes from the Democrat. Michaud’s sexuality has proved to be a non-issue in the campaign. As he appeared in Portland on Thursday night alongside a Democrat who once made history of his own, there was little clue – and no reference – to the landmark victory that could be in store next week. “We are Mainers young and old, rich and poor, male and female, black and white, gay and straight,” was all Michaud said on the issue, before introducing President Barack Obama. Stating that his personal life had “never factored into how I do my job”, Michaud wrote when coming out last year: “I don’t plan to make my personal life or my opponents’ personal lives an issue in this campaign.” But some in Maine feel that he might have done more to help push America to a point where that was possible.",2014-11-01T12:49:39Z,Maine could elect the country's first gay governor – but LGBT activists are split,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""594ff0f7895761dd27c6b27b975951c57528a163""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/1/1414845271682/dcaa8faa-569b-46be-a052-b44652fe0b4f-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""mike michaud"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">President Barack Obama raises arms with Mike Michaud, the Maine Democratic gubernatorial candidate, during a campaign rally in Portland, Maine, on Thursday.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Charles Krupa/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>",49,Democrat Mike Michaud is in a neck-and-neck race with incumbent Paul LePage but he persistently voted against gay rights legislation before coming out,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/1/1414845272011/dcaa8faa-569b-46be-a052-b44652fe0b4f-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/01/maine-first-gay-governor-lgbt-activists-split,7

"Tim Cook came out Thursday – sort of – in Bloomberg Businessweek, which was probably the most appropriate venue for the Apple CEO to finally be open about his sexuality, three years after Gawker dubbed him “the most powerful gay man in America.” But let’s not fall all over ourselves with unmitigated joy. Cook is just the latest gay man or lesbian to come out long after he got his – and that’s not “courage”, and it’s hardly even pride. We all come out, often repeatedly, at the time that is right for each of us. But when clearly powerful people understand their sexuality and stay in the closet, even by omission, it is no reason to bust out the confetti – especially while there are so many queer people out doing the hard work of achieving equality and liberation at great risk to themselves. Like Ricky Martin, Anderson Cooper, and Robin Roberts most recently before him, Cook came out long into a career that is secure, and with a fat bank account and a legion of lawyers and supporters to protect him from any blowback. For someone like Cook, who chose to “pass” for years, to now ask the LGBT community he’s been unwilling to publicly admit he’s a part of to celebrate the “brick” he’s added on “the sunlit path toward justice” feels to me like a black person parading around in white face, taking all the benefits of whiteness, getting rich and then scrubbing off the makeup and saying, “Surprise! I’m proud to be black!” Why do we celebrate these people who have never stood up as one of us until they are rich and famous? Cook is just the latest example of equality being heralded in a corporate space – providing a de-radicalized, homo-normatizing and apolitical approach to LGBT rights. Not barring the gay CEO from the premises doesn’t automatically lead to massive social change on the scale of, say, a federal law banning LGBT employment discrimination or adding LGBT protections to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Celebrating a CEO (whom everyone knew was gay) officially coming out is more like celebrating that the New York City St Patrick’s Day Parade – which hasn’t ever allowed out gay groups to march – is allowing one corporate NBC Universal employee group to march in 2015 while not welcoming the queer Irish groups which have fought the ban for decades.  I am worried about how Cook’s announcement will again frame gay civil rights primarily around marriage and not around political liberation or economic freedom, and also how it may again frame gayness as something that happens to rich white men. And, if Cook believes “deeply in the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, who said, ‘Life’s most persistent and urgent question is, ‘What are you doing for others?’ ” then his company might want to consider taking seriously the well-being of its suicidal workers at its factories. He might think about what Dr. King would think of Apple allegedly engaging in hiring practices that purportedly violated antitrust laws, with the same workers who created the wealth that everyone was apparently so worried might be reduced if too many people knew the CEO was gay.  Steven-Emmanuel Martinez, a health educator, told me: “I am glad [Cook] realized there is a lot of agency in a young, gay boy from Alabama growing up to be a successful CEO ... But I am much more interested in seeing what he does next.” He explained:  Can you put your money where your heart is? What are you going to do for LGBT homeless youth? What are you going to do about HIV/AIDS knowing it has a high burden in the south and in your home state? How are you going to use your seat as a powerful executive [to] open up the debate beyond marriage equality and beyond coming out? How will this serve people who aren’t in your position?”  Cook might want to consider the possibility that Apple, one of the two most valued corporations on the face of this earth, should pay U.S. taxes, so that our society could confront the economic ills Martinez raises which LGBT people face. That’s not to suggest that there’s some great consensus on what Cook means for gay rights. Brian Ellner, who ran the Human Rights Campaign’s marriage equality efforts in New York State in 2011, told me “I think it’s an enormous deal when arguably one of the most successful CEOs of one of the most successful corporations in the world decides to come out.” He added, “There’s been a real dearth of CEOs who have come out, and that’s likely to change now.” But I don’t care whether Tim Cook – or any other CEO – is gay and eventually admits it to the world at large. In the era in which a CEO’s coming-out essay is published in a magazine for other businessmen, he’s not trying to be visible to the LGBT community as much as to the straight, white male readers of a business magazine. (It would have been much more “gay” if he’d used one of his new iPhones and posted his picture to Grindr.) But regardless of how Cook left the closet, being gay isn’t enough to play on our team anymore, not when you’re also rich and powerful – we need someone who will go to bat for us, too.",2014-10-31T11:45:11Z,Tim Cook is gay.

"There is no official benchmark for LGBT inclusion at an executive level, but businesses worldwide are starting to put diversity on the agenda. Executives who strive for LGBT equality were celebrated on Thursday when a list of the world’s top 100 LGBT leaders, as well as one of the top 20 straight allies (heterosexual people who strongly support LGBT inclusion) was revealed in London. Compiled by professional network Outstanding, the lists saw Christopher Bailey, chief creative and chief executive of Burberry, hailed as the most influential LGBT businessperson, while Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson was named greatest straight ally. Bailey also became the first openly gay CEO of a FTSE 100 company this year, a measure in itself of the progress made since the inaugural Outstanding list in 2013. Looking at the industries on the list as an index of inclusivity shows progress within sectors not usually associated with LGBT diversity. Banking, financial services, and the technical sector are all well represented. However, perhaps unsurprisingly, white gay males come out on top. The list has 24% women, few from ethnic minorities, no bisexual and only three transgender nominees. The lack of diversity within the list likely reflects the boardrooms worldwide. It may also be an indication of the stigma associated with race and gender within business. A lack of diversity Claudia Brind-Woody, vice president and managing director of Global Intellectual Property Licensing at IBM is 10th on the list of LGBT executives. She said women have a double stigma to overcome. “You do have women who choose not to come out because of what people call the double-glazed glass ceiling. Research by Stonewall and Catalyst has shown that women hesitate to raise their hand again and come out because they are already discriminated against.” Suki Sandhu, founder of Outstanding is hoping to see more diversity in coming years. “Not having any bisexual people [on the list] is a big issue but there are also very few ethnic minorities leaders [listed],” he says, adding that last year’s list inspired many new LGBT leaders to come forward. The transgender community is also under-represented with no male trans nominees, unsurprising when 90% of transgender employees (pdf) experience harassment at work, according to a 2011 transgender discrimination survey. Isabella Segal, partner at Nyman Libson Paul and 96th on the list, told her fellow partners of her plans to transition in August 2012 and, having worked out a strategy with her partners of how to break the news, she started living as a woman in 2013. “We were in unchartered waters … I walked in [to the office] very nervous and very apprehensive, and nobody said a word.” The non-reaction was precisely what she had hoped for. “I’ve had a remarkably understanding environment, helped particularly by my managing partner Joel Newman who has been very supportive.” She encourages all business to show that level of support and, when it comes to the transition, give colleagues and clients plenty of warning. “Do it in an empathetic manner so that when the actual physical transition happens people are aware and it’s done as seamlessly as you can.” Inclusion makes business sense too A supportive environment is equally important to gay and bisexual people. “[It] was one of the reasons I chose to join IBM because they enabled me to work in an environment where I could be authentic,” says Brind-Woody, proving many LGBT people look at the policies in place before taking a new job. “Workplace climate matters. Having a workplace that’s welcoming and inclusive enables people to succeed on their own merit,” she says. One of the key support mechanisms at IBM is providing LGBT people with leadership training and its clear stand on diversity helps the company attract, retain and advance talent. “It also helps us to do business with our clients when they feel comfortable that IBM as a company respects and values who they are.” Sandhu hopes industries not currently represented on the list will see it as a call to action to look at different ways of creating an inclusive workplace. “Fundamentally inclusion is about productivity. It’s about getting the most out of your workforce, it’s about letting your employees be themselves … which ultimately will improve their profitability and shareholder’s value,” he said. Far from an equal playing field There is no definitive answer to how many business executives are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender because there has never been a survey conducted asking board members about their sexuality or preferred gender pronoun. With no one asking these questions, few business people are coming out, and the message of openness, diversity and inclusion, which most LGBT champions agree must come from the top, gets lost. With no statistics to rely on, the progress that is needed to enable LGBT people to be themselves at work, is difficult to measure. At the same time, one study from the Centre for Talent Innovation 2013 says 41% of LGBT people (pdf) do not feel comfortable disclosing their sexuality at work while another from the Human Rights Campaign reports that 62% of generation Y LGBT graduates return into the closet upon taking their first job. Outstanding is looking into conducting research to establish a ratio of openly LGBT people at an executive level; until then its annual list provides a benchmark for diversity in business.

"President Barack Obama on Monday signed an executive order that bars discrimination against transgender federal employees, and adds people who identify as LGBT to a list of those against whom federal contractors can not discriminate. “We’re on the right side of history,” Obama said at a press conference. “America’s federal contractors should not subsidize discrimination against the American people.” The narrowly tailored executive order is seen as a partial victory for gay rights groups. A bill stalled in Congress would offer protection nationally to employees identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, but it hasn&apos;t seen movement since November. Further, Obama&apos;s action doesn&apos;t change a religious exemption put in place in an executive order issued by President George W Bush. Religious entities, such as corporations and schools, can continue to use such convictions as a factor when making employment decisions.  That galvanized sides of the gay rights debate before the order was signed, in one instance putting faith leaders at odds.  More than a dozen religious leaders, including large nonprofits such as Catholic Charities, urged Obama to exempt such institutions from the order, arguing that “this expansion of hiring rights will come at an unreasonable cost to the common good, national unity and religious freedom.” In response, the Interfaith Alliance led a drive to collect more than 100 signatures urging the president to cover religious entities&apos; employment practices in the action. Reverend Dr C Welton Gaddy, who leads the alliance, said he &quot;whole-heartedly&quot; supported Obama&apos;s action on Monday, but was &quot;disappointed that he did not go further to undo the provisions that President George W Bush signed allowing for religious organizations to discriminate against people of other religions in their hiring.&quot; The letter called such an exemption a &quot;terrible precedent&quot;. The executive order echoes a recent supreme court decision on religious convictions. The court exempted the faith-affiliated craft supply company Hobby Lobby from a requirement to provide birth control through insurance coverage, a tenet of Obama’s signature healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act. Obama&apos;s order builds on two more – one signed in 1965 by President Lyndon B Johnson barred discrimination by federal contractors on the grounds of race and sex. The second, signed by Richard Nixon in 1969, barred discrimination by the government itself.",2014-07-21T17:06:51Z,Obama signs executive order to protect LGBT federal employees,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-9b369b05-7b60-4db0-b631-ec7ab59e67cf""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/21/1405962287836/5fbd2e4d-2838-4550-9ec4-f6a12e9d9f6a-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Obama signs LGBT executive order"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Obama signs executive orders to protect LGBT employees from federal workplace discrimination.

"Four years ago, Konstantin Yablotskiy was not looking to change his life. He had travelled to Cologne to attend the Gay Games, an LGBT-friendly athletics festival. He was a figure skater, not an activist. Most of his friends or family did not even know he was gay. But then he took to the ice in front of a fully accepting audience, receiving whistles and applause on as he spun to a mid-tempo jazz number, later earning gold and silver medals for his performances. He watched athletes from around the world competing openly, unafraid of expressing their orientation. Before Yablotskiy left, he decided that he would would organize an LGBT athletics organization in his home country, Russia.  When he returned to the Gay Games this year, Yablotskiy was leading a team of 33 athletes representing the 1,000-plus membership of the Russian LGBT Sports Federation.  The Gay Games are a week-long athletics and cultural festival held every four years. This year’s games, held jointly in Cleveland, Ohio, and nearby Akron, and which culminate on Saturday, have drawn nearly 8,000 participants from more than 50 countries, competing in sports from football to bowling to synchronized swimming.  Since they began in 1982, the Gay Games stated goal has been to display the athletic ability of the LGBT community, promoting equality by showing that gay and lesbian athletes are just the same as their heterosexual peers. Organizers promote full inclusion at the events, allowing participation regardless of sexual orientation, gender, race, ideology or physical ability. The long tail of the games, however, has been in empowering participants to create change in their own communities, especially in places where LGBT rights remain elusive.  “Many countries that have very anti-LGBT policies, if you’re doing a sports event they will give it a pass,” says Kelly Murphy-Stevens a board member of the Federation of Gay Games. “They just can’t imagine that this is a big deal.” As a member of the board, Murphy-Stevens is involved with outreach and providing scholarships for athletes from countries that are underrepresented at the games. In most cases, these are countries that have either strict laws against homosexuality or a strong social stigma. For Murhpy-Stevens, these are some of the most important places to reach. “Sport actually does cross over into a human rights event, and Gay Games is exactly doing that,” he says. “It’s a huge human rights event that we’ve wrapped in sport.”   gay games explainer    Even in countries with strong LGBT protections, many gay athletes feel disenfranchised. Gugulethu Makhubela, a soccer player from South Africa, attended this year’s games on a scholarship. While gay and lesbian rights are guaranteed under the South African constitution, social discrimination and attacks are still common.  Makhubela faces many of these challenges at home in Soweto, one the large, underserved black townships formed during apartheid. She grew up playing soccer on dusty fields, often playing with the larger and more aggressive boys’ teams. She played for a handful of local and regional teams before joining the Chosen Few, a team that’s part of an LGBT activism group. “I didn’t even know there were these groups for women, for lesbians,” she says. Through the chosen few she has travelled the country and, through the Gay Games, has got one step closer to her dream of playing soccer internationally.  For other international participants, anti-LGBT attitudes in their home country force them to hide their involvement with the games. Murphy-Stevens remembers receiving an email from a previous scholarship recipient, an Indian competitor who had been to the Chicago Gay Games in 2006. “He wrote me and said, ‘Please, remove my name from the press release, and from the sports results and all articles with me’,” says Murphy-Stevens. Two years after attending the games, the scholarship recipient was fired for being gay. “Someone emailed his boss or sent his boss a Google search and showed him that he had been at the Gay Games. And he lost his job.” Organizers complied by replacing his last name with an initial. Even in western countries, including the United States, intolerance remains an issue. Only 48 states have athletes competing, with no participants hailing from North Dakota or Wyoming. One issue, says Murphy-Stevens, is there’s a lack of knowledge. “There are runners there, but they don’t know anything about Frontrunners, or the International Gay and Lesbian Dance Association,” he says. The other issue, of course, is stigma and fear of persecution.  Although discrimination persists, it’s hard not to notice the recent shift in the sports community. Less that a decade ago it was rare for an athlete to declare their sexuality, but it recent years more professional athletes have come out – and, notably, continued competing. Matthew Mitcham was the only openly gay male athlete at the 2008 Olympics (of 11 openly gay athletes overall). Robbie Rogers was only the second professional male soccer player in the UK to come out as gay when he made the announcement in 2013, and he became the first openly gay professional athlete playing in North American sports when he started with the Los Angeles Galaxy. Since then: Jason Collins in the NBA, Brittney Griner in the WNBA, Michael Sam in the NFL.     Konstantin Yablotskiy of Russia, right, skates with Georg Kling of Switzerland at Gay Games 9. Photograph: Skyler Reid for the Guardian     At the opening ceremony, a pre-recorded video message from President Obama was played from the arena screens. “It’s been amazing to see the games thrive over the years.” he says. “We’ve come a long way in our commitment to the equal rights of LGBT people here and around the world.”  This increased acceptance has been visible throughout Cleveland and Akron throughout the week, despite some initial concerns about hosting the games in a smaller, more conservative location that in previous years. Thousand of people flocked to the Festival Village in Cleveland, residents and visitors alike. Dave Fisher, an Akron resident, spent much of the week visiting the Gay Games’ locations in his city. Fisher was one of a few hundred Christians who organized to pass out pink plastic wristbands that read “God likes me.”  “Recently the church has made homosexuality the No1 sin,” Fisher said. “But that’s not what God says.” While Fisher acknowledged that several churches refused to participate in the outreach, he still said that most of the community strongly supported the games.  For Yablotskiy, the games are no longer just about sport: “This international gay sports movement is a tool for empowering the community to be stronger, to be together, to be united and to keep going.” But he acknowledges that’s his perspective as the leader of an LGBT organization. He’s also experienced first hand the personal changes games can bring about: at a ceremony in New York on 8 August, the day before the Gay Games began, he got married. “These games are changing the world,” he says. “These games changed my world four years ago.”   Open contributions: Celebrating gay pride around the world – share your photos  ",2014-08-16T16:39:01Z,'It's a huge human rights event.

"The idea that LGBT inclusion is a non-issue, something that doesn't need to be dealt with, is widespread within business. Many are the leaders who stick their heads in the sand, ignoring the matter altogether and consequently harming the trust, growth and reputation of their business.Every day we hear of homophobic abuse in the workplace, cementing the mistrust in business support for LGBT people. This week Californian lesbian councillor Jovanka Beckles was called ""filth"" during a council meeting, only to be told she had herself to blame. Here in the UK, Lib Dem councillor Sam Phripp left his position after experiencing homophobic bullying from fellow politicians.I wish we lived in a world where being L, G, B or T was a non-issue but unfortunately we're not quite there yet, and until we are silence is the last thing we need. Positive action is required to combat these issues, not just from dedicated lobby groups but from employers.Here are a few tips that can help achieve just that.1. Basic human rightsSome things are obvious: don't be ignorant, don't be hateful, don't discriminate and don't simply tolerate; be inclusive and show respect. These rules apply to all humans and yet they seem to be forgotten all too often.2. Send the message from the top: put diversity on the agendaBeing inclusive means more than just obeying the law, it means making clear diversity is encouraged and that differences are celebrated. Assuming people know your stance on LGBT matters isn't enough, so make sure to eliminate any doubts regarding your support from the top.3. Make a stand – even if you think you are the first to do soBe brave. Being the first within a sector or community to stand up for equality can seem daunting but will pay off. Even if you believe no one is openly gay in your organisation, reassuring everyone that they would be accepted as part of the company is crucial to current and future workforces.4. Recognise LGBTQAI: lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex and alliesYes, there are lots of letters to bear in mind and you might not come across every colour of the rainbow flag in your company, but reading up on what they stand for, and recognising their importance to both you and your staff, is a basic step that you need to take.5. Be sensitive to multiple discriminationGender, sexuality, physical ability, class and skin colour are all still factors that can hold people back; combine any two or more and a person is likely to face double discrimination at some point. A good leader recognises the multiple combinations of discrimination possible and makes sure none of these factors prevents an employee from advancing in the business.6. Promote straight alliesStraight allies of LGBT people can be a powerful tool in the pursuit of inclusivity. A global support network of allies enables individuals to join in without actually coming out; this can be particularly useful in less inclusive countries.7. Promote role modelsEncourage senior LGBT people to come out and support emerging talent. The lack of out LGBT role models in business means that many begin their careers by reverting back into the closet.8. Support the T in LGBTThe T stands for transgender and often has nothing to do with sexuality, yet surprisingly many think it does. Transgender people are a minority within a minority and all too often face invasive questions, rumours and discrimination, not to mention being overlooked in business. Support of transgender people is vital.9. Challenge preconceptionsRelying on preconceptions for understanding can come across as being ignorant. Look beyond the stereotypes and see the person.10. Influence societyBusinesses have the power to shape society. Support local LGBT groups; consider volunteering and set up networking events; send the message that you care. As your company's legacy spreads, so does a culture of acceptance.11. Communicate inclusionGender neutral language can be helpful when you don't know someone. Try not to ask your colleague if she has a boyfriend; ask about her partner and go even further by offering Mx as an alternative to Mr/Mrs/Ms. Know what's offensive and challenge homophobic language everywhere.13. Don't be afraid to askBut remember how much you appreciate questions about your genitals and sex life.14. Support before travelRemember that other countries may be less supportive of LGBT people. Bring this up with employees before sending them abroad and show them that you take their safety and wellbeing seriously. Don't back down on values abroad and support diversity across your operations.15. Money talksWhy did Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe wait so long to come out? Because he thought his sponsors would walk away. That, if anything, is a sign of business impact on LGBT visibility worldwide.16. Respect the coming out processBear in mind that it can take a long time to build up the courage to come out, and that LGBT people don't just do it once – they do it to almost every person they meet.17. Revamp recruitmentRemove the cookie-cutter from your recruitment process. Stop placing people in boxes and appreciate their diversity.18. The hands-on stuffEnsure training outlines regulations and tackles homophobic bullying. Do consider offering adoption assistance and parental leave for both partners in addition to existing company policies. Include bereavement leave as well as transgender specific medical coverage for all. Install gender-neutral toilets.19. Follow it upTrack your progress and outline why it is important. You may not see results today but they will come, with time and with your support – and we thank you for it.20.

"The UK advertising industry is to get its first lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender leadership group, PrideAM, whose founders include the chair of Stonewall. The group, which stands for Pride in Advertising &amp; Marketing, has been set up following a survey by ad industry body the MAA which found that just one-third of LGBT staff at its member agencies feel comfortable coming out at work. “If people in marketing are going to be equipped to help change the attitudes and behaviour of society with regard to LGBT consumers then they need to get own house in order,” said co-founder Jan Gooding, group brand director at Aviva and chair of lobbying group Stonewall.  “This new group is a brilliant step forward and I am quite sure it will make a difference to a lot of people who are looking for signs that this issue is taken seriously and we truly want to change our culture at work.” The co-founders include Nick Bailey, the chief executive of digital network Isobar, Matt Scarff, the director of ITV Creative, and Scott Knox, the managing director of the Marketing Agencies Association. “While positive progress has been made in our industry we still have a long way to go,” said Bailey.  PrideAM will use the strapline “doing different” to sum up its ethos. The group will be officially launched at the president’s dinner of WACL, the body that has championed women executives in ad land and inspired the creation of PrideAM, later this month. “PrideAM has been created out of pressing need for a high profile group that celebrates and represents the still marginalised LGBT community in advertising, much like WACL celebrates women in advertising,” said Knox, who will be the group’s first president. The Institute of Practitioners in Advertising, which represents the vast majority of the UK’s ad agencies, does not have any similar initiative or group. It publishes an annual “census” of UK ad agency staff but it only covers age, ethnicity, gender and occupation.

"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, has called for an end to the ""shameful"" criminalisation of homosexuality in four out of five Commonwealth countries ahead of the Games due to start in Glasgow this week.The senior MP said it was not right that there might be world-class athletes who will not be able to compete in the Commonwealth Games, as they will have been discriminated against on the basis of their sexuality.Speaking on the eve of  Wednesday's  opening ceremony, in a challenge to the UK government and other countries to act, he said: ""Shamefully, it is estimated that 4 out of every 5 countries in the Commonwealth criminalise homosexuality. Surely, it is time for the Commonwealth to do more to support lesbian, gay, transsexual and bisexual people, to ensure they are not discriminated against, no matter where they live?""Bercow, who will attend the Games, said it was a ""fantastic sporting occasion"" and ""wonderful opportunity to celebrate the spirit of the Commonwealth"", but suggested the event has been overshadowed by the grouping's poor record on LBGT rights.David Cameron and Alex Salmond have  come under increasing pressure to speak out about the issue, after campaign groups highlighted the fact that 42 out of 53 countries in the Commonwealth criminalise homosexualityEarlier, Peter Tatchell, the equal rights campaigner, urged Salmond to ""appeal to all participating countries to adhere to Article 7 of the Commonwealth Games Federation constitution, which prohibits all discrimination"".Tatchell said: ""Countries that refuse to support Article 7 – or that perpetuate discrimination in access to sports facilities, training camps or team selection – should be barred from participating in the Commonwealth Games. If they are not prepared to abide by Article 7 they have no right to come to Glasgow or future Commonwealth Games.""The intensity of homophobia in these countries is so great that it is very unlikely that they would select a LGBTI athlete to compete in Glasgow. I can't imagine homophobic states like Uganda, Brunei or Nigeria selecting a LGBTI athlete. They are more likely to jail them than send them to Glasgow.""In addition, there is widespread gender and ethnic discrimination in many Commonwealth countries, which also inhibits equal, open and fair selection for the national teams coming to Glasgow.""Asked about the issue, Salmond told an audience of international media representatives that the country demonstrated its commitment to equal rights and non-discrimination at the Pride Glasgow events over the course of the Games.""In St Andrew's House, we fly the rainbow flag, sometimes called the pride flag internationally, for the course of the Games,"" he said. ""So, we demonstrate our commitment and we provide an exemplar in terms of what we believe in.""That's what I think is the best way to state our commitment, it's by what we do and how we act and what we display and what we advocate.""Chancellor George Osborne also spoke to business representatives in Glasgow on Tuesday but did not mention the issue of discrimination in Commonwealth countries. He made a plea for Scotland and the rest of the UK to stay together in order to prosper.",2014-07-22T15:41:16Z,"Commonwealth countries must support gay rights, urges Speaker John Bercow",,57,"<p>MP suggested that the Games had been overshadowed by poor LBGT rights record, despite being a fantastic sporting occasion</p>",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/22/1406043240585/John-Bercow-003.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jul/22/commonwealth-countries-support-gay-rights-lgbt-john-bercow,5
"The restrictive laws being imposed on NGOs, human rights organisations and campaign groups across the world hint at a rising tide of authoritarianism (Report, 27 August). This also raises serious concerns about the protection of free speech and expression. And for LGBT communities in the 78 jurisdictions worldwide that still criminalise homosexuality, this crackdown may be a case of life or death. In Uganda, the NGO bill, due to be debated next month in parliament, will make NGOs advocating for LGBT rights illegal, including the organisation I run. If the bill becomes law it would severely weaken the capacity of NGOs to fight for human rights to be upheld and will likely pave the way worldwide for governments to introduce even more oppressive laws.

"Advertising reflects society. More often than not, it presents an image built on traditional views of sexuality, gender identity and gender roles. However, in recent years, brands have been presenting a more diverse world view. The ads below are some of the best examples of LGBT representations from the industry. Some went viral, others prompted bomb threats. But what unifies them is a commitment to highlight LGBT people and challenge traditional thinking. 1. Ikea: Dining Room Table (1994)         Ikea’s groundbreaking 90s ad featuring a gay couple buying a dining table.    In 1994, Ikea became the first brand to feature a gay couple in a national TV ad. This itself is a landmark, but what really makes the ad stand out is how casually the relationship is depicted. There’s no shock factor or camp stereotyping (which would have been easy for an interior design company) but just an honest depiction of two guys buying a table. The recent wave of gay couples in adverts, especially in the US, can be traced back to this Ikea spot. However, the LGBT community is not uniquely made up of white, middle-class men. This is why the next three campaigns are noteworthy. 2. Barneys New York: Brothers, Sisters, Sons &amp; Daughters (2014)         An excerpt from Barneys New York spring 2014 campaign, directed by Bruce Weber.    Fashion brands are increasingly diversifying the models they use. Upscale department store Barneys New York set itself apart with its spring 2014 campaign that featured 17 transgender models. Not only did it provide the models with a platform to tell their stories and challenge preconceived notions and stereotypes, the retailer also donated 10% of one day’s profits to two LGBT charities. 3. Google: City Gym (2015)         The story of Jacob and City Gym.    Transgender issues have become a cultural talking point in a way that we haven’t seen before. This deeply powerful film from Google tells the story of Jacob and the gym that helped him during his transition. It deals with the subject matter in a frank and honest way and never feels exploitative. 4. Smirnoff: Voguing (2015)         Smirnoff’s campaign celebrates the LGBT subculture of Voguing.    Our film for Smirnoff celebrates the LGBT subculture of Voguing – an artform whose very essence deconstructs traditional notions of gender and sexuality. The vibrancy and openness of this community is a perfect match for the brand. Also important is its diverse representation of LGBT people at the cutting edge of contemporary culture. 5. Anouk: Bold is Beautiful (2015)          The Anouk ad sparked a debate on equality in India.    In a country where homosexuality remains illegal, the importance of this Indian ad cannot be overplayed (although its creative execution is questionable). This is India’s version of the Ikea ad above – an important leap forward, though a very safe one. Within days of its release, the ad went viral and sparked debate on equality in India. 6. Stonewall: Some people are gay. Get over it! (2009)     Stonewall’s ad campaign is a modern classic. Photograph: Stonewall    A modern classic – bold, simple and iconic. It states an obvious human fact that verges on the banal, which is why it works so well. Gay people are not a deviant, marginalised ‘other’ – they’re unremarkable, ordinary humans just like everyone else. Get over it. There we are: six ads that have broken stereotypes, challenged traditional thinking and helped drive LGBT awareness in mainstream culture. It’s no coincidence over half were produced in the past few years. Advertising themes typically lag behind TV and film, and LGBT representation is no different.

"While transgender people are having a moment in the media – which gives us opportunities to educate the public about our lives, as Laverne Cox and others have done – the reality is that trans people still face extreme rates of employment discrimination, social and economic marginalization, and violence.  It will take more than Laverne Cox’s image on the cover of TIME and critical acclaim for Transparent to change that. President Obama’s executive order last summer protecting transgender federal employees from anti-LGBT discrimination was a good start, especially as it resulted in Thursday’s ruling in favor of Tamara Lusardi, a transgender civilian US Army software specialist. The US office of special counsel decided that she was targeted with gender-identity discrimination by the Army when her co-workers required her to use a single-use, gender neutral restroom, referred to her as “sir”, “it” and by her birth name and refused to give her work. But we still have a long way to go to win employment protections for all trans people. While federal employees are protected in general, a huge loophole exists in that trans people are not allowed to serve openly in the military – so Lusardi can work for the Army, but she couldn’t serve in it unless she stayed in the closet ( a position in which many trans people find themselves).  And while some trans people (like myself) who are critical of a military that sends young, poor people from the US oversees to kill and die are speaking out against the push for inclusive military service – we think that our energies should be focused on protections for poor trans civilians – advocates for open service argue that acceptance could have a broader social impact, just like the racial desegregation of the US military did. Still, even advocates for open service are aware that the relationship between the military and trans people is more disturbing than just whether we’re allowed to serve. The death in the Philippines of Jennifer Laude, a trans woman in whose killing a Marine, Pfc Joseph Scott Pemberton, has been charged, is a heartbreaking reminder of the high rate of violence faced by trans women of color. That the US turned Pemberton over to the Philippines authorities – and that Secretary of State John Kerry has stated that the US will seek no special privileges for Pemberton – sends a strong signal that the US military and government will not condone targeted anti-trans violence, but is still small comfort.  Ideally, policy changes for federal employees – and perhaps even for military personnel – would have a ripple effect, helping obtain employment protections on the federal level for trans people who are not employed by the federal government. Until then, though, 32 states have no protections for employment-based gender-identity discrimination, and there is no federal law protecting non-federal employees. The current version of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (which has no chance of passing in this political climate) is a weakened piece of legislation with limited scope that also includes a massive religious exemption. And, after the US supreme court ruling in Hobby Lobby, it’s clear that any nebulous religious exemption can be used by a variety of employers as a license to discriminate. We need real protections for trans people in all states – and not just for those who are already employed, either. Trans people are often discriminated against in the hiring process and thereby face high rates of unemployment. We also still lack protections against discrimination in housing, public accommodations, education and many federal programs. One-off executive orders, which naturally have limited scope, cannot be an excuse to ignore the urgency with which so many trans people need the protections from discrimination many other men and women take for granted.  Lusardi’s case is an important first step in combatting anti-trans workplace discrimination at the federal level, but right now it is only that. We have to use the momentum and media attention from this win and the media’s current interest in trans celebrities to push for the basic rights all trans people need before the spotlight fades.",2014-10-23T18:22:17Z,Trans people need more than beloved celebrity spokespeople.

"As you might expect of a Stockholm suburb on a Sunday, not very much is happening in Gärdet. Despite its staunchly liberal values Sweden is a Christian country, and the shops and cafés near the station are almost aggressively shut. Aside from one elderly man puffing on a pipe, the streets are empty. An expanse of identikit 80s apartment block screams “Nordic noir” but doesn’t so much as whisper “gay”. Certainly there is nothing to suggest that this is the setting of Europe’s first LGBT retirement community. “People want security in old age,” says Christer Fällman, 55, the chairman and youngest resident of the Regnbågen (rainbow) housing project. “They want closeness to other people, and not to be so lonely.” The warmth and liveliness in the common room of the Regnbågen block is certainly a contrast to the reserved scene outside. In spite of being immaculately clean, it feels lived in. The white walls are dotted with paintings and, in one corner, a rainbow-coloured kite stands as a small “here be gays” reminder. Before Regnbågen opened, the demand for LGBT senior housing had already been recognised outside Europe, with homes existing in the US, Canada and Australia. A gay retirement village is due to open in Sallèles-d’Aude, in the south of France, next spring, and it seems likely that other European nations will follow suit. What lies behind this surge in accommodation for elderly LGBT people? Studies have shown that retirement home residents are reluctant to open up about their sexuality. A report by Stonewall showed that older gay and bisexual people in the UK are much more likely than their hetero counterparts to live alone and to lack family support. The charity found that older gay men are three times more likely to be single than straight men, and that 41% of elderly LGBT people live alone. Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK, said that there is cause for concern over mistreatment of older LGBT people in the care system. “We are worried about a hidden minority of residents who may be experiencing homophobic care,” she says. “Our concern is that some older people will feel they have to hide who they are because they are scared of how people will react.” In the Regnbågen common room, Fällman sips coffee and explains how this wonderful anomaly of a community came to be. The idea came to him in 2009, at a conference on care for the elderly held during Stockholm Pride. With no money and a fairly utopian vision, Fällman set about building a great concrete nest for elderly gay Swedes. Through his background in social care and links to Stockholm council, he found funding and the project gathered momentum. Regnbågen finally opened in November last year and now has around 100 residents from all over Sweden and even other European countries. Residents are, on average, in their mid- to late 60s, but the oldest are in their 80s. Each has a private apartment, along with use of a common room and roof terrace. The community has attracted so much interest that there is a waiting list of 60. The home has even started a trend. The city council is now receiving requests from elderly firemen and policemen for their own dedicated housing communities.     A place to call home: Regnbågen founder Christer Fällman, 55, is also its youngest resident. Photograph: Johanna Frenkel for the Observer.    But why are older LGBT people so keen to surround themselves with fellow non-straights? “People our age are a little afraid to get back in the closet,” says Björn Lundstedt, 73. Lundstedt, a former commercial pilot, says he is reluctant to assimilate with the predominantly heterosexual lifestyle expected of people from his generation. Like many other Regnbågen residents, he was born in the 40s, when homosexuality was illegal in Sweden. Although gay sex was legalised by the Swedish government in 1944 (23 years before the UK followed suit), homosexuality remained classified as a mental illness until the late 70s. It’s understandable that having lived through so much discrimination, gay people of Lundstedt’s age are wary of entering a care system largely inhabited by old heterosexuals. But, in the open-minded Sweden of 2014, is homophobia still a common problem for the elderly? Lars Mononen, 64, seems to think not. For him, LGBT elderly care is more about a sense of community and belonging than escaping bigotry. “Sweden is a very inclusive and tolerant society,” says Mononen. “It’s about sharing common values and understanding each other’s backgrounds.” Mononen speaks with a nervous energy and has an Alec Baldwin-esque glint in his blue eyes. “I’m not entirely sure if that’s true,” interjects Björn Gate, 72. Gate, bearded and thoughtful, speaks about an “invisible discrimination” that pervades even this most liberal of nations. According to Gate, homosexuality is often accepted but not understood. And, as is the case for many elderly people in care, to be surrounded by those who tolerate you but find your sexuality eccentric at best, abnormal at worst, must be an isolating experience. The same is true of those from religious or ethnic minorities, argues Gate. When these people reach old age, they’re in danger of losing their culture and identity to assimilation. Cultural isolation is something that many Regnbågen inhabitants have known. Most residents, Fällman explains, grew up with a sense of shame. He was brought up in a small town about 600km north of Stockholm. As a teenager, he dreamed of becoming a figure skater. “But I wasn’t allowed. That was for girls.” When his parents discovered that he was gay, they took him to a doctor. “They wanted to heal me,” he says. Lundstedt’s experience of coming out was similarly gruelling. He was 20, and although his mother (who claimed she had known all along) said that she would love him no matter what, his father sought medical attention for his “condition”. One doctor’s words are permanently etched onto Lundstedt’s memory. “He said, ‘If you can’t do what your parents want, isn’t it better to castrate yourself?’” Thankfully, his father was intelligent enough to ignore that advice. But he still couldn’t accept that his son was gay. “I never got the love that I wanted from my father,” he says. When he came out to his younger brother it was a different story. “He has always been there for me,” says Lundstedt. Remembering their past is clearly vital to particular Regnbågen residents. “We have an important job to do,” says Fällman, “to reach out to young people and tell them about our history.” The community welcomes visits from schools and universities, and some members are keen to share their stories. In taking on this responsibility, the collective is setting itself up as a sort of living museum of gay history. The stories aren’t all sad. Gate explains that while he was bullied a little at school, he never faced prejudice from those closest to him. He came out to his mother when he was about 18. A few weeks later, he was approached by his father. “He patted me on the shoulder and said, ‘Let’s go for a walk, Björn.’” Gate says that his father, although he didn’t truly understand his sexuality, supported him. “He said: ‘The only thing I understand is that I’m always behind you and I will always love you, and I’m proud of you as my son.’” Gate recognises that, even today, many young people’s experiences of coming out aren’t as easy as his was, more than 50 years ago. Similarly, Mononen’s family never had trouble accepting his sexuality. As a young man, he had boyfriends. “Then I met a girl,” he says, “And she…” “Hooked you,” Fällman cuts in. Both men laugh. So for 12 years, Mononen was happily married to a woman. They had three children and he worked for Volvo. In many ways, he did the “typical Swedish man” thing for a bit. Is he bisexual? Perhaps. But he’s only interested in men for now. Whichever way, his brothers and sisters are behind him. Personal histories aside, what is life like at Regnbågen? “People who have moved here say: ‘Finally, I’m at home,’” says Monomen. The room resounds with agreement. Although around 70% of the residents are men, backgrounds and sexualities are mixed. Fällman says that it was always his aim for those on average pensions to be able to afford the rent. There are only a handful of couples, and so far no romantic relationships have formed. But there is plenty of flirting. “If you walk the corridors at night, you will see a lot of exciting things,” jokes Mononen. On Saturday mornings, residents gather for coffee in the common room. One of the women has started a knitting circle. In many ways, Regnbågen is a typical retirement community. While most of the women in the complex chose not to speak to me, I did have an email conversation with one of them, who preferred not to be named. She told me that before moving into Regnbågen, she was very quiet about her sexuality. She joined the community in an effort to “restart” her life – a brave step at 69. “We are from different walks of life,” she says. “Coming to Regnbågen has brought us together.”",2014-07-27T08:00:08Z,LGBT retirement home: the end of the rainbow,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-e9835198-30e0-4a9c-927a-25632c92633d""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/23/1406110264242/residents-in-the-common-r-011.jpg"" alt=""residents in the common room"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">‘People our age are a little afraid to get back in the closet’: residents gather for coffee in the common room.

"One tiny country has been blazing a liberal trail across Latin America. In the past six years, Uruguay has introduced ground-breaking legislation on abortion, drugs, transsexual rights, and same-sex marriage and adoption.While President José ""Pepe"" Mujica and his centre-left Broad Front coalition have been making international headlines for their sweeping reforms – which led to Uruguay being crowned country of the year by the Economist magazine in 2013 – less well known is that up to 3,000 civil society activists have been the driving force behind the country's extreme makeover.""Just 10 years ago, these laws would have been unthinkable,"" Michelle Suárez, a member of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) group Ovejas Negras, or Black Sheep, said when the legislation was passed. Suárez, the country's first transgender law graduate, drafted the proposal for the equal marriage bill passed by parliament last year and worked on legislation that granted equal adoption rights to same-sex couples in 2009.When Broad Front won the election in 2004, its manifesto showed little sign of such an approach. ""This [liberal] agenda has been conceived by social movements systematically alienated from political power,"" says Lilian Celiberti, a teacher and member of Cotidiano Mujer, which campaigns for gender equality.In recent decades, there has been a more collaborative approach to social activism in Uruguay. Formerly disparate organisations representing women, young people, students and LGBT citizens have been joining forces to reach a wider audience and gain political influence.""Until the 1990s, [LGBT] groups' concerns were limited to discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity,"" Diego Sempol, a history professor and member of Ovejas Negras, says. ""But people are not only excluded for being gay, lesbian or trans, but for being an unemployed gay [person], a black lesbian or a poor trans woman.""The gay pride parade of the 1990s, which attracted about 300 people, evolved into the diversity march in 2005, which focused on a range of issues affecting minority and marginalised groups. Last year, it was attended by an estimated 30,000 people, and ""is now an event nobody wants to miss"", says Celiberti.According to the sociologist Diego Pieri, rights groups were keen to collaborate ""once they were able to identify our common enemy: conservative Uruguay and its hypocritical, intolerant structures"".However, some causes have achieved success more quickly than others. Since 1985, there have been seven bills intended to decriminalise abortion, including a law passed in 2008, but vetoed shortly after by the president at the time, Tabaré Vázquez, even though his Broad Front party had initially championed the initiative.The separation of church and state in Uruguay took place as early as 1917, meaning that religious values have, perhaps, had less influence on politics in the predominantly Catholic country than in other parts of Latin America.When Mujica came to office in 2010, he promised he would not exercise his right to veto the abortion reforms, despite opposition from religious campaigners. The legislation was finally signed into law in 2012.Celiberti believes Uruguay's male-dominated political system contributed to the legal delays. ""Decisions over women's bodies touch the essence of patriarchy, which is imprinted on the whole political spectrum,"" she says.Not all liberal reforms took as long to implement as the abortion act, however. The introduction of a state-regulated market for cannabis was more swiftly approved to make Uruguay the first country in the world to make it legal to grow, sell and consume marijuana.Activist groups such as Proderechos, or Pro-Rights, played a major role in the country's overhaul of its drug policies. In the five years leading up to the reforms, youth, feminist and student organisations teamed up with health experts and NGOs to push the drugs debate to the top of the political agenda. Outdoor events were held, attracting thousands of people, to show that even a lot of people smoking marijuana together entailed no risks.Despite the campaigns, few expected the president to make such radical changes to the country's drug laws. ""He definitely took us by surprise,"" says Pieri. ""Mujica's courage was remarkable.""Decades of persistent and collaborative campaigning by rights groups have paved the way for Uruguay to become a more open, integrated and tolerant society, but, say activists, there is no room for complacency. Much more needs to be done to achieve equality, particularly in rural communities. ""If two boys kiss each other in some of Montevideo's suburbs or in the countryside, they could still be at serious risk of physical violence,"" Sempol says.",2014-08-01T11:43:02Z,"The LGBT, feminist and student voices behind Uruguay's radical reforms",,62,"From legalising abortion to transsexual rights, marginalised groups have united to become a formidable force for change. <strong>Diana Cariboni </strong>reports",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2014/7/31/1406803436050/People-dance-and-cheer-du-004.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/aug/01/uruguay-lgbt-feminist-student-protest-liberal-reforms,5
"Ahead of the International day against homophobia and transphobia on 17 May, we asked our readers what it&apos;s like to be LGBT in their country.  More than 100 submissions were sent via GuardianWitness from all over the world. From Japan to Russia and Germany to Bangladesh, here are some of the stories we received.  Bangladesh A country where the predominant religions say you are a sinner, the law of the land says you are a criminal, the social norms say you are a pervert, the culture considers you as imported; how should life be for LGBTs in Bangladesh? I call it living in a &apos;comfortable closet&apos;. Comfortable because it is actually &apos;easy&apos; when it comes &apos;doing it&apos;; the culture and social norms are so focused on preventing heterosexual acts between unmarried couples that man-to-man or woman-to-woman sexual acts go almost unnoticed. Even in some more conservative regions homosexual act between teenage boys is seen as the &apos;safer&apos; way of exploring sexuality; so long they get married at their adulthood, no one cares much. But it&apos;s a closet! The moment someone decides to leave that they&apos;ll face &apos;death&apos;, they fear. When the country&apos;s first magazine on lgbt issues, Roopbaan, was published, so harsh was the reaction from the majority.  When a group organised a rainbow rally on the first day of Bengali New Year as part of the bigger New Year&apos;s rally, it was highly applauded by the crowd as no LGBT banner or label was used. But the moment an online news portal tagged this as &apos;pride rally by homosexuals&apos; and Roopbaan as its organiser, the public reaction went brutal. But things are changing; very slowly but steadily. Amidst that darkness of hatred and threats there&apos;s a silver lining like support from various human rights groups and individuals. Online activism among the LGBT community is rising sharply with a steady offline/community movement by organisations like the Bandhu Social Welfare Society and Boys of Bangladesh. The government has very recently recognised &apos;hijras&apos; as a new gender. In a country where the whole concept of sex and sexuality is a taboo, we are learning to navigate our ways by highlighting &apos;love&apos; as the center of all, as a human right that can&apos;t be denied, hoping for better, and may be &apos;faster&apos;, acceptance.. some day! Xulhaz Mannan Germany     Attendants cheer during the opening ceremonies of the Gay Games on 31 July 2010 in Cologne, Germany. Photograph: JOERG CARSTENSEN/EPA    Penal code § 175, outlawing gay sex, was of course abolished decades ago, we have openly gay foreign ministers and other openly lesbian and gay politicians - and it&apos;s been legal now to &quot;marry&quot; your partner by committing to a civil union (without some rights like the right to adoption as a couple etc.). But recent homophobic attacks against Baden-Württemberg&apos;s proposed new school curriculum that includes the teaching of sexual diversity shows there&apos;s lots of resentment under the surface. Of course, compared to having to fear for one&apos;s personal safety on a daily basis, things in Germany are pretty good. Nonetheless I find it annoying to have people take for granted that I have a husband just because I&apos;m a woman. And it&apos;s not just annoying but sad that in smaller German towns, gays and lesbians are practically invisible and are too afraid to be recognised by neighbours or bosses to join a gay parade, if there is one in the first place. I feel it is altogether tragic and shocking to hear, after having moved to a different town, that a young lesbian acquaintance of mine -- one of those who did not join the parade -- has committed suicide. So, on the surface lots of rainbow colours, but it&apos;s still pretty dark underneath. LydiaStiefzeh Japan     Drag queens at the Tokyo Lesbian and Gay Parade 2001. Photograph: ITSUO INOUYE/AP    Growing up in liberal, multi-cultural central Manchester, coming out barely raised an eyebrow. Naively, when I moved to Japan to live near Osaka, I assumed it would be equally tolerant, if not as open. After all, Japan was open to all kinds of subcultures right? All my Japanese friends and students had been utterly blase as well when I told them, which I took as indicative of general opinions. It was in our welcoming seminars when the Japan Stonewall representative warned us that coming out to our offices could potentially result in immediate termination of our contracts as their is no anti-discrimination legislation that it began to dawn on me that maybe it was going to be all rainbows and sakura from here on in. In Japan, attitudes vary depending on location. In metropolitan and international Kansai the response is usually one of surprise and shock, rather than outright hostility; friends living in the 田舎 (inaka, countryside or the sticks), have been far less lucky. A strong streak of social conservatism runs through Japan. The major opposition to homosexuality (and lesbians in particular) is not so much that it is seen as `wrong` or `sinful` - Japan is a very secular country as a general rule- and more that it is just `different`. The overwhelming assumption of my female students (and male ones to a lesser degree) is that they will marry, have children, give up work to be a 主婦 (shufu, housewife) etc, etc. Any lifestyle which shows potential deviation from that strict model is frowned upon- and no-one considers that gay people may aspire to this very model of matrimony and normalacy. I am comparatively lucky as there are two (TWO!) lesbian bars in the whole of Osaka, and another couple in Kyoto about an hour away. They are small, poky places with no identifying marks. The majority of Japanese queer women I have met are very firmly closeted, only one or two coming out to family members who respond with disapproval although not usually outight rejection. Another difference is that Japanese queer women clearly define themselves as `boi`s` or `femmes`, and partner up accordingly. If you don`t clearly delineate, like myself, you are met with bemusement. Gendered roles are still pretty reinforced on the LGBT scene. Its not all doom and gloom though. Although gay `scenes` tend to be limited just to Osaka and Tokyo, the local clientele are always welcoing. Queer foreigners also tend to band together and lots of events are organised through Stonewall Japan and others. I came out at my office and although people were surprised (`but you have long hair!`), they adjusted pretty quickly. I&apos;ve had responses from students, friends and colleagues ranging from `here, we think its a disease` (in a very helpful informative tone!) to `so what, its 2014`, Most of the stigma is bound up with rigid conceptions of gender roles, which is very gradually changing. Overall, Japan sees itself as a welcoming and kind society, so even if people are more embarassed than supportive, you are very unlikely to face any overt discrimination (well, that would be rude...). Also, of all the shiniest of silver linings, there is the Takarazuka Revue. Case closed. Lorna Petty UK     'The change in the UK since when I was a teenager being bullied on a daily basis due to my sexuality to where we stand today is incredible.' Photograph: andrewgrace89/GuardianWitness    Social attitudes have improved dramatically in the past decade, thanks to activism from the transgender community and growing understanding and acceptance from the younger generations; aided enormously by the web, and social media sites.  I am fortunate to live in country that has some legal protections for the transgender community especially, as harassment, violence and threatening behaviour are still all too common: with the hardest impact falling on those from poorer backgrounds and women from ethnic minorities in this country.  Casual social discrimination continues to set us back even when there is a measure of tolerance, and still closely impacts our careers and personal lives: everything from finding a flat, to finding and maintaining relationships. All the more when we exist at the intersection of socially marginalised groups.  Even with the privilege of my features and an excellent college education, I am caught on minimum wage, my degree shot to pieces dealing with mental health issues. My family is tolerant but not especially accepting, and I am fortunate even for that. I have met trans women who are thriving in spite of everything, but many who continue to struggle on multiple fronts, none of this helped by the current governments&apos; attitude to social support and benefits.  All this, and I live in London. The oppression transgender women, women of colour, face worldwide is shocking and heartbreaking.

Dumiso Gatsha submitted this video to GuardianWitness about the LGBT community in Botswana.    Northern Ireland I grew up in a very homophobic atmosphere in Northern Ireland, regular bullying, homophobic language and violence and no positive gay role models, gay life was hidden and not discussed. That was the 1980s. Although I now live in London, like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland has seen some amazing changes in 30 years which mean its much easier to be out, especially with family and friends. My experience is that day to day, and as individuals most Northern Irish people aren&apos;t homophobic anymore but it lags behind the rest of the UK in laws and the political culture is far from tolerant.  Like in other parts of the world affected by political homophobia there is a strong link to conservative religious groups and tribal politicians, who fight any positive move made for gay people as a way of motivating their core votes and followers.  Although living in London life is very free and beautiful I&apos;m always conscious of how just 500 miles away a very different less progressive culture still exists and that for any minority group, hard won freedoms are often easily reversed. Even in London we shouldn&apos;t think battles have been won forever. Johnpwray Mexico City     Gay couples celebrate as a mariachi band performs after getting married at a courthouse in Mexico City, Sunday, July 14, 2013. Photograph: Marco Ugarte/AP    I moved to Mexico City in November 2000 from Australia to live with my gay Mexican partner. It&apos;s been 14 years and I have never regretted a day. Mexico City is the capital of gay culture in Mexcio, attracting LGBT people from other parts of Mexico and Latin America. There is a generational problem that I have seen, regarding being &quot;out&quot;. Mexico City was a very conservative and homophobic place. This led to social and family pressure on gay men to establish a family, and therefore stay well and truly closeted. There are different bars in the city where older men meet and socialise in a gay setting. They then return to their wives and children. However, things have changed in many ways.  Although discrimination exists and violence is not unheard of, in Mexico City there seems to be less pull from the Catholic Church than other parts of Mexico. As a result, many people tend to be ambivalent about same sex or transgendered issues. They know what is going on but pretend that it doesn&apos;t exist. If there are gatherings of family, partners often attend. The partner, however, is introduced as a &apos;friend&apos;, but everyone knows that they are in a relationship. As in every society young people tend to be pushing the boundaries. Younger people just don&apos;t see it as a problem. There is still a very lively gay scene, but when you venture into different bars there are many places where everyone is mixing, and not even considering sexuality as an issue. One thing that has advanced life for LGBT people in Mexico City was the passing of laws to legalise gay marriage. Before the legislation was voted on, there was a mammoth struggle between the centre left local government and the catholic church. The law was important because it was the first time in Mexico that LGBT rights had been legally backed. There are still problems with Federal Government institutions accepting LGBT spouses, and Mexico City laws have had to be backed by the Supreme Court, but conservatives in Mexico have discovered that once a law is in place it is very hard to get rid of. One very strange thing for my partner and I is that we have not taken advantage of the laws, and remain unmarried. I would like to.

Photograph: Anatoly Medved/Demotix/Corbis    We, Russians, are a pretty cold and closed people. Showing affections in public is something considered inappropriate even for your old heterosexual couples. And introducing same-sex unions is really unimaginable in this realm of stagnated conservatism.  People are scared to come out for various reasons starting from fear not to be understood by their own families (and maybe even disowned by them) and ending with a well-grounded caution for their jobs. The only remedy here is to stay quiet and keep one’s own preferences to oneself. As even the “great and powerful” Russian language is likely turn against one as there is a wild range of insults based on abusing one’s sexuality. Actually calling someone gay is one of the easiest ways to show a person’s disregard and extreme contempt. At the same time it is not that LGBT don’t exist. The clubs are there even if it is difficult to get inside if you don’t know where exactly the door is. And there are proud gay people walking hand in hand even when suffering from the necessity of hiding in the closet and secretly planning an immigration to some more tolerant and happy place.  Actually in this land of thriving inequality it is still relatively easy to exist if one is prepared to keep one’s mouth shut. And that is probably the key-point of the our most infamous “gay-propaganda” law. Shblsh What&apos;s it like being LGBT in your country?

"Following the publication of my book “The Glass Closet: Why Coming Out is Good Business”, I have been touched by the stories that LGBT men and women have shared on GlassCloset.org and on GuardianWitness. Real-life examples of both success and failure remind us of the progress we have made, and provide role models to whom others can aspire. They also offer examples of how to create a more inclusive environment for LGBT people in the workplace. Many of the stories suggest there is reason to be optimistic. Across professions from teaching to accounting, bringing yourself to work is not only tolerated, but increasingly celebrated. Guardian reader “starrynite” reached out to her headteacher ahead of her same-sex wedding, just in case parents and students reacted negatively to the news. “He assured me we had nothing to worry about and that if we experienced any negativity, the people involved should be directed straight to him,” she writes. The school later acknowledged her relationship in the school newsletter. Her story illustrates an important point: that the right tone from the top can help foster a true culture of inclusion. This applies to all sectors, including business. CEOs must broadcast their acceptance of difference and react strongly to any and all instances of discrimination. This encourages line managers to do the same, and gives people the confidence to come out. When they do come out, these employees are likely to see that far fewer people are bothered by the news than they anticipated. Guardian reader “ID8469280” underwent gender reassignment while working at a FTSE 100 company. She writes that around 50 colleagues sent supportive emails and that only one man objected (and then, only to HR). “No customers complained and, after [I left the company], some employed me on a freelance basis.” Another reader, “RichardAshby”, writes that after he was outed by a newspaper his career did not suffer. In fact, he ended up as the head of his department. It would be naïve to think that everyone will have similarly positive experiences. It is a fact of life that bigots work in all sectors, across all countries. At the same time, we must remember that these people are increasingly the exception to the rule. I sympathise deeply with people like “haterudepeople”, a lesbian who remains closeted at a not-for-profit in Australia. “I simply feel I would be quietly judged and provided less opportunity,” she writes. “I think about it almost daily and expect it may be more to do with my fear and judgment of others.” I remember feeling similar anxiety at various points in my own career. Looking back, I know that I underestimated the capacity of my own colleagues to accept all of me—including my sexual orientation. Most will not care and if they do, that is a burden for them to bear. As Sander van &apos;t Noordende, the Group Chief Executive of Accenture&apos;s Products operating group, writes on GlassCloset.org: &quot;It is their problem, not yours.&quot; Ultimately, a workplace is for work. You will be better at your job when you can be yourself. &quot;Coming out relieved me of the shame I had felt for so many years,&quot; writes Fabrice Houdart, an employee at the World Bank. &quot;Almost overnight I experienced a newfound self-confidence.&quot; If you face judgmental colleagues, remember the words of Guardian user “Rhodian Dawson”: “Regardless of who you are and what your sexual preferences are, it ultimately boils down to character, competence and trustworthiness.” To read more stories about coming out in the workplace visit GlassCloset.org and you can read more contributions on coming out at work on GuardianWitness.",2014-07-07T10:41:06Z,Coming out at work: Lord Browne reads your stories,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-1881d3d9-5a8f-4898-a5f9-9e68b1468f9d""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/7/1404726850385/3baf7696-6423-46cd-89d6-0bb8f4c0b484-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""lord browne smashing a glass window with a hammer"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Lord Browne: ‘While you think there is a 99% chance coming out will be fine, the consequences of that 1% are terrifying.’ Retouching: Annelie Pittlik.

"The founder of an online community for LGBT teenagers in Russia has been fined under the country’s law against gay propaganda.  Elena Klimova was fined 50,000 roubles (£540) after a court in Nizhny Tagil concluded that Deti-404, which has pages on Facebook and Russian social network VK, was guilty of distributing “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations among minors”. Klimova said she would appeal against the ruling. Kilmova successfully appealed against a fine levied by a court in the same town in January. With parents and teachers often unsympathetic or even hostile, Deti-404 (Children-404) is one of the few platforms for Russian teenagers to discuss LGBT issues in a safe space. Nearly every day, young people write in with stories and photographs – with their faces and names often hidden – describing the harassment, beatings and confusion they suffer due to their sexuality.  The group has recently come under attack by the authorities and pro-Kremlin activists. At the request of the local prosecutor general’s office, a court in St Petersburg in March found Deti-404 guilty of gay propaganda and ruled that its VK page should be blacklisted. The court said it would have the state communications watchdog block the page, but it has remained accessible. Klimova said she also intends to appeal against this ruling. Putin signed the law against gay propaganda in June 2013. Later that year, gay rights campaigner Nikolai Alexeyev and fellow activist Yaroslav Yevtushenko became the first people to be fined under the law after they stood outside a library in Arkhangelsk with banners that said: “Gay propaganda does not exist. People do not become gay, people are born gay.”  A newspaper editor in Khabarovsk was also fined under the law after he ran an article about gay rights activist Alexander Yermoshkin, who said he had been assaulted and forced to quit his job because of his sexuality.  Activists have said the legislation has resulted in increased harassment and violence against LGBT people, especially teenagers.    Related: Russian anti-gay law prompts rise in homophobic violence    “The law against gay propaganda legitimised violence against LGBT people, and they now are banning street actions under it,” Klimova said. “People are afraid because they understand that gay propaganda is banned, and even mentioning LGBT relations is essentially forbidden.” Klimova herself has been the subject of vituperative online commentary after creating Deti-404 in spring 2013. In April, she published a photo album on her social media page called “Beautiful People and What They Say to Me,” where she paired users’ profile pictures with threatening, expletive-laced messages they had sent her. “Go and fucking kill yourself before before they come for you,” wrote a woman pictured smiling with a bouquet of roses in her profile picture. “Gunning you down, you little bitch, is just the beginning of what you deserve,” wrote a man pictured alongside a baby goat.  Earlier this month, Yermoshkin left Russia following a state television broadcast that claimed to show US intelligence agents recruiting him to hold LGBT rallies in Russia. The activist said the conversation with the supposed intelligence agents was a setup and he cooperated out of concern for his safety.

"There may be up to 10,000 gay men in prison in England and Wales. Although a significant number of prisoners actively engage in consensual or coercive sexual relations with fellow prisoners, homophobia prevails. Officially the Prison Service has said that it “does not condone or facilitate sexual relationships between prisoners”, but every prison in the country has a “condom policy”, while staff generally follow the tacit “don’t ask, don’t tell” strategy. This ambiguity and hypocrisy means that insights about the reality of the prison experience for gay men and women in prison are hard to come by. When the Howard League for Penal Reform undertook an independent commission to review the nature and scale of sex in prison earlier this year, requests by researchers to speak to serving prisoners were blocked by the Ministry of Justice. Instead the evidence was provided by former prisoners. One gay man explained how he was forced to live under the “protection” of another prisoner and subjected to “sexual torture” over a prolonged period. “I’ve wanted to talk about it for a long time,” he told the researcher, “but the means were not there. Because nobody wants to know, nobody wants to hear about this horrendous, horrendous abuse.”     A prisoner’s drawing depicting his experience in jail.    Another had no complaints, telling the researcher that, “prison was a fabulous sexual experience.” “I’ve never had so much sex. I was very popular, and I loved it.” Others said they had sexual partners who were outwardly “macho” and “anti-gay” and were sustaining relationships with wives or girlfriends through letters and visits – these were “jail gays”, they said, “gay on the inside”, but apparently straight on the outside. The commission reveals that little has changed since my own time in prison from 1984 to 2004. As the years passed I became acutely aware of how painful, destructive and damaging the privation of opportunities for healthy sexual expression can be for prisoners. For five years I was a listener, trained by the Samaritans to offer a non-judgmental ear to fellow prisoners in distress. That’s when I learned how prevalent the suppression of sexual identity was in prison. Gay men ashamed of being gay, straight men feeling forced to pretend to be anti-gay. I saw transgender prisoners, already struggling to come to terms with their own complexities, left to the mercy of an exaggerated macho culture, trying to cope with being objects both of derision and desire. And through those 20 years inside, I never saw a single acknowledgment from the system that these were issues that urgently needed addressing. A unique and enlightening new book of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) prison experiences, written by prisoners and staff from HMP Parc in south Wales, may finally bring about change. The book, Inside and Out, was the idea of the prison’s arts intervention and community inclusion manager, Phil Forder, himself a gay man who “came out” at work five years ago. Forder has been running Parc’s monthly LGBT support group for more than two years. He brought in a creative writing teacher for a month, with amazing results, he says. “When the group read their pieces aloud at the end, you could feel the levels of trust building.” Forder, along with education and library staff, has been running a collaboration with the Hay Literary Festival for seven years, inviting authors into the prison. For this year’s Hay in the Parc, Forder invited the LGBT group to write about coming out. “I asked them to write their stories in the privacy of their cells and bring them to the group. It was incredibly moving to see how much similarity there was, and the support and understanding generated as a result was obvious. It seemed only natural then to extend the project to include staff.” The result was Inside and Out. Forder’s LGBT work in the prison has led to him being shortlisted from over 20,000 nominees for the positive role model award at this year’s National Diversity Awards.    Officially the Prison Service 'does not condone sexual relationships', but every prison has a 'condom policy'    His boss at the privately run Parc prison, director Janet Wallsgrove, expresses pride in what Forder and his colleagues have achieved. “This book is a statement,” she says. “It’s saying that we at Parc recognise and support everyone’s right to be respected as an individual. It’s both about tackling homophobia and challenging people who express views that are unacceptable and about getting people to feel comfortable with themselves and more motivated to buy into a rehabilitative culture in prison and in society.” In an era when good news stories about our prisons are rare, this courageous, pioneering book shines bright.  Anthony’s story Anthony, prisoner I always knew I was gay – even as a small boy – but I also knew that in the Traveller community this was totally not acceptable and was seen as a mental problem. As a result I never spoke to anyone about it for fear that they would get angry. Since I have come out there have been several attempts on my life by the Traveller community. I have been knifed in the hand (protecting my face), stabbed in the back, bottled over the head and hit by a car but, if anything, it has made me stronger. I used to think that being gay was wrong and felt ashamed of it, but I don’t anymore. I’ve been inside now for 14 months. When I came into prison I never said either way whether I was gay or not. I don’t look camp so could easily pass as straight. Also I have photos of my children on my cell wall, so why would anyone think differently? My partner visits me every week with his sister. My partner’s family have accepted me as one of theirs, so much so that I see them as my own family now. The only thing that does bother me in prison are the other Travellers. They tend to stick together in here as there is strength in numbers. The prison puts on regular events where my path crosses theirs, such as the Gypsy, Roma, Traveller support groups and Sunday mass. I still hold on to my Catholic faith. It means a lot to me. I’d been in here about a year before my past caught up with me. I was walking back to my wing and I passed B block. As I did someone shouted out from one of the cell windows: “Anthony, you fucking queer”. I couldn’t see who it was but everybody in the the houseblock must have heard it. I wasn’t frightened, but more angry than anything that someone had the cowardly cheek to shout something out about my personal life and judge me for it. They would never say it to my face. I went back to my cell and decided to put on a rainbow wristband I had been given by the equality team, which I’ve worn ever since. I’m fed up with having to hide and pretend. Although just a wristband, it is a big statement in here. A few people have raised their eyebrows but no regular prisoner has challenged me seriously. I guess I can hold my own on the wing. Trans in prison Linda, prisoner Before arriving here at Parc, it was like being on a motorway, only stuck in the slow lane, dragging along at a very slow pace, dodging scraps with others around me. It was not the sort of journey you would want to take. But it is your inner strength, self-belief and courage that keeps you getting up and carrying on, regardless of what other people think. In other prisons I often came to blows with men who picked on me. When that happened I never had any support from anyone else, not even others who were bisexual or gay. I think they were frightened that if they supported me they might get picked on in the same way as I was and get bullied. The majority of prisoners felt that gay, bisexual or transgender people were sick and as a result you were constantly targeted just for being the way you are. Before I came here I did not believe that I would be treated the same as the other prisoners because I am a woman trapped in a male body. It was a surprise to be treated exactly the same, and staff have given me jobs. The support is across the board, be it from the LGBT group, healthcare or wing officers. Having settled more into my gender, the journey on the motorway is speeding up and I am changing lanes. There are times I feel so relaxed and happy I am actually in the fast lane. It’s a lot down to the environment you are living in and the attitudes of those around you. An officer’s view Ginny, prison officer Maybe it’s because the gay community in the prison is rather small that relationships are so cliquey, or maybe it’s because this job is possibly only suited to strong individuals, that so many gay women fit in so well. I think maybe society expects women working in a prison environment to be gay. On my first day of entering the prison gates after having been in the classroom with new trainnees for three weeks, I was asked by my trainer: “So do you fancy men, women or both?” This was said very openly and in front of everyone else. My answer was: “It depends what mood I am in”. This same relaxed attitude I have found in every department I have worked in. As for the prisoners we have the pleasure of looking after, well, you get comments just like everyone else does. Some people will shout abuse through the window like “lezza” and “dyke” … but then a straight woman can walk past and they will call them a slag or a tart, so I never take anything to heart. I was told the other day by a client: “Leave some women for us will ya,”… news had obviously got out that I had a date on the weekend. Cell relationship Daniel, prisoner Being gay in prison is difficult. I have spent a lot of my adult life inside and although I am gay I never told anyone. As a result I have felt very lonely and alone. Other prisoners would crack jokes and say bad things about gay men and I would just have to listen. It used to get to me. I just wanted to get up on the roof and shout it out, but of course I didn’t because I was scared. I am not the sort of guy that you would look at and say “he’s gay”, as I look like everyone else – a bit rough – and I have a reputation for being quite hard. But inside it is a different story. One day I was working in the servery, dishing out the food, when another prisoner said to me “Come on admit it! I know you’re gay.” He was sort of messing about but I had had enough and snapped: “Yea! So what? What you gonna do about it?” He replied: “No, it’s cool with me, I’m still your mate.” But, pretty soon everyone on the wing was talking about it. During break this other guy came up to me and asked me directly, he called me “loverboy”. I went sorta [sic] nuts and said: “Are you taking the piss?” He backed off and after that no one dared confront me though I’m sure they all knew. This made me feel very uncomfortable, because if I started talking to anyone I was afraid that they would think that I was coming on to them, and make me feel a fool. Eventually, I got two-ed up with another guy and we started a relationship. We thought no one knew but on a wing it’s hard to keep things private for long. I was really shocked when my personal officer asked me if I needed condoms and that I just had to ask. I was embarrassed. Also, other prisoners started asking: “Are you two gay?” I’d always deny it though it was, I guess, common knowledge. We were in a relationship for 18 months. Then my pad mate got moved to another wing. I was upset as I cared for him. It was hard for us to stay in contact and then I got released. I wrote to him regularly and got two letters back before I got recalled and came back to prison. I was looking forward to seeing him again. We were not on the same wing, however, and it wasn’t long before he was released. After that I never saw him again.     Mark’s drawing    Don’t give up Mark, prisoner I had a poem sent to me called Don’t Give Up. I find it helpful to anyone thinking of wanting to give up in life because of their fear of their sexuality. I have read the poem several times and I have done a drawing to go with it. The drawing is about the way you are feeling if you haven’t come out about your sexuality, or you are scared and don’t know how to deal with it. It is a man stood there in tears not knowing where to turn and the bars are there expressing there’s no way out, or so he feels. This drawing could have different meanings to different people, but there will always be a way forward and a way out of the worries and fears you have in your head.  • A complete copy of the book Inside and Out can be read here",2015-08-12T06:29:17Z,Coming out: LGBT people lift the lid on life in prison,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""aafe9672a66b748048b627d4cbe3d08b7b55353a""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/aafe9672a66b748048b627d4cbe3d08b7b55353a/0_0_3744_2246/1000.jpg"" alt=""Phil Forder in the kiln room of HM Parc prison.

"When I was elected mayor of North Down in 2013, I pledged to provide courageous civic leadership for everyone. I therefore reached out to people and organisations not previously included in local civic life, and was delighted to welcome to Bangor Castle town hall groups including charities, the Gaelic Athletic Association and, on two occasions, the Orange Order.On 17 May, the International Day against Homophobia and Transphobia, I was keen to welcome members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community to the mayor's parlour. After a few informal conversations, an invitation was extended to members of the community collective Queer Space to visit the town hall for tea. Someone from the group kindly agreed to bring a cake.As everyone arrived on the day, I was told there had been a problem – the bakery that had been asked to produce a cake with a slogan supporting gay marriage had refused to do so. Thankfully, another Bangor bakery stepped in, and the cake incident prompted a useful discussion of the reasons homophobia and transphobia still need to be challenged.A few weeks later it emerged that the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland was pursuing a case against the bakery. This is under legislation that outlaws discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation in the provision of goods, facilities and services. I am extremely grateful to the Equality Commission, and the man who tried to purchase the cake, for following up the matter. Discrimination – whether on the grounds of race, religion, political opinion, sexual orientation, age, sex, disability or any other background – is wrong and must be challenged.I am the first openly gay man to serve as a mayor in Northern Ireland, but when I came out in 1996 I thought the role I aspired to in elected politics would not be open to me. I sought a life at university in England, but thankfully soon returned, transferring to the University of Ulster in Derry where I committed myself to changing Northern Ireland, becoming an active member of the gay community and chairperson of a lesbian and gay organisation and North West Pride.My time at university wasn't without incident. While walking through the city, homophobic abuse was shouted and rocks were thrown. Vile homophobic graffiti also appeared around my home. One day, on visiting an off-licence, I was surprised when staff started joking and laughing when I was in the shop. I overheard some of the jokes and it was clear they were homophobic. When I arrived at the till to pay for my goods I was refused service, so I know just how hurtful and damaging this can be.Undeterred, I worked with the police to help improve their response, and while I experienced discrimination in later years in the workplace, and again in the street, the level of harassment and violence has reduced and enabled me to fulfil a positive year as mayor.Northern Ireland remains a deeply divided society – but we are gradually moving to a more diverse, inclusive and prosperous future. I am determined to lead this change and am proud of my track record as mayor, standing up and speaking out for those on the edge of society who have been marginalised for too long, whether they are members of the Islamic community, those without a home or LGBT people.I am grateful for the extremely positive response I received when I was elected mayor, and am proud that Northern Ireland is an overwhelmingly open, welcoming and accepting society, despite the negative headlines that sometimes appear. Compared with when I came out as a gay man in 1996, Northern Irish society has transformed and is continuing to progress because of the commitment and courage shown by many, including the many brave members of our LGBT community.The equal marriage that Queer Space was calling for isn't yet legal in Northern Ireland, and it may not be for some time. But through respectful dialogue, commitment and leadership I hope we can realise a more equal society.",2014-07-09T12:08:27Z,An unbaked cake shows Northern Ireland must still improve on gay rights,,67,"<strong>Andrew Muir: </strong>As a campaigner and a councillor I've seen things can change for the better, but more must be done to protect LGBT people",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/9/1404905298693/Gay-Pride-March-Through-L-006.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/09/cake-northern-ireland-gay-rights-lgbt,3
"Decades of frozen diplomatic relations between the US and Cuba came to an end this week when the the Cuban flag was raised in Washington DC for the first time in 54 years – an especially poignant moment for members of the Gay Men’s Chorus of Washington DC, who had ended a tour in Havana two days before. The chorus is one of the first American cultural delegations to visit since the US president, Barack Obama, and his Cuban counterpart, Raúl Castro, announced in December that the two countries would normalize relations.   Related: Cuban same-sex couples 'wed' in march for LGBT rights led by Castro's daughter    They took advantage of the country’s increasing accessibility, where, in the past, Fidel Castro had routinely sent openly gay men and women to labor camps in the decades following the revolution. So what did they find? Clandestine gay bars and an LGBT community that is seeking recognition from their fellow citizens.  Fidel Castro said in 2010 that the labor camps, which people were sent to in the 1970s, were an “injustice”, and his brother Raúl Castro, who is now president, has overseen the most significant steps forward for the LGBT community in the country’s history. But the gains are somewhat overshadowed by the country’s limits on freedom of expression and other civil rights, the chorus’s executive director, Chase Maggiano, told the Guardian. “A lot of what we were singing were songs about being yourself: ‘say what you want to say’ is one of the lyrics we sang over and over again,” said Maggiano. “We realized that the lyric ‘say what you want to say’ carries much more weight when you sing it to a bunch of Cubans who on many levels haven’t been able to say what they want to say for so long.” Twenty members of the 300-person chorus went on the trip, which was organized by Youth For Understanding USA (YFU), a nonprofit that arranges cultural exchanges for students. This was the first YFU adult trip and it received backing from Raúl Castro’s daughter, Mariela Castro, the country’s most prominent LGBT rights advocate.     US and rainbow flags fly outside the hotel in Cuba where the Gay Men’s Chorus of Washington DC were staying. Photograph: Chase Maggiano    Before the trip, Maggiano and other chorus members met with the State Department and spoke with the Human Rights Campaign to be briefed on what to expect, but on-the-ground, question-and-answer sessions held after their performances provided an insight into what life is like for LGBT Cubans. These discussions provided the chorus with a stark depiction of the differences between LGBT rights in Cuba and the US. After one show, Maggiano said an audience member asked how the group was able to organize as an LGBT activist group, leading Maggiano to give the details of becoming a nonprofit, but the man in the audience became emotional and cut him off to clarify. He wasn’t interested in the practical process, he wanted to know when the chorus members felt like the LGBT voice was recognized in the US. “Because in Cuba, even though a lot of really positive things are happening with LGBT rights it sounds like they are still not feeling heard,” Maggiano said. He realized then that he had to be more careful about what advice he could give out – the men’s chorus is safe to perform on the steps of the supreme court in Washington DC to celebrate same-sex marriage being made legal in the US – but in Cuba, marriage equality still seems far off and the annual Pride parade is in only its eighth year.  “I didn’t want him to speak up and protest on the steps of the Capitol, because when you do that in Cuba, you get arrested,” said Maggiano. “It’s a delicate balance to try and push for more rights within their system and stay within what is acceptable in their government.” Between performances and a visit to the countryside, the chorus also had time to stop by some of the key sanctuaries for Cuba’s LGBT community – the gay bars. Chorus member AJ Rawls said that while the bars blasted American music videos and had “very attractive” bartenders, just like your typical US gay bar, unlike in the US, they had a bland outside appearance and inside there were many people who made it clear that they would accept money for sexual favors. Rawls thinks it’s because the gay community is still so small in Cuba that people may be willing to pay for what is still seen as a more underground activity. He also noted that like in some parts of the US, it’s clear that LGBT people in cosmopolitan areas are in a much better position than those in more isolated rural areas.     A Cuban audience appreciates the Gay Men’s Chorus of Washington. Photograph: AJ Rawls    Rawls, who at 25 was the youngest member of the group, was born after the cold war ended, but as an American he had always felt the deep divide between his home country and Cuba. “In my lifetime, the idea of being an out gay man going to Cuba and singing for government officials, that just seemed like a pipe dream for me,” Rawls said. And while the trip showed him how this gap is closing, after the group boarded its chartered flight to Miami, they were reminded that flying the Cuban flag in the US capital is a small step in easing more than half a century of strained relations. The flight, filled almost entirely with Americans, was stuck on the tarmac, having been told that they needed further clearance from the US Department of Homeland Security. “It sort of brought everything home,” said Rawls. “We had a fantastic experience in Cuba, but opening diplomatic relations is a lot easier said than done.” While the group said Cubans were happy to see Americans and said that they look forward to being able to visit the country, travel restrictions remain in place between the two countries, as does the economic embargo. “I always just assumed that today everyone is going to be able to go down to Cuba no problem, but it’s going to take a lot of time and a lot of coordinated effort from both parties to make it work,” said Rawls.

"Gay, lesbian and bisexual people fear discrimination when arranging a funeral, according to a survey where one in ten respondents say they have experienced prejudice first hand following the death of a loved one or close friend.A joint report by campaign group Stonewall and the UK's largest funeral director – Co-operative FuneralCare – says it has uncovered poor treatment towards grieving members of the gay community, with family members and religious leaders most likely to discriminate against them in this situation.One in four of the 522 adults surveyed by YouGov said they expect to face barriers when planning a funeral, with almost a quarter worried about being treated poorly by a funeral director when arranging a funeral. Two out of five feared the reaction they would get from religious leaders or officials while one in five worried about discrimination from family members.Stonewall and Co-operative FuneralCare have published a guide for lesbian, gay and bisexual people on planning for later life, which includes advice on the law, making financial provision such as a will or purchasing a funeral plan, and planning and arranging a funeral.George Tinning, managing director of Co-operative Funeralcare, said: ""Despite changes to the law to provide equal rights for people regardless of their sexual orientation and a perceived greater acceptance in society, it is clear from our research that barriers remain even in death. The death of a loved one can be deeply distressing but at a time when people should expect sympathy and understanding, many gay people have faced poor treatment which is simply unacceptable.""",2014-07-16T17:01:15Z,"Gay people face discrimination when arranging funerals, survey reveals",,69,<p>Co-op Funeralcare director says 'barriers remain even in death' as survey shows 25% of LGBT people expect to face prejudice</p>,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/16/1405529506794/Co-op-funeralcare-006.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/16/gay-lesbian-funeral-arranging-discrimination-survey,3
"Reports of alleged racist and other discriminatory abuse made to the Football Association last season rose sharply to 887 incidents at all levels of the game, a 21% increase on the number reported to the governing body in 2013-14. Football’s anti-discrimination campaign Kick It Out also received a large increase in incidents reported to it: 393 last season, a 38% rise from the 284 in 2013-14. Most of the alleged incidents reported to Kick It Out, 57%, related to racial abuse, the organisation said, while the FA also confirmed that: “Offences relating to race continue to dominate at both professional and grass roots levels.” Other alleged abuse reported to both the FA and Kick It Out related to sexual orientation, faith – mostly antisemitism with three complaints of alleged Islamophobia to the FA – sexism and abuse aimed at disabled people. Lord Herman Ouseley, the chairman of Kick It Out, warned that hatred and prejudice is being fomented by the tone of public debate about immigrants and minorities, and he called on public figures including David Cameron to be more careful about the language they use. Ouseley pointed to the prime minister’s use in July of the word “swarm” to describe people trying to come to Britain from Calais, which was condemned by the Labour leadership contender Yvette Cooper and the Refugee Council, as an example of hostile language which Ouseley said is contributing to greater prejudice in Britain. “There is a lot of misinformation around, and the tone of the immigration discussion and austerity atmosphere, in which groups of people are depicted as being a swarm, bringing problems, coming to Britain for benefits, is feeding into people’s prejudices,” Ouseley said. “We are seeing that reflected in football, although procedures are improving and people know they can’t get away with very much. David Cameron, and all politicians and public figures, have a duty to give leadership on how they speak about these issues, otherwise hatred will explode.” The FA said that the 887 reports of discriminatory incidents related to the professional and amateur game in 2014-15, and that it had generally reduced the time it has taken to deal with them.   Related: Liverpool’s Brendan Rodgers ‘shocked’ by online racist abuse of Mario Balotelli    Mark Ives, the FA’s head of judicial services, said he welcomed the increase in reports, believing it reflects a greater willingness by complainants to trust that incidents will be dealt with. Following a programme initiated by the governing body centrally, every county FA now has an anti-discrimination panel to hear cases, with a chairperson trained to understand issues of racism and discrimination. To increase the openness of the process and show the football public that cases, particularly in amateur football, are being taken seriously, the FA now publishes panels’ written reasons for their decisions on the websites of all the county FAs. “Figures for both reports and convictions [of discriminatory incidents] continue to rise,” Ives said, “as it indicates people have an increased confidence in what constitutes discrimination and how to report it. We envisaged this happening two seasons ago when we began to introduce new and clearer procedures for reporting discrimination and dealing with related cases.” Ouseley agreed that the FA’s processes have greatly improved since they were overhauled two years ago following widespread criticism and a Downing Street summit with Cameron who demanded action then. Ouseley said complaints are now investigated and dealt with more quickly, and people do receive an answer. “We are encouraged on a number of fronts,” he said. Kick It Out have launched and improved a mobile phone app which enables people to instantly report racist abuse within stadiums, and it recorded 36 reports received via the app last season. Of the 393 total incidents reported to Kick It Out, the largest category was 165 which related to posts on social media, 80 of which were passed on to the police. Yet that figure of reported alleged incidents is a fraction of the total number of hate messages circulating on social media, which research for the campaign found to be 134,000 relating to football or players, just for the period of August to March last season.",2015-09-03T21:59:01Z,Racist abuse on rise in football as Lord Ouseley hits out at David Cameron,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-73bf9f86-85f7-4d0f-8a7f-110010482e0e""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/2/1441233336447/7fa5103d-6e51-4bec-97f6-52e79aa1f821-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Lord Herman Ouseley"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Lord Herman Ouseley, chairman of Kick It Out, called on the prime minister David Cameron to be careful when talking about immigrants and minorities.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Antonio Zazueta Olmos</span> </figcaption> </figure>",70,Reports of racist and discriminatory language up 21% while Kick It Out also receives 38% increase in complaints,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/2/1441233336850/e90a041d-6190-489e-b191-d4a47c3b1166-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/03/racist-discrimination-on-rise-in-football-complaints-kick-it-out,8
"There's going to be an be an LGBT focus to all our activity on the site this week, including something for all ages. Here's an overview of what's coming up .We want to say a big thank you to everyone (site members, authors, tweeters) who has recommended books that have changed or added to their perspective on anything LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) for this blog so far. What LGBT gems have we missed? If you've read a mind-expanding LGBT book share it on Twitter @GdnChildrensBks or email childrens.books@theguardian.com and we'll add more books to the list throughout this week! Hawwa, site memberFar From You by Tess Sharpe was an eye-opening novel that really changed my perspective on LGBT and was a refreshing stance to read from concerning love because who's slightly sick of stereotypical boy-girl romances? *raises hand*The Dormouse, site member The book that really made me reflect on homophobia issues was What's up with Jody Barton? by Hayley Long. The emotions of the character really opened my eyes to the way that feelings for any person (opposite gender or not) can be confusing and play around with your self confidence and happiness across all aspects of your life. It reaffirmed for me that something with such an impact on a person as who they fall in love with should be respected, no matter who the feelings are for.James Dawson, author of Cruel Summer Every Day by David Levithan forced me to examine my own position on gender and sexuality and whether they even matter. Body-jumping character 'A' has no fixed gender and simply falls in love with a girl called Rhiannon. Through her, the reader must address their own hang ups. A fantastic, mind-altering read.Linda Newberry, author of The Shell HouseI'd like to add three books which were out there well before the repeal of Section 28: Dance on My Grave and Postcards from No Mans Land, by Aidan Chambers, and The Other Side of the Fence by Jean Ure. Andrew Smith, author of Grasshopper JungleI love Benjamin Alire Saenz's beautifully written novel Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe because of the straightforward, comfortable, and compassionate way Saenz presents his characters that, I think, truly opens readers' eyes and minds to the wholeness and humanness of gay adolescents.David Levithan, author of Two Boys Kissing Francesca Lia Block's Weetzie Bat opened my mind to the notion that life and circumstance are as much about music they are about plot, by combining the fantastical with the painful.  Darren Stein, filmmaker and director of GBFThe queerness of Katherine Dunne's Geek Love  really spoke to me. It was about otherness in the form of a tight-knit family of circus freaks who are portrayed in such harrowing, baroque detail while still being profoundly human in their grotesqueness. Lili Wilkinson, author of Pink and Love Shy I'm loving the relatively recent expansion of LGBT fiction into fantasy and SF, with titles like Alaya Dawn Johnson's The Summer Prince, set in a futuristic Brazil, the story merges love, art, technology, rebellion, and ritual sacrifice, all with a fluidity of race and sexuality that is truly refreshing.Alice Oseman, 19-year-old author of Solitaire published July 2014 I'm a teenager. So it's probably unsurprising that it was John Green who introduced me to the vast universe of contemporary YA fiction. And it was Will Grayson, Will Grayson, co-written by him and David Levithan, which first brought me to books featuring LGBT+ characters. A fun but poignant, unabashedly fabulous and often heart-breaking novel; it is the reason why I will always include LGBT+ characters in my writing. Not only does it effortlessly merge LGBT+ themes into its story, but it also proves that being LGBT+ does not have to be the most interesting or important thing about a person. Susie Day, author of the Pea series I recommend Pretend You Love Me by Julie Anne Peters, which I read as an adult. It's got it all: a plainly doomed (but utterly convincing) first love, family crisis, fear of the future. The intense claustrophobia of a small Kansas farm town is reflected in the dense, vivid writing, but what really stands out is protagonist Mike. Popular culture is pleasingly reluctant to stereotype, but that means we don't often see a 'butch' lesbian teen on-screen or in fiction; I found it a compelling, refreshing and unapologetic insight.Joanne Horniman, author of About a Girl Kitchen, by Banana Yoshimoto. After Mikage's grandmother dies and she is left alone, she accepts an invitation to move in for a while with two people she barely knows: Yuichi and his mother, a beautiful transvestite who owns a bar. This short, elegant novel, with its deceptively simple and often colloquial style is full of warmth; a meditation on loss, loneliness, the human heart, love, acceptance and kitchens, at once quotidian and transcendent, a book larger in scope and depth than you'd expect from its little over a hundred pages; a book I never tire of reading.Avery, site memberBeautiful Music for Ugly Children because of its ability to address transgender issues without making them the only focus of the novel (also, Gabe, the main character, is the most adorable young man since forever). Every Day by David Levithan was also amazing because its main character switched bodies every day, changing genders and sexualities with his body.Liz Kessler, author of North of NowhereI'm going to recommend the very first and the most recent LGBT-themed books I've read. The first, which I read many years ago whilst at university, was Rubyfruit Jungle by Rita Mae Brown. As this was many (too many!) years ago, I'm afraid I can't really remember that much about it – but I remember loving it. The most recent LGBT-themed book I read was Malorie Blackman's wonderful Boys Don't Cry. I loved every bit of this book, and, well, boys might not cry but I certainly did. A LOT!@JenoSkello, on emailOne book which has impacted my life is The Miseducation of Cameron Post by Emily Danforth. I read it when it first came out a few years ago, and it blew me away. It was such a true and emotional story, and beautifully written. After I'd finished I was overjoyed that such a book is out there and winning awards and recognition in the LGBT *and* mainstream book world so there's more chance that it would fall into the hands of a teenager struggling with their identity. It's the sort of book I wish I'd had when I was younger, but I'm so so happy it's in the world for teens today. Alice, site memberI am 18 and have been reading voraciously throughout my teens so I have a few books to recommned. First Luna by Julie Anne Peters - it's about a girl whose sibling is a trans girl, still in the closet and coming to terms with it.It completely changed my perspective on trans- and otherwise non-gender conforming people. I had never really thought about it, only dismissed them as weird, and suddenly I understood how one could be trapped, and how being recognised as the gender you are matters. Especially I was struck at how Luna had always felt this way, even as a little girl in a boy's body.I think it's great as an introduction for people who know nothing about being transgender and who have assumptions already (don't we all?). Also  Maggot Moon by Sally Gardner – very original, with a queer twist I did not expect (and nor did the narrator.), which made it all that much more sweet. And Every Day by David Levithan – in which A wakes up in a new body everyday. This book was amazing at showing all the different experiences we have, and how much gender and body doesn't matter in loving- and how it does at the same time. Reading this felt like taking a big swig of compassion. Finally More Than This by Patrick Ness –  this book touched two of my experiences: being queer and being depressed/not OK. It was page turning and scary, and a lot bigger than can be resumed really. The love of the main character for Gudmund, though, was heartbreakingly beautiful.Conclusion is: more queer books needed! and more queer books that aren't just about being queer. And more girls. :)Hai Tran, site memberAhh, LGBT! LGBT has been a remarkable issue in this century, where prejudice against lesbians and gays is gradually disappearing, and people are given more freedom to express their true selves. So far, I have not read many books about LGBT for my country has just passed a law which allows homosexual loves recently. My favorite LGBT book is Boy Meets Boy by David Levithan. Oh, dear Mr Levithan, I sincerely thank you for guiding me to the LGBT world!  Other great books about LGBT are Fun Home by Alison Bechdel and Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Sáenz. Nina from teen blog Death, Books and TeaLuna by Julie Anne Peters is one of the few books that made me cry. It's the tale of transgirl Luna seen through her sister's eyes, and the ending is hopeful and beautiful.Two Boys Kissing by David Leviathan has this chorus of men who died of Aids narrating it which provides perspective on past, current and future generations of gay teens, and it really made me think about how lucky I, as a queer teen, am to be growing up in a world where attitudes towards queer people are slowly changing for the better.Pantomime by Laura Lam appreciative of a book that, unlike some people and some media when it comes up, recognises and addresses gender identity and sexual orientation as  totally separate things.On Twitter @caaulfieldWill Grayson, Will Grayson :-) by David Levithan‏On Twitter @tanya_rayax  The Color Purple by Alice Walker and Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit by Jeanette Winterson ‏On Twitter @Anna_RobertsX How I Live Now by Meg Rosoff – what a bookOn Twitter @YABirminghamDefinitely 'Kiss in the Dark' by @cat_clarke for me.On Twitter ‏@SpeakingofBks Far From You (Tess Sharpe) More Than This (Patrick Ness) and Being a Boy (James Dawson).

It's wonderful and touching and made and makes me feel so positive.Pretty Things by Sarra Manning: another kinda old one, but one of the most realistic portrayals of bisexuality out there and full of really genuine and different characters. Far From You by Tess Sharpe: It's a fairly new book but it's just so impactful. It has this really intense plotline and the relationship element was so perfect and so fraught and so tragic in a truly exquisite way. Pantomime by Laura Lam: Hard to describe this one without giving away too many spoilers, but it touches on the elements of LGBT that are less looked at in a really genuine and important way but in this extraordinarily rich and detailed universe. BJ Epstein, author of Are The Kids All Right? I Am J by Cris Beam: This is a good trans YA novel because unlike most such works, the focus isn't only on gender. While J does face some difficult times, other issues also come up, such as arguing with friends, changing schools, developing hobbies, applying to art school, dating, and dreams for the future. I also like it because it features ethnic and religious diversity.Aneta, site memberI live in a society that thinks gay people are mentally ill. I have been taught to stay away from them, and any movies featuring them are social taboo. Even my friends who are the so called ""new generation"" have a laissez-faire attitude towards the LGBT. I used to be anti-LGBT. If I changed my ideology, it's because I read. It's because some writers were able to convince me that human beings are not assembly line products.I have since read a lot of books that I have shelved as LGBT. But only two books actually made me think about it and have serious midnight discussions with my friends.Two Boys Kissing - David Levithan – I love a book that uses lyrical prose. couple that with a Greek chorus narration and I'm in love. The narrators tell us about different people with a main plot as a thread. And I loved the brazen cover. I loved the shock people showed when they saw it. Beautiful Music For Ugly Children – I can't claim to have read a lot about trangender people. With the kind of title it has, I had to pick it up. This wasn't a story that demanded sympathy, it just wanted to tell itself.Emily C, site memberBeautiful Music for Ugly Children by Kirstin Cronn-MillsIt's an important book because there really are not that many books that portray transgender teens for young adults out there, particularly not as main characters. Gabe is a great, memorable character, and also a very relatable one. It's also a good book because it is not ONLY about the fact he's transgender, though that's a big part of it. It's important because not only does it provide relevant information and a character to identify with for trans teens, it also helps cisgender teens to understand somewhat what it is like to be trans, and hopefully will help them to be more accepting of people different from them.Alan Gibbons, author of HateRubyfruit Jungle by Rita Mae Brown was one of the first novels I came across that featured a gay or lesbian character who came across as a real person. Jeanette Winterson's Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit had a big impact partly because I shared the characters' northern chapel background and the sense of claustrophobic morality.""On Twitter ‏@RPS_LibraryMy Most Excellent Year, by Steve Kluger. One of the happiest, most loving books I've ever read and and Beauty Queens by Libba Bray! Hilarious and empowering.On Twitter @mabel_tsui  The Well of Loneliness by Radclyffe Hall.On email, AndrewI found a beautiful colouring in book last week called Sometimes the Spoon Runs Away with Another Spoon by Jacinta Bunnell and Nathaniel Kusinitz. I immediately bought it, and the next thing on my shopping list is some colouring pencils!On email, Sian Cain Without a doubt, Maurice by EM Forster is both the most romantic and the bravest book I have ever read. Written in 1913 but published posthumously in 1971, this classic novel is filled with Forster's longing and hope for society's eventual acceptance and recognition of gay relationships.On Twitter @mark_suenA boy's Own Story by Edmund white.On Twitter @JamesMackayCypAnd Tango Makes Three and 10,000 Dresses.On email, JonathanFor younger children I like these two picture books.  They aren't my child's favourite, but I like them and they are both lovely stories that feature same sex relationships.  King and King by Linda De Haan and Stern Nijland and Hello Sailor by Andre Sollie and Ingrid Godon.MillenniumRIOT, site membersOur favourites are The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chobsky, Pantomime by Laura Lam and Will Grayson Will Grayson by John Green.On email, DeborahWhat We Hide by Marthe Jocelyn. Terrific book, overall, and gorgeous gay coming of age/love story plot and Beyond Magenta by Susan Kuklin. Nonfiction – portrait of transgender youth, told in their own words. A must-have for every school/library. Frank Cottrell Boyce, authorSome of the richest seams of gay culture are those that were mined by artists who had to use disguises and codes. ""The more autobiographical a story is,  the more wildly inventive you need to be to tell it"". So Tove Jansson should definitely be on this list! Her characters – the inseparable Thingummy and Bob with their stolen ruby and secret code, the highly competent and utterly calm Too Ticky – are some of the most endearing gay characters in all literature.On email, ElizabethMagic's Pawn, Mercedes Lackey and the sequels.On email, SusannahJust wanted to add to your list a great YA book that I read recently on the subject of intersex people. It is called ""Golden Boy"" by Abigail Tarttelin. On email, LaraineI really recommend Rose Christo's Gives Light series, an original heartfelt YA story set on a reservation in Arizona. This authentic sense of place and the main characters wonderful layered complexity create a story that is unlike any coming of age/exploring sexuality novel I have read.On email, AndyWhen I wanted to educate children about my own coming out I gave them a copy of Two Weeks With The Queen by Maurice Gleitzman. Wonderful and accessible coverage of love, death, AIDS, sexuality, and friendship.On Twitter @ChristasBooksI personally recommend One Man Guy by Micheal Barakiva and Kiss the Morning Star by Elissa Janine Hoole.Kate Constable author of Always McKenzie I'd like to suggest Timothy Conigrave's Holding The Man, a best-selling and very moving memoir from 1995, which revealed to mainstream Australian readers that two ordinary, football-playing schoolboys could fall in love. This was such an important book for my generation, for queers and questioners as well as people who barely knew that queers and questioners existed.On Twitter @cartoonyphiliD Postcards From No Man's Land by Aidan Chambers (1999) sensitively written, young man finding out about himself &amp;WW2 Holland, Two Weeks With The Queen by Morris Gleitzman - v funny v human.On email, EoinWho Lies Inside by Timothy Ireland.  I found it in a public library in Copenhagen in 1994. It spoke to me as a 20 year old in a profound way. I read it cover to cover in one night and then hid it under my mattress. I started the process of coming out a month later.  On email, JamesThese aren't children's books but would be enjoyed by young adults - any of the Russell Quant mysteries by Anthony Bidulka. On email, DarrenTithe, Valiant, and Ironside by Holly Black. Great re-tellings in novel form of classic fairy tale motifs where issues such as sexuality and gender stereotypes are dealt with in the background of great story telling. Great reads and not pointedly LGBT so no finger wagging or special case begging,  just genuine characters from all walks of life.On email, ChristyRarely feel the urge to comment but could you consider adding some memoir? Modern Nature by Derek Jarman and Borrowed Time by Paul Monette have stayed with me from adolescence, and I still prefer people's stories about themselves to biography. For fiction the complete works of Jane Rule (still re-read my hoarded Naiad editions)...  On email, JenniferPlease add What We Hide by Marthe Jocelyn to your list!On email, MelAs a reader of LGBT YA books and someone who has read many of the books on the list I would like to add a book series that I love and fits in this genre of books quite well - the Russell Middlebrook series by Brent Hartinger. The first book has also been turned into a movie which I recommend.  On email, PeterFor a brilliant Australian perspective Two Weeks with the Queen by Morris Gleitzman made me cry as an adult and wish I had access to such books as a child. Aidan Chambers, Dance on My Grave (Horizons)On email, PennyI was waiting for a mention of Aidan Chambers. But Dance on my Grave made a great impact on me 30 years ago as first gay love story as so sensitive and touching. A love story to be relished by anyone and everyone. Forster's Maurice wins the classic slot for me. I was disappointed with the more recent More Than This by Patrick Ness for being so tragic. First love should never be your last (but i guess Shakespeare warned us first!).On email, MariaChris Matthew's Mudlark is a young adult fantasy book that has boys in love, strong girls who rescue themselves, and asks serious questions around difference and fascism. Inspiring and fascinating read.On twitter, @KimHarte  Flick by Geraldine Mead must be added to the list!On email, Clare from Out for Our Children Our faves are the Sissy Duckling, Something Else, And Tango Makes Three, the Paper Bag Princess and King and King - mostly suitable for 3-6 years old.Daniel Vilmure, Toby's LieOn email, AndrewI love Toby's Lie by Daniel Vilmure. My Mam bought it for me a few years after I came out to her and my Dad. It was her way of saying ""I accept you"".On email, NickI've been a fan of Strange Boy by Paul Magrs since it was published in 2002, and it remains one of the most beautiful and interesting queer YA novels published in this country. It's a semi-fictional memoir with elements of magic realism, set on a council estate in County Durham. The characters are sensitively drawn, but they're vibrant and compelling, each with their own dreams and fantasies. In delicate touches of fantasy, there's a wonderful sense that the world itself is not straightforward. There's also a sequel of sorts, Diary of a Dr Who Addict, which follows the lead character into adolescence in the 1980s. Both novels depict the emergence of gay identity as related to a broader queer sensibility, with all sorts of consequences.On email, SaidI remember having to hide Rainbow Boys (by Alex Sanchez) when I was in the midst of realising I was gay as an early teen. I managed to smuggle a copy out of the local library and it was liberating to read a book about characters in the same situation as me. I guess you could say the digital revolution has been a success story for LGBT books, my first purchase on my kindle was Something Like Summer, by Jay Bell. Being able to read a story that was at the best of times gripping and at the worst of times heartbreaking was liberating, especially at a time when I couldn't out myself, the Kindle came up trumps.On email, PatriciaAutobiography of Red by Anne Carson. A novel in verse form, it is the story of a boy named Geryon, based on Geryon the Greek monster. Sexually abused by his older brother, his affectionate mother too weak-willed to protect him, the hideous-looking young boy finds solace in photography and in a romance with a young man named Herakles. Herakles abandons his young lover leaving Geryon heart-broken. When Geryon comes across Herakles several years later, Herakles has a new lover who becomes part of their love triangle.On email, Natashya This book isn't out yet, Robin Talley's Lies We Tell Ourselves (on shelves September 30). It is set in 1959 Virginia, during the de-segregation of a fictional high school, and is told from the perspective of a black girl and a white girl who are not only on opposite sides of the racial divide but are falling in love against all odds. It is a powerful, unforgettable read that shows how far we've come, and just how far we still have to go for civil and human rights in the US.On email, MollyI read through list and saw that many of my favorites are missing (though I have some new books to check out, too!). The Miseducation of Cameron Post by Emily M. Danforth and Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Saenz (they even get a happy ending!) On email, LenoreI would like to suggest How To Repair A Mechanical Heart by JC Lillis. It is a heart-warming story about friendship, fandom, family values, self-acceptance and love, and in my opinion it should be included in every school library.On email, AmyThe Summer I Wasn't Me, by Jessica Verdi, is about two girls who fall in love at an ex-gay camp. It is a beautiful read and and sheds a much needed light on these types of camps.On email, CalenRainbow Boys series by Alex Sanchez (Rainbow Road is my fave), Boy Meets Boy by David Levithan, Hard Love by Ellen Wittlinger, Geography Club series by Brent Hartinger (I like Order of the Poison Oak best), Keeping You a Secret by Julie Anne Peters (and everything else she ever wrote). BUT MY NEW FAVOURITE is a newer book called What They Always Tell Us by Martin Wilson. All the older books take part in the tragifying or sensationalizing of queerness, (yes, even Boy Meets Boy, if only because the reader knows the contrast of their world to ours). What They Always Tell Us is a queer teen model for the modern age where LGBT youths are coming out in more and more accepting environments. It doesn't deny the dangers of coming out to the world, but it skips the agony of coming out to oneself, allowing the love to precede and eclipse the internal struggle of labeling ones queerness that featured so strongly in early millennial queer teen lit. Adults will say I wish I had that and youths will find a desensationalized narrative of queer discovery.On email, JimBR Collins's Love in Revolution, an incredible love story between two girls falling for each other during a revolution in an unnamed Basque country.

It's my partner's all-time favourite LGBT novel; although deemed a bit 'controversial' at the time of publication, it's subtle and funny, and everyone I know who's read this beautiful novel has loved it.On email, LisaCountry Girl, City Girl by Lisa Jahn-Clough deals with early sexuality issues. For younger young adults, age 10 up. You might consider adding it to your list. On email, GykyI would like to share the Filipino children's book written by Bernadette Neri, Ang Ikaklit sa Aming Hardin (Ikaklit in Our Garden).

Although wildly different (one being realism, one a post-apocalyptic re-telling of the Odyssey), they were the first books I – as a pansexual and non-binary teen – read in which I existed. They're also both extremely well-written, and the authors are like the coolest people on the planet.On email, Kathleen from GayYA.org: I'd recommend Silhouette of a Sparrow by Molly Beth Griffin. It's a historical romance with REALLY CUTE QUEER GIRLS set in the 1920's.On email, StaceyI loved Ash and Huntress by Malinda Lo. These were both fantasy fiction with strong female characters.

"Gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or queer/questioning (LGBTQ) people may be at greater risk for seven different cancers than heterosexual and gender-aligned folks are, and a lot of the discrepancy is due to misinformation and lack of regular healthcare in those communities. These factors increase the likelihood that LGBTQ people, who make up some 12% of the population, will avoid important cancer screenings, or be unaware that they are necessary. The upshot is that anal, breast, cervical, colorectal, endometrial, lung and prostate cancers may disproportionately affect the LGBTQ community. For example, available data suggest the risk of dying from breast cancer is 3.2 times higher in lesbian women compared to heterosexual women. A study we published this month with colleagues from the H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center &amp; Research Institute in Tampa and the University of Pennsylvania shows that this knowledge gap in those communities can be traced to the fact that LGBTQ people may lack health insurance or be uncomfortable sharing their sexual orientation or gender identity with their doctors. And even if doctors are aware, they lack comprehensive statistics on risk disparities for those populations. So while at first glance doctors may believe they do not need to know their patients’ sexual orientation or gender identity, and patients may be reluctant to disclose them, a trusted healthcare provider can use this knowledge to assess the patient for risk and make appropriate recommendations. And at the societal level, we need to collect this information to identify trends and best practices. We believe the public should be troubled by the health disparities in this marginalized community. For starters, healthcare providers must make clear to their LGBTQ patients which cancer screenings are needed. Some lesbian women forgo annual gynecological exams, Pap smears, and HPV vaccination, assuming they are not at risk for cervical or endometrial cancers because they do not have sex with men. Gay men, for whom recommendations suggest the HPV vaccine until age 28 – a time window two years longer than for straight men – may not be aware of the expanded vaccination criteria or may decline the vaccine altogether, erroneously assuming it applies only to heterosexuals. And some transgender patients may not take medical care for the parts of their biological body that don’t align with their self-perception. For this reason, a transgender woman with a prostate may not seek regular PSA testing. This all leads to health outcome disparities that could be minimized by providers ensuring their LGBTQ patients have accurate information. We also need better data on the incidence of cancer in LGBTQ populations. Because sexual orientation and gender identity are not captured in national and state cancer registries, it is difficult to quantify cancer statistics for the LGBTQ community in the US. Cancer healthcare providers at present have limited to no information to give to those patients about their potential health outcomes. This means providers and local, state and national registries need to start consistently collecting data on their patients’ sexual orientation and gender identity. This will allow researchers to accurately understand the impact, healthcare needs and outcomes of cancer in the LGBTQ community, which can ultimately provide evidence-based medicine. Our review concluded with a list of recommendations to improve healthcare for the LGBTQ community including: cultural competency training for healthcare professionals, the creation of LGBTQ-friendly provider directories and developing a standardized method for asking about sexual orientation and gender identity in healthcare forms. Most important is the need to create safe environments for patients to disclose this sensitive information. As a growing and medically underserved population, the cancer-related needs and concerns of the LGBTQ community are a crucial area to be addressed.",2015-08-03T15:45:02Z,"To lower LGBTQ people's cancer risk, educate patients – and doctors","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""feeb0b8a1bceaa7a24a79e8451397529eb130a12""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/feeb0b8a1bceaa7a24a79e8451397529eb130a12/0_361_5520_3312/1000.jpg"" alt=""lgbt + cancer"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">LGBTQ people need to know what screening tests they need, and doctors need to know what to tell them.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Andy Katz/Demotix/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>",72,Members of those communities may be uncomfortable sharing their sexual orientation with doctors.

"When a transgender high school student in Missouri received backlash for her request to use the girls’ bathroom and locker room, she found one very important ally: the school board, which granted her permission to use the facilities. According to Kelli Hopkins of the Missouri school board’s association, 17-year-old Lila Perry has been granted her request because of recent guidance issued by the US Department of Education. While there is no “policy per se on transgender students use of bathrooms”, Hopkins said, there is a policy that says “districts cannot discriminate against students based on their gender”. “The Office of Civil Rights of the US Department of Education has said not allowing a transgendered student to use the restroom of the gender of which they identify can be illegal discrimination under Title IX because it’s based on gender. It is their position,” Hopkins said. The district’s superintendent, Aaron D Cornman, issued a statement that said the district “accepts all students no matter race, nationality/ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation. We will promote tolerance and acceptance of all students that attend our district while not tolerating bullying/harassing behaviors of any type in any form.” Despite the school’s support, Perry has seen some backlash from fellow students and parents at Hillsboro high school. Over 100 students protested the decision by walking out of class on Monday. And parents were vocal about their disagreement at a school board meeting on Thursday that had to be moved to a new location because so many people showed up. “The girls have rights, and they shouldn’t have to share a bathroom with a boy,” Tammy Sorden, who has a son at Hillsboro, told St Louis Today. Sorden said that it’s not right to give Perry special treatment “while the girls just have to suck it up”. However, some members of the student body have risen to Perry’s defense. The high school’s gay-straight alliance and other supporters had their own protest to support Perry, according to the Associated Press. Skyla Thompson, who told the AP that Perry is her best friend, said Perry is “such a good person”. “They are just judging her on the outside,” Skyla said about those who have criticized Perry. “It feels really awful that people are going to these extremes against me, not just in school but all over the internet,” Perry told the New York Times. “But I’ve also received so much support. It feels really surreal to be in the middle of all of this.”",2015-09-02T18:11:40Z,Missouri school to allow transgender student to use girls' facilities,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""d982d3f1f1afbc9bd4872ee6e0898002b214a0bc""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/d982d3f1f1afbc9bd4872ee6e0898002b214a0bc/0_330_5047_3027/1000.jpg"" alt=""Missouri transgender student"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The Missouri school board said Lila Perry has been granted her request because of recent guidance issued by the US Department of Education. </span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: D Burke/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>",73,"Board grants Lila Perry’s request to use women’s bathroom and locker room, saying ‘districts cannot discriminate against students based on their gender’",http://media.guim.co.uk/d982d3f1f1afbc9bd4872ee6e0898002b214a0bc/0_330_5047_3027/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/02/missouri-school-board-transgender-student-discrimination,1
"After eight years as sex discrimination commissioner, Elizabeth Broderick has heard every insult under the sun. “A man said to me that gender equality is dog’s balls. I’m not sure what the right response is to that,” she says, laughing.  As her term at the Human Rights Commission draws to a close, Broderick insists that it is the small, seemingly inconsequential interactions that keep her going. She talks of a 60-year-old police officer in Hobart who approached her after a speech to say that hearing made him believe that gender equality existed.   Related: Sex discrimination commissioner calls on men to champion women's rights    Those exchanges, she says, are energising and encourage her to go on. “It’s a journey characterised by persistence … not one giant leap,” she says of obtaining gender equality. Her advice to her successor, who has not yet been announced, is simple. “Do what you can, when you can,” she says. “Don’t respond to the barbs. Have a thick skin.” Before being appointed as commissioner in 2007, Broderick worked as a partner at a multinational law firm. In 2014, at the launch of an initiative to combat sexual harassment, Broderick spoke of her own experience as a young lawyer. An older client repeatedly asked her out, making her increasingly more uncomfortable. “Like most cases of workplace sexual harassment, common elements exist – a significant power imbalance, an inability to tell management, embarrassment, shame, the positive intervention of bystanders and most importantly, I stopped enjoying a job I otherwise loved,” she said at the May 2014 launch. “Until people know where the line is, and know what comments, behaviour and language cross this line, we’re not going to be able to have a fully informed, national discussion about this issue.” Broderick is most proud of the cultural change she has been able to enact in workplaces in her time as commissioner. Overcoming “gender asbestos”, where unconscious bias is “built into the walls and ceilings” of big organisations is everyone’s job, and gains have already been made, she says. The creation of a national paid parental leave scheme – elements of which the Coalition government is now trying to unwind – is a particular source of pride for Broderick. She has criticised the plan to stop primary caregivers from accessing both government and employer schemes as regressive and incompatible with human rights. “I hope that we will see the scheme [continue] in its current form,” she says. The government argues that parents who access both schemes are “double-dipping”, while the social services minister, Scott Morrison, dismissed paid parental leave as a “first world issue” that should not dominate the government’s policy agenda. Broderick warns that people of influence should be mindful of the language they use. “The way we describe things is important and it sends a message about the role of women in society.” In 2011 Broderick tackled one of the most macho organisations in the country – the armed forces. She was tasked with undertaking a review of the treatment of women in the defence forces, following the so-called Skype sex scandal at the Australian Defence Force Academy, when a male cadet filmed himself having sex with a female cadet and shared it without her knowledge. Since then, the army has made gains in gender equality, though the organisation started from a low base. The newly retired chief of army, David Morrison, who commissioned the review, labelled the Skype scandal a “game-changer” that sparked unstoppable change. “I can guarantee you that the momentum for change is now unstoppable,” he said late last year. Broderick says it was a “privilege” to work with the military. “Australia is really advanced in recognising that the treatment of women goes to [defence] capability,” she says. Despite the gains made in some aspects of Australian society, Broderick acknowledges there is still a lot of work to be done. She has advocated strongly for the implementation of quotas for both businesses and in politics. That is a fight she is unlikely to win, with senior – mostly male – figures in the Coalition government rejecting the push for both targets and hard quotas. “I don’t believe in quotas and I don’t believe in targets but I do believe in people being elected on the basis of merit,” the leader of the House of Representatives, Christopher Pyne, told ABC’s 730 program in July. Only two cabinet ministers – the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, and the health minister, Sussan Ley – are women. “Women’s voices are still missing [at the top],” Broderick says – of both politics and managerial roles in business.   Related: 'These women are not statistics' – deaths in Australia in 2015    She wishes she could have done more to stop the scourge of domestic violence; an average of two women a week are being murdered at the hands of male partners or family members. “That’s truly unacceptable,” the commissioner says. Though she is leaving her role and the public platform it gives her, Broderick is pledging to continue her fight for equality. Her next move will involve working on a small number of “high-impact” roles that “elevate women’s voices”. The federal government has not yet announced who will fill the vacancy. A spokesman for the attorney general, George Brandis, told Guardian Australia that the government “will make an announcement on the sex discrimination commissioner, but we don’t have anything to announce at the moment”. The spokesman acknowledged that there had been a “huge amount of speculation” that the role would not be filled to make way for different rights portfolios, but he would not be drawn on whether or not these reports were accurate. Broderick’s last day in the job will be Friday.",2015-09-01T21:21:09Z,'Have a thick skin' – sex discrimination commissioner's advice to her successor,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""6927488f4f3c037cd4cd5157225ae6830b6d14f5""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/6927488f4f3c037cd4cd5157225ae6830b6d14f5/173_273_1011_607/1000.jpg"" alt=""Elizabeth Broderick"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Elizabeth Broderick: ‘A man said to me that gender equality is dog’s balls.

"The average age at which a young LGBT person ""comes out"" is now seventeen, so many will still be at school or college and may well seek out a trusted member of staff for advice. So how should book group leaders approach it?Back when I used to be a teacher, I was involved in a project in which books were used to help create safe spaces for young LGBT people. Fiction can be vital bridging tool between a teacher and a pupil, a buffer to discuss a variety of issues on neutral ground but here I present a few tips for using LGBT friendly texts in the classroom or library.The environmentBefore you can hope to meaningfully discuss LGBT issues you need to ensure the classroom or library is truly a safe physical space. The easiest thing in the world to do is to subtly display a rainbow Pride symbol. At my primary school we put one in the reception office hatch to signal that LGBT families were welcome in our school. You can stick one in the corner of an interactive whiteboard, in a window or on your classroom computer to show you are an ally to LGBT people.It's even more vital that use of homophobic language is shown zero tolerance. How can a meaningful lesson happen with sniggering on the back row? Stonewall's classroom packs are a must in dealing with homophobic language. Even better… get a Stonewall Schools Role Model – like me – to come to your school and do it for you!Younger childrenChildren are never too young to understand that families come in all different shapes and sizes. All primary classes are diverse and so should your teaching be. Primary age children should be presented with diverse characters in picture books – in terms of race, physical ability and sexual orientation.There are some great books out there. And Tango Makes Three by Justin Richardson and Peter Parnell is a must. All young children can sympathise with penguin Roy and penguin Silo's anguish to hatch an egg of their own. Similarly, Todd Parr's The Family Book is as inclusive as it gets. Less explicitly, books like Something Else by Kathryn Cave and Chris Riddell or Giraffes Can't Dance by Giles Andreae are a great way of looking at difference and individuality and can be a valuable starting point for discussions about sexuality.Older primary school aged childrenI used to use The Harvey Milk Story  by Kari Krakow with my Year 5 class. The injustice of Milk's short life is not lost on them and opened a conversation on famous LGBT role models such as Tom Daley. The goal is to encourage pupils who may be starting to use ""gay"" negatively to see it as a positive thing.For older primary age children, Percy Jackson  has a bi friend in the form of Nico di Angelo while Pretty Little Liar Emily Fields is also bi in the bestselling series of the same name. Finally, JK Rowling has said Dumbledore was gay…Secondary school ageIf reading Malorie Blackman's Noughts &amp; Crosses or perennial To Kill A Mockingbird it is be easy to muse on the discrimination of LGBT people as well as racism.There are also gay couples in Patrick Ness's Chaos Walking trilogy  (Ben and Cillian), and in all of my or David Levithan's novels. Perhaps the most famous same-sex YA pairing is Magnus and Alec in the bestselling Mortal Instruments series.An interesting topic of conversation would be to compare books that are about sexuality to books that just happen to feature LGBT characters. Cat Clarke's Undone, for instance, looks at the devastating consequences of homophobic bullying while my own Cruel Summer is a thriller that just happens to have a gay lead. It's important that a variety of LGBT characters are presented – not always gay, white men and certainly not only texts which suggest being LGBT is something to suffer through or be ashamed of.When discussing LGBT characters, examine how they aren't defined by their sexuality and explore their character traits beyond this. Avoid books which do not define characters beyond simply being the ""gay best friend"".RepresentationPerhaps more important than discussing LBGT characters is just making sure they are represented. Five per cent of a school population is likely to be ""not straight/cisgendered"" so these young people deserve to see themselves in posters, educational materials and, of course, in books.Be confident in approaching LGBT issues, the law is on your side and parents or governors can't prevent discussions about them. Again, a great starting point would be applying for Stonewall's schools materials.This article is part of the Guardian children's books site's LGBT themed week.

"The recent US supreme court ruling on marriage equality marked a monumental end to LGBT pride month and many brands were quick to show their support for progressive lawmaking. At the same time, London Pride faced criticism by those who find the rise in corporate sponsorship contrary to the event’s political origins. This tension marks the start of a new phase in LGBT culture.   Related: Lord Browne: LGBT networks are fine, but CEOs must set the tone on inclusion    The intersection between mainstream media and the LGBT community has not always been an easy one. By today’s standards, gay characters from American sitcom Will &amp; Grace appear crudely two-dimensional and stereotyped. Ten years later, shows such as Cucumber, Transparent and Orange is the New Black have introduced a new wave of LGBT representation on the small screen and feature LGBT characters that are rounded and diverse. The fact these shows are market-driven and attract huge audiences (the new season of Orange is the New Black broke Netflix streaming records) represents a massive interest in LGBT culture from a broad audience. With LGBT culture firmly in the mainstream, advertisers are now playing catch-up. When Queer as Folk was on our screens, the ads that ran in between were distinctly heteronormative. The few brands that did communicate with the LGBT community did so cautiously, regarding them as just another niche audience to help top up the numbers. So-called “gay vague” ads, such as Budweiser’s Tops and Bottles and Another One’s Coming Out, relied on ambiguity and coded messages, while Volkswagen’s famous 1997 Sunday Afternoon commercial featured two men in a car, understood either as straight roommates or a gay couple depending on the viewer’s sexuality.     Volkswagen’s famous 1997 Sunday Afternoon ad campaign.    Today, the LGBT community is no longer a niche consumer segment but an influential group whose voice grows stronger all the time. LGBT culture has become a driving force of the mainstream and it’s this fact that attracts advertisers. There are 1.8 billion so-called millennial consumers across the globe (those born between 1982 and the early 2000s), a group characterised by, among other things, its attitude of open-mindedness and tolerance. See how brands like Ray-Ban and Coca-Cola have placed LGBT characters centre-stage in their marketing communications. It’s understandable that such brands also look to LGBT organisations like Pride to express their solidarity and form commercial partnerships. Given the recent strides made in equality, Pride must now arguably reset the agenda and this should include consideration of how to appropriately handle support from brands and corporate sponsors. As for the advertisers and the advertising industry, they must make every effort to become positive partners of the LGBT community and indeed draw lessons from past failures in respect to ethnic diversity in marketing. Guidance for brands  1 LGBT = Diversity LGBT is not a single demographic. The community is incredibly diverse and should be represented honestly. Brands should avoid simply ticking a diversity box by including a white male-male couple. 2 Push the boundaries  The LGBT community is full of colour and contrast. It continues to grow and welcomes new members who have battled misunderstanding and prejudice on a growing spectrum of identity. Brands have a real opportunity to be bold in their support. 3 Don’t just say, do A rainbow-coloured tweet in support of gay marriage only goes so far. In order to build a credible association with the LGBT community, brands must back up messages of support with action. This is especially true for sought-after millennials, who, regardless of sexual orientation, favour brands that act on their words. 4 Be consistent  It takes time to win the respect of any consumer. Brands should avoid jumping on the LGBT bandwagon unless they plan on a lasting and mutually beneficial relationship. 5 Avoid saying one thing here and another thing there Sadly, LGBT rights and not uniform across the world. Global brands must avoid a contradictory stance in different markets. Apple recently found itself in controversy over the Siri app, which answers Russian queries for nearby gay venues with either silence or negativity. Nick Rowland is a brand manager on Smirnoff at 72andSunny Amsterdam and a proud supporter of the LGBT community.

"Recent headlines in Europe and the US could lead you to believe that the momentum is building in favour of equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans (LGBT) people. A deeper look at the data, however, reveals a more complicated story unfolding around the world.In 77 countries it's a crime to be gay; in 10, it can cost you your life. And this number is growing. In the past few months, India has shocked the world by reinstating a colonial rule that criminalises sex between men. This month, Brunei has started to implement a strict new penal code that will allow death by stoning as a punishment for homosexuality and adultery.This rise in anti-gay sentiment is powered in no small part by fringe religious extremists of multiple faiths. It is organised, well-resourced and is dramatically exacerbating the discrimination and violence that LGBT people face. Russia, Uganda and Nigeria are making homophobia the law of the land and stirring up a culture of hate. Their new anti-gay laws, which penalise public advocacy and increase jail sentences for LGBT people, may pale in comparison with the law recently introduced in Kyrgyzstan to penalise any positive statement about homosexuality.And there's more. A recent court ruling in France blocked two married lesbians from adopting each other's child, against the interests of these two children. A Romanian MEP candidate is campaigning on an anti-gay ticket, claiming that the European parliament is failing to maintain traditions and family values. The first two Ugandans to be charged under the ""kill the gays"" law are facing life imprisonment. Waves of arrests of gay people intended to ""exorcise"" or ""cure"" them are being reported in Nigeria.The real human impact of these laws is devastating and can't be underestimated: each day more people must sacrifice their safety and dignity because of who they are or whom they love. Today, we live in a world where our ability to live openly is increasingly a privilege determined largely by the luck of your birth.Members of the Family Foundation and supporters of traditional marriage pray outside court in Richmond, Virginia, this week in advance a ruling on gay marriage in the state. Photograph: Steve Helber/APBut there are powerful signs of hope to challenge these difficult truths. We have witnessed a sea change in marriage equality and victories in anti-discrimination laws. The United States is debating national laws to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation in the workplace. Peru and other countries in Latin America are debating a civil unions bill. India's supreme court has just given citizens the right to self-identify their gender and has granted legal status to a third gender category. The efforts of grassroots and human rights organisations are paying significant dividends.And perhaps most importantly, millions of people around the world are showing that they care enough for equality to stand for love. In just three years, All Out has inspired close to two million people, in every country in the world, to join the equality movement through online campaigns, massive street demonstrations and viral media. More than a third of them are straight and many have never engaged in advocacy before. Yet, they are standing side by side with their friends, family members, neighbours and colleagues demanding equality and making sure that their community, church and corporate leaders, and policymakers help build the world they want.This is what All Out is all about. Bringing the power of people beyond language and geographical barriers to express their solidarity and be a positive force on the side of LGBT people, pushing uphill and making sure lesbian, gay, bi and trans people and their allies are not silenced and pushed into the shadows.Our movement is growing and has already won real victories around the world. We're pushing global companies in Uganda to follow the lead of Orange and speak out in support of the LGBT community. We're building on the global outcry  we inspired against Russia's anti-gay crackdown and bringing scale and resources to grassroots organisations on the frontline of the battle for equality.By joining forces to stand for love against those who would take our dignity, family and freedom because of who we are, our growing movement could realise sweeping change in our lifetime. From 77 countries where it's a crime to be gay to zero. For every anti-gay law that passes, there are now – for the first time in history – thousands of people speaking out against it. That's the kind of momentum that should inspire: hope first, and then change.Andre Banks is co-founder and executive director of All Out, the global movement for love and equality",2014-05-16T12:59:31Z,LGBT rights: the fight is far from over,,77,"<strong>Andre Banks:</strong> It may still be a crime to be gay in 77 countries, but at least now thousands of people are speaking out",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/15/1400168781708/Students-protest-nantes-001.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/16/lgbt-rights-fight-is-far-from-over,5
"Sunday is the first day of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Pride Month, an occasion marked by the White House and couples in Illinois, the most recent state to begin issuing same-sex marriage licenses. &quot;This month, as we mark 45 years since the patrons of the Stonewall Inn defied an unjust policy and awakened a nascent movement, let us honor every brave leader who stood up, sat in, and came out,” read a presidential proclamation issued on Friday. The Stonewall Inn is often referred to as the “birthplace” of the modern gay rights movement. In 1969, New York City police raided the bar and arrested customers on “public morals” charges, sparking demonstrations that summer. “As progress spreads from state to state, as justice is delivered in the courtroom, and as more of our fellow Americans are treated with dignity and respect – our nation becomes not only more accepting, but more equal as well,” the proclamation said. Last June, key provisions of the Defense of Marriage Act were declared unconstitutional by the US supreme court. That law kept same-sex spouses from receiving federal benefits provided to heterosexual married couples, such as filing joint taxes, social security and military benefits.  Since then, federal judges in 13 states have struck down same-sex marriage bans, the latest in Pennsylvania, though rulings are stayed in 11 states. Illinois officially begins issuing same-sex marriage licenses on 1 June. Sixteen counties of the state’s 102 counties began issuing licenses early, including Cook County where Chicago is located. Governor Pat Quinn signed the state’s same-sex marriage law in November 2013 and the legislature approved the law on Valentine’s Day this year. Challenges are expected to every gay marriage ban in the US by mid-summer. A Minneapolis attorney says he or his associates will file a suit in North Dakota, the last state to have its same-sex marriage ban challenged. Public opinion has also swayed – a February poll by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 53% of Americans support gay marriage and 41% oppose it. That is nearly a reverse of the same poll 10 years ago, when less than one-third (32%) of Americans supported gay marriage, and 59% opposed it. Challenges do not necessarily mean that same-sex couples in every state can marry. Gay couples cannot marry in any states in the southeast. Some states, such as Arkansas, Texas and Utah, have struck down gay marriage bans but stayed rulings until higher courts can hear the cases.

According to some polls, it’s generational. For example, a Pew Research Center poll found that 61% of Republicans under 30 support gay marriage. Only 22% of Republicans over 65-years-old share the same view. By contrast, among Democratic leaning Americans of the same age groups, under 30 and over 65, there is only a 15-point difference. Vocal groups such as the Family Research Council also continue to oppose gay marriage. The head of the FRC, Tony Perkins, recently held a panel discussion on restoring the “traditional family” as a Republican priority, Politico reports. And as Friday&apos;s presidential proclamation pointed out, many LGBT couples around the world face persecution and discrimination. &quot;In many places around the globe, LGBT people face persecution, arrest, or even state-sponsored execution,” said the proclamation. &quot;This is unacceptable. The United States calls on every nation to join us in defending the universal human rights of our LGBT brothers and sisters.”",2014-05-31T16:26:26Z,White House marks LGBT Pride Month on eve of legal gay marriage in Illinois,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-fc196d9f-6352-4042-ba76-01f703c87d00""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/31/1401553397592/1498dcb3-9483-4bc6-9961-5c7f80972e6c-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""pennsylvania gay marriage same-sex marriage"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Mike Woods, and Brandon Parsons embrace on the Pennsylvania sate capital steps following a rally with gay rights supporters.

"President Obama just announced a couple executive actions intended to close the wage gap between men and women. &quot;Our job&apos;s not finished yet,&quot; he said at the White House, before signing into law new measures that will make federal contractors enforce limited pay equity rules and that will end certain differences in compensation based on race and gender. That&apos;s good news. The president should sign orders like these, especially on Equal Pay Day – especially in a country where women working full-time make 77 cents for every dollar men do. &quot;In 2014, that&apos;s an embarrassment,&quot; Obama said. &quot;It&apos;s wrong.&quot; You know what else is wrong? That it&apos;s not Equal Pay Day for a lot of us, no matter what the White House hype machine says about these measures &quot;expanding opportunity for all&quot; or &quot;ensuring equal pay for women&quot;. Not unless you&apos;re comfortable with a definition of &quot;all&quot; that means &quot;LGBT need not apply&quot;.  &quot;This executive order only protects me if I walk into the office of a federal contractor appearing straight,&quot; says Heather Cronk, managing director of GetEqual, the LGBT activist group behind the push to rescind Don&apos;t Ask Don&apos;t Tell. She went on to tell me of another executive action, long since forgotten by the Obama administration:  But the minute I mention my female partner, I run the risk of not only getting paid less, but also being fired on the spot. If the president truly wants to move forward the cause of equal pay for all women, he could start by signing another executive order he promised to sign back in 2008 – one that would prohibit discrimination by federal contractors based on sexual orientation and gender identity.  This gripe is neither baseless nor trite. We now live in a county where LGBT people can get married and enjoy federal in 17 states but can be fired for having our spouse&apos;s picture on our desk in 32 of them. The man who vowed during his second inauguration that &quot;our journey is not complete until our wives, our mothers and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts&quot; should ponder the chances of a poor lesbian mother making a go of it with her kids in the southwestern states, where she&apos;ll have no protection against discrimination of any kind, including employment. The executive order that Obama&apos;s been sitting on – for going on, oh, his entire presidency – would protect approximately 26m people, or nearly 22% of the total civilian workforce. It would also, according to Tico Almeida, president of the Freedom to Work organization, &quot;give the US Labor Department strong enforcement powers to seek back wages and reinstatement for LGBT workers who are fired for discriminatory reasons&quot;.  Preventing taxpayer-funded workplace discrimination should be a no-brainer. And yet, Obama&apos;s 2008 campaign promise notwithstanding, the executive order that would include sexual orientation and gender identity has languished for years now. This despite polls that show 88% of Americans – and 86% of Republicans – believe that all Americans, including LGBT Americans, &quot;should be judged on the job they do – nothing more, nothing less&quot;. The White House&apos;s insistence that it&apos;s holding out for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) – or that the passage of ENDA would make an executive order &quot;redundant&quot; – is both silly and untrue. The ENDA, which would federally prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, has been kicking around Congress since 1994; that it passed in the Senate last November means nothing.  &quot;Pending&quot; in the House means &quot;good as dead&quot; in DC these days, and Obama&apos;s stumping today for the Paycheck Fairness Act probably won&apos;t help. That 90% percent of Americans mistakenly believe there&apos;s already a federal law in place prohibiting discrimination against LGBT people in the workplace – well, that does little to break Obama&apos;s inertia.  As the political strategist Paul Yandura told me:  This represents an embarrassing stain on the Obama record. He promised to sign the executive order over six years ago. Yet he&apos;s still dilly dallying while his representatives continue to make up reasons for why he refuses to sign it. Each one lamer than the last.  Today was a day for President Obama to make nice with the many heterosexual women he&apos;s let down, on issues from foreclosure and reproductive health to cabinet appointments and sexual harassment in the military. Come June – gay pride month – he&apos;ll throw LGBT people our bone. How big it is – and whether it&apos;s the one we want – depends on the kind of noise we make.

"When searching the word ""gay"" on the internet, the second suggestion on the most used search engine in the world is a ""gay test"".Propped up by an array of negative stereotyping and homophobic naming practices, a ""gay test"" site will judge your pending sexuality based on how many musicals you've been to see this year and how much you spend on a hair cut. Given the current prominence of the internet as a tool for young people to seek advice on LGBTQ issues, it's a pity and a problem that you have to wade through a vast sea of prejudice, which can often make it impossible to locate legitimate sources of support.Research carried out in 2012 by Stonewall revealed that 99% of students had heard the word 'gay' being used in a negative way. The study also found that 23% (almost a quarter) of young lesbian, gay and bisexual people had tried to take their own life at some point. When you compare this to the percentage of all young people who have attempted suicide (7% - Samaritans research) it is clear to see that whatever work is being done to support LGBTQ young people, it's simply not enough.The environment in many schools is not indicative of a secure and supportive learning space, as students can feel rejected by a curriculum that appears to be non-inclusive. This in turn, creates a taboo in society where young people struggling to come to terms with their sexuality are segregated and forced to seek information elsewhere.At the age of 19 I came out. Despite having had a strong idea of my sexual orientation since 15, the stigma around being gay as well as the stereotypical representation of gay men in the media made it impossible for me to comfortably identify as a gay person. I approached a local LGBT-friendly football team and from there, was able to meet like-minded individuals with whom I shared similar interests. I was greeted by a sense of inclusion that developed into some very strong friendships. Being a part of the Youth Volunteering Programme with Stonewall has been an excellent opportunity for me to make a positive change in my community. Working closely with local schools to identify homophobic bullying and language, I learned several things about how young people can get a better understanding of how to embrace their sexuality without being subject to discrimination. In schools, some teachers aren't sure how they should respond to homophobic language and some student intolerance is a result of the lack of information about the effects that homophobic bullying (there is a distinct lack of teaching in the curriculum on sexual identity). Consequently, the lack of information that teachers receive results in students not having access to valuable knowledge. Training should be sought by schools and provided by outside sources that have experience in tackling homophobic bullying. This would then help aid and avoid isolation of students that identify themselves as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.For those who are in the process of discovering their orientation or sexual identity, there are networks available that can offer support and guidance. Websites like Young Stonewall  offer a regional database of LGBTQ organisations, and Stonewall will be launching their Coming Out Guide for Young People at their annual Education for All conference on July 4 in London, which will subsequently be available to download for free from the website. Alternatively, a lot of young people who are stuggling to come to terms with their sexuality may prefer more general sources of support such as Childline.Coming out isn't always easy, but as clichéd as it sounds, talking to friends and family does make the process a lot less daunting. Personally, after coming out to one friend, I was much more confident repeating the process as many times as I needed to.In all honesty, coming out opened doors to so many different experiences and opportunities. If I was still 'in the closet' I would be missing out on chances that I may not have previously been able to access. The best advice I can give to anyone who is thinking about coming out is that no matter what sexuality or gender you identify with, there is always support available for those who seek it.",2014-05-17T07:32:00Z,Advice for teens coming out,,80,"<p>To celebrate anti-homophobia day, Stonewall's Young Campaigner of the Year 2014 has some advice for teens thinking about coming out, or interested in what the process is really like</p>",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/14/1400056228129/Michael-Young-and-Sir-Ian-006.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/may/17/lgbt-teens-coming-out,1
"The Boy Scouts of America (BSA) are on track to allow gay and lesbian leaders into the organization, after an executive committee approved a resolution that would eliminate the standing ban against such adults.    Related: Boy Scouts president: ban on gay scout leaders an 'unsustainable position'    Under the newly adopted resolution, BSA rules would allow people to be troop leaders regardless of their sexuality. The organization’s National Executive Board is set to ratify the resolution on 27 July and comments made by the BSA president, Robert Gates, in May indicate that it is likely to push the policy change through.  Gates told a crowd at the BSA meeting in Atlanta that if the organization upholds its ban on gay leaders, it “will be the end of us as a national movement”. He said the changing national climate toward LGBT rights and mounting legal challenges against BSA because of the ban left the organization with few other options.  This issue was reinforced in Monday’s announcement, which also clarified that religious-chartered groups can “continue to choose adult leaders whose beliefs are consistent with their own”. In May 2014, BSA announced that it would accept openly gay young males into the programme, but reinforced its ban on LGBT adults. Despite this, groups in New York and Colorado allowed gay and lesbian scout leaders.  If the resolution is adopted as described in BSA documents, leaders who were previously removed because of their sexuality could reapply for their positions.  The Scouts for Equality executive director, Zach Wahls, who has been a leader in the movement to change the policy, celebrated the vote on Monday.  “For decades, the Boy Scouts of America’s ban on gay adults has stood as a towering example of explicit, institutional homophobia in one of America’s most important and recognizable civic organizations,” he said in an emailed statement.  “While this policy change is not perfect – BSA’s religious chartering partners will be allowed to continue to discriminate against gay adults – it is difficult to overstate the importance of today’s announcement.”",2015-07-13T22:30:27Z,Boy Scouts on track to change policy and allow gay and lesbian troop leaders,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""f079f094f3fe7ee7f7b7fcd64e62de85f5e5cb05""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/f079f094f3fe7ee7f7b7fcd64e62de85f5e5cb05/0_69_5184_3114/1000.jpg"" alt=""Boy Scouts"" width=""1000"" height=""601"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts prepare to lead marchers at the Pride Parade on 28 June in Seattle. </span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Elaine Thompson/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>",81,"Under a resolution newly adopted by the BSA’s executive committee, organization rules would allow people to be troop leaders regardless of sexuality",http://media.guim.co.uk/f079f094f3fe7ee7f7b7fcd64e62de85f5e5cb05/0_69_5184_3114/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/13/boy-scouts-lgbt-troop-leaders,0
"Have you ever let a sexist remark go unchallenged at work? Most women, I’d wager, have. What about several comments? What, in fact, would or could you do if you found your workplace culture was steeped in sexism? This autumn marks five years since the Equality Act was passed – an all-encompassing bill taking in older acts concerning pay, race, gender and disability discriminations – making our right to work free from prejudice enshrined in the law. The tricky part is that it’s often hard to implement. With the lack of an obvious offence, it’s often a case of being crushed by a thousand tiny micro-aggressions; they can be hard to prove, both to an employer and to yourself, contributing to a feeling of slow-burning madness: am I imagining this? Can this be a problem with me, or the other person? To preserve sanity, it’s often easier to quit a job than deal with the labour-intensive process of pursuing a grievance. But not being able to impact on a toxic workplace environment, to subvert and change from within, can be a concern that many women share when leaving a sexist workplace. Compounding the feeling of failure on leaving is the awareness that remaining or future female employees will face the same treatment. Charlotte Songhurst (not her real name), 31, taught PE at a secondary school in the south-east from 2005 to 2010. She returned from maternity leave to find her department dominated by a new male teacher who had helped foster a culture of sexist jokes and bad language. Songhurst claims that he was unable to take orders from female colleagues, leading to a standoff between the two where he shouted and physically intimidated her. She quit. “I felt I’d let myself down by not challenging it,” she says. “Now I’m older and stronger, I wish I had done more. But at the time I was broken – he systematically chipped away at me.” Many women I spoke to about why they left sexist workplaces never spoke out for themselves or their successors thanks to a suffocating combination of imposter syndrome (feelings of professional inadequacy, despite evidence of your accomplishments), the potential of being dismissed for being “emotional”, and fear of upsetting an established workplace culture. Often, they would be reporting to female-dominated HR departments that would report to male-dominated senior management, leading to weak responses to their complaints. The self-preservation act of leaving is curdled by a sense of desertion for letting the status quo stand.   Related: 10 sexist scenarios that women face at work    Earlier this year, Mel Chillag, 27, worked at a leading supermarket in the north-east, and describes an air of “general misogyny” among her predominantly male colleagues: jokes about rape and murder, sexist and demeaning comments about their girlfriends. “I came on shift one night to find an article pinned up discussing comments from the company’s CEO, encouraging fat employees to lose weight so they looked more attractive to customers and were able to work more efficiently,” she says. “I had to assume this was a passive aggressive attack on me due to being the only fat person working there.” As a newcomer, Chillag felt uncomfortable raising the issue. She finally got the opportunity at a review, but was left feeling unsupported. Eventually, she decided to leave. Once the relief subsided, she experienced “a sense of guilt and disappointment that I didn’t do more to challenge the culture,” she recalls. “I left without saying a word, and I have no doubt that, unchallenged, the perpetrators will continue to speak about women with total disdain. It should have been my duty to be the one who spoke out.” The danger is that women internalise this kind of responsibility. Dr Elisabeth Kelan, professor of leadership at Cranfield School of Management, finds that women leaving sexist workplaces often deny discrimination, preferring to regard themselves as the problem. “We’re always told it’s our skill, our ability,” she says, emphasising the importance of recognising that so much work is “based on this behaviour that excludes others.” Sophie, 33, asked to withhold her surname: in her experience, female employees were often burdened with the responsibility of managing their aggressor. Her digital role at a charity threatened a male employee, whose behaviour escalated from pointedly ignoring her to taking a red pen to her job description in a meeting organised by HR. A third-party mediator concluded that he had a problem with women. The company paid for him to have counselling and gave him an assistant, while Sophie’s direct manager suggested she sit down with the perpetrator for a cup of tea. She, too, quit. “It’s in my nature to be someone who wants to fix things, so that led to a lot of guilt and self-doubt,” she says. “‘Is it me? Am I just shit at my job?’ I felt guilt for the girl who started as his assistant – she flashed up on LinkedIn and I wondered if I should contact her. I didn’t.” Dr Jo Grady, a lecturer in human resource management at the University of Leicester School of Management, is concerned by the guilt that women leaving these workplaces feel. “There is a lot of empowerment literature that would suggest that individual behaviours can help overcome power structures when it comes to gender in the workplace,” she says. “There’s only an extent to which that will ever be successful.” Her research concerns organisations being structured around hetero-patriarchal values: “The idea of a heterosexual full-time worker, who enters the market at a certain period in time and doesn’t have many career breaks, is what most HR departments base their idealised worker on.” Never mind anti-discrimination legislation – the system, she says, is rigged in men’s favour. Ruth Cornish, founder of HR consultancy Amelore, suggests harnessing any widespread dissatisfaction to make a collective grievance, though she says making your move after leaving can be powerful: meeting with company directors, or engaging an external party – who doesn’t have to deal with the resulting office politics – to make CEOs aware of poor practice, though she acknowledges that comes at a personal cost. She estimates that 80% of her clientele want to improve life for their successors (men, too, aggrieved by inflexibility or macho environments): the key to doing so is identifying an organisation’s weak spot. “A big supermarket is not going to want a reputation for tribunals. It’s about spotting that and thinking about how you can influence it.” That’s the dream Clara Summers (not her real name), 33, clings to as she contemplates quitting her job in events at a Copenhagen bar, where a “bro-centric” atmosphere means that, as the only woman in the management team, she is handed all the menial tasks. A superior said she was “too sensitive” when she raised the matter. When she recently refused to add more jobs to her workload, her boss told her to do them anyway “to keep the boys happy”.

"The cyclical focus on each presidential candidate’s medical records – which has begun in earnest with Hillary Clinton this week and extended to Jeb Bush’s diet – is a political charade designed to allow their opponents to mine for political cudgels what in any other circumstance would be appropriately confidential medical records. But electing a president who later dies in office or becomes physically incapable of serving in the role is an entirely possible and provided-for (if not predictable) circumstance of the US political system, and no amount of listing candidates’ colonoscopy results will prevent it. To date, eight American presidents – 18% – have died in office: four as a result of violence, and four from natural causes. If past performance were an accurate predictor of future results, those aren’t, one might say, the best odds; but then, medical science provides us with no surety. To poorly paraphrase Ben Franklin, one of the only certainties in life is that we’re all going to die – and that most of us will have no say in when or how. The writers and amenders of our constitution anticipated that some of our heads of state would die in office, providing first for the office of a vice president with virtually no other responsibilities than to step into a dead man’s shoes, and then for the US Congress to figure it out if that didn’t work; the President Succession Act of 1947 currently delineates that, if the president and vice president are unable to serve, it will fall first to the speaker of the House of Representatives and then to the longest-serving member of the majority party in the US Senate. The 25th amendment, adopted in 1967, even provides for what will happen if the president is only temporarily incapacitated. We expected it to happen; it has happened; we created a system to deal with it when it does happen. And nothing in life – especially life itself – is guaranteed. So there’s no reason pretend that perusing a presidential candidate’s medical records will obviate the need for a vice presidential candidate to move into the Oval Office. You could blame our voracious appetite for the most intimate of medical details from our political candidates, as many do, on 1972 presidential candidate George McGovern and his short-lived vice presidential nominee, then-Senator Thomas Eagleton. Eagleton – in a period in which both having mental health issues and seeking appropriate treatment for them were even more stigmatized than they are today – was forced to withdraw his nomination after his political enemies made sure the American public knew about (and looked down on) his condition and his decision to seek treatment. It was, his detractors said at the time, a matter of whether Eagleton would again get depressed and nuke the crap out of Russia – an accusation it’s now hard to take seriously, but which may have contributed to McGovern’s eventual loss in the general election in 1972. (And, as late as 1997, no less than the New York Times – the paper of record in a city notoriously filled with people seeking psychiatric and psychological care – was publishing letters stating that Eagleton’s mental illness should’ve disqualified him from office.) Or you could blame the veneer of respectability afforded our gawking on the persistent rumors that President Ronald Reagan, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2004, had symptoms of dementia as early as 1984 or 1986. But Alzheimer’s, unlike depression, could seriously incapacitate a head of state by affecting his judgment and memory and, despite that possibility, Reagan’s well-being was hardly at issue in the 1984 campaign or used to attack his presidency while he remained in office. In modern American life, the Americans With Disabilities Act, the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (Hipaa) privacy rule, the 2008 Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (Gina) and many state laws either outright forbid (potential) employers from asking about or finding out employees’ medical histories or forbid them from discriminating against those people who choose to disclose their medical conditions in order to seek reasonable accommodations in the workplace. (AOL CEO Tim Armstrong found that out the hard way back in 2014, though the employees whose medical conditions he disclosed never filed suit.) But somehow it’s supposed to matter if President Obama still has the occasional cigarette or how hard Hillary Clinton really hit her head before the Benghazi hearings. The calls for candidates to release their medical records aren’t an attempt to assure the American people that the candidate will survive a four-year term if elected – no one can guarantee that. But it is an opportunity for a would-be president’s opponents and detractors to dig through the most intimate details of his or her life in order to take advantage of existing stigmas under the guise of transparency.  Goodness knows the Babygate proponents in 2008 weren’t interested in whether Sarah Palin’s running habits were a put-on or not: they wanted to know, in more detail than they received, about the contents of her uterus in order to persuade Americans that she was lying about the parentage of her youngest child. (She was not. And it was absurd to suggest that she was.) Does anyone seriously believe that the same people who have hounded Clinton for two decades wouldn’t love a go at her gynecological records? Is it germane to a candidate’s fitness for office if he sought treatment for, say, cocaine abuse in the 80s? Are records of a man’s hair plugs fair game? A Viagra prescription? If someone wants to Bomb bomb bomb, bomb bomb Iran, do we need to make sure that’s depression talking rather than just an abhorrent neoconservative ideology? Speculating about it has gained traction because it’s worked, and the sleaziest of campaign operatives hopes it will again. But let those who have never contracted HPV – that’s less than 20% of sexually active adults in the US – and who floss every day cast the first stone: humans are dirty, messy, disease- and infection-prone, and few of us do all that we should to lead healthy lives (and then we die, often suddenly). Medical privacy encourages medical honesty, and honesty with your doctor is a key factor in maintaining your health or identifying disease early.  Let’s let the candidates have most of their privacy back; goodness knows a few of them would probably benefit from the care of a competent mental health professional and I, for one, would like them to get it without worrying that we’ll judge them for it.",2015-08-07T15:15:05Z,Medical records must stay private - even for prospective presidents,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""bfa28675e14a7ec2a6beba30309452fe402aeed5""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/bfa28675e14a7ec2a6beba30309452fe402aeed5/0_315_2636_1581/1000.jpg"" alt=""Obama basketball"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Obama plays basketball.

"    The panellists debate same-sex marriage. Link to video    The public overwhelmingly backs same-sex marriage and Tony Abbott should “get it done quickly and move on”, Richard Di Natale has said in his first outing on the ABC’s Q&amp;A as the federal Greens leader. Claims of discrimination at the heart of Australia’s marriage debate – against opponents of same-sex marriage, that is – took centre stage in Monday’s episode, which also touched on Dyson Heydon, tax and how to boost the number of women in parliament.   Related: Referendum or plebiscite? There's a simpler way for the public to have their say on marriage equality | Nathan Elvery    Di Natale said any plebiscite on marriage equality needed to happen at the next election, with a question set by parliament, not by Tony Abbott. “We can’t let the prime minister make a captain’s call on this,” he said. But he added: “I just think we should have a vote of the parliament. We could get it done so quickly and move on.” Liberal MP Kelly O’Dwyer, a vocal supporter of marriage equality, agreed. “The truth is I would have favoured a free vote,” she said, pointing out that George Brandis had explicitly ruled out the need for a referendum. “It has been made very clear by the attorney general, who is our first law officer of this nation, that in fact that’s not required in order to change the Marriage Act. I think a plebiscite is the right way to go,” she said. Playing the contrarian was Brendan O’Neill, the editor of online libertarian magazine Spiked, who decried the “ugly, intolerant streak” he saw in same-sex marriage proponents. “Anyone who opposes [same-sex marriage] is demonised, harassed, we have seen people thrown out of jobs because they criticise gay marriage, people rejected from polite society,” he said. One such victim was Tony Abbott, he said, who struggled under the yoke of this “21st century form of religious persecution”. “[Abbott] clearly has a problem with gay marriage but can’t articulate it because we live in a climate where it is not acceptable,” O’Neill said. Katy Faust, a US writer who was raised by two women but nonetheless opposes marriage equality, argued that advocates of the status quo needed to cease making religious arguments and “do a better job of making our case using natural law”. “Our side needs to make convincing secular arguments using social science and natural law,” she said. Faust, who pens a blog with the ironic title Ask the Bigot, complained that opponents of same-sex marriage were too often caricatured as homophobes. “What that does is it shuts down a real robust debate. In our country, we didn’t have one,” she said.  “It was so demonised from the beginning that anybody that supported traditional marriage was doing so based on bias or bigotry or hatred or homophobia. It totally shut it down and people felt like they could not speak up.” Labor senator Sam Dastyari was scathing, telling Faust: “I found it very hard to respect your views because I don’t think it comes from a place of love ... That American evangelical clap-trap is the last thing we need in the debate.” He was just as fiery on the question of Dyson Heydon, the royal commissioner on the ropes over plans to address a Liberal party fundraiser. “Frankly, as far as I’m concerned, that disqualifies him and he should resign,” Dastyari said. O’Dwyer said Heydon’s record was “unimpeachable” and accusations of bias “a pretty outrageous slur on somebody who is an eminent jurist”. O’Neill shrugged, declaring the affair “a really rubbish scandal”. “I mean there are no prostitutes, there’s no drugs, there’s not even any booze,” he said. He went further, declaring “we should get rid of” royal commissions altogether (“Tell all the people who have suffered childhood sexual abuse,” Di Natale said). Nor did O’Neill pull any punches on the topic of targets for women in politics, which he said were “terrible”. “Women will never know if they were selected on the basis of merit or biology,” he said. O’Dwyer disagreed: “We need to see more women in the parliament and only by having a target can you measure your progress.” The mention of merit in the government’s ranks set up Di Natale nicely. “I think it was Tony Abbott who said his frontbench was selected on merit. I have worked very closely with some of that frontbench,” he said. “I can tell you merit was the last thing that got most of them there.”",2015-08-17T20:21:38Z,"Q&A: discrimination on same-sex marriage cuts both ways, panel says",,85,Libertarian Brendan O’Neill and US blogger Katy Faust put the case that proponents of traditional marriage are silenced by intolerance and prejudice,http://media.guim.co.uk/03cd9d146b65f79928d3b9e481b3635fcd925f1d/2070_558_1820_1093/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/aug/18/qa-discrimination-same-sex-marriage-cuts-both-ways,2
"As I watched Jennicet Gutiérrez open her mouth to interrupt President Obama’s Pride Month reception address Wednesday night – because, she said, as an undocumented trans woman she couldn’t celebrate while LGBT detainees are being abused in US detention centers – I thought, That could have been me.  I could see myself as a transgender US immigrant in a roomful of LGBT people, wanting to celebrate the president’s actions to advance the cause of gay marriage, trans healthcare and trans people serving in the military, but being unable to shut my mouth because of the deplorable conditions that undocumented LGBT immigrants, especially trans women, face. Trans women in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention are routinely housed with men and are either at enormous risk of sexual assault, sometimes by ICE guards themselves, or are placed in solitary confinement for months for their own “safety” – all after already enduring violence in their own countries that led them to seek asylum. So when Gutiérrez shouted, “President Obama, I am a trans woman. I’m tired of the abuse. I’m tired of the violence,” she was advocating for an issue that cuts to the heart of what it means for a person to be treated with basic human dignity, regardless of immigration status. President Obama’s response was bracing as it was heartless, especially being the child of one non-American himself. “Listen, you’re in my house,” he said. And later: “I am just fine with a few hecklers, but not when I’m up in the house. You know what I mean? You know, my attitude is if you’re eating the hors d’oeuvres – you know what I’m saying?” Obama’s argument seems to be that if you’re invited to a party, it’s only polite not to criticize the host; I try to follow this rule myself. But when the host is in charge of a system that leads to members of a community he’s supposed to be celebrating being routinely abused and assaulted, and he has so far taken little action to address it, then breaking this rule is justified. More than this, Obama’s emphasis on defining the fine food and drink at the event as his property only serves to highlight the lack of dignity LGBT detainees endure simply through their accident of birth – that American society can shower resources on its citizens while leaving those who are attempting to enter the country in desperation without the most basic physical and psychological safety. And LGBT detainees merely represent the most extreme ways in which some people are treated unequally in the US.  Trans people, and especially trans women of color, have to endure all sorts of indignities in US institutions and broader society. Trans immigrants like me are especially vulnerable, as we endure the constant threat not only of being housed in male prisons – even as many of us are arrested simply for walking on the street – but also of travel restrictions when we cannot provide identification consistent with our gender, must endure harassment by government officials and live with the consistent threat of deportation (which applies even to legal residents). The disparity in treatment of ICE detainees also highlights the enormous gap between the white, gay segment of the LGBT population and their trans people of color counterparts. The crowd at Obama’s Pride Reception, consisting mostly of white men in suits, amplified the President’s message by booing Gutiérrez and shouting Obama’s name, enacting in real time the long, historical marginalization of trans women of color. It’s been happening since at least the Stonewall Riots that ushered the modern LGBT movement, where organizers kicked out trans activist Sylvia Rivera, a founding member. For so many gay people today, LGBT advocacy stops at gay marriage, even as members of our community are routinely subject to harassment and violence, both in detention and outside. In one of the videos of the incident Wednesday, a bystander could be heard shouting, “This is not for you. This is for all of us,” as though “all of us” doesn’t actually include everyone – people like Gutierrez, or me are left out of that definition of “us”. The bystander could not have known what an enormous risk Gutiérrez took by daring to question the president of the country where she is an undocumented immigrant. And nevermind that she was careful to repeatedly say, “Release all LGBT prisoners from detention centers,” not just trans prisoners, or that she’s advocating not for herself but for people confined merely because they were so desperate to seek asylum from horrendous conditions in their home countries. The gay men at Obama’s reception also seem to forget that their predecessors only 30 years ago needed to set aside good manners as they faced down Ronald Reagan about the AIDS crisis that was killing them in droves.  The circumstances may be different, but the desperation that drove Gutiérrez to speak is the same, and it is the same for anyone who sees other human beings treated inhumanely by a president and a government that has the ability and the power to do otherwise. In this sense, Gutiérrez was not acting for herself, for trans women or for the LGBT community, but for all of us. We all, at any moment, can find ourselves in a situation where we are robbed of our basic human dignity – even if, occasionally, we’re invited to partake of powerful people’s hors d’oeuvres.",2015-06-25T18:34:17Z,Obama's reply to a trans woman proves LGBT advocacy stops at gay marriage,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""ec4720d1ea67a2a38b034f4be0654a0acf0e40e7""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/ec4720d1ea67a2a38b034f4be0654a0acf0e40e7/422_83_2513_1507/1000.jpg"" alt=""pride dinner"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Keep talking, Jennicet Gutiérrez.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>",86,‘You’re eating my hors d’ oeuvres’ is hardly a response to a trans community that is routinely subject to harassment and violence,http://media.guim.co.uk/ec4720d1ea67a2a38b034f4be0654a0acf0e40e7/422_83_2513_1507/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/25/obamas-reply-to-a-trans-woman-proves-lgbt-advocacy-stops-at-gay-marriage,6
"The Labour deputy leadership candidate Angela Eagle has called for the party to be bolder in pushing people from diverse backgrounds into prominent and powerful posts. Eagle, who became Britain’s first openly gay female MP when she came out in 1997, said Labour had often made principled yet unpopular decisions to improve the lives of women, people from ethnic minorities and the LGBT community, only to see the Conservatives “grab the glory” once public opinion had shifted. Her comments will be seen as a way of forcing the issues of diversity and representation into the deputy leadership race. She is one of three female candidates for the role and is the only out lesbian. Eagle said Labour should grab back the agenda of minority rights and that her election would help “smash the glass ceiling” for LGBT people. “Diversity is an important part of what the Labour party stands for. But it is obvious that we do not always get the credit for the work that we do. People talk about Margaret Thatcher being the first female prime minister, but we could easily have had a first female prime minister in Barbara Castle. “And there is a pattern. We as a party have laid much of the groundwork on women’s issues, on LGBT issues and on the representation of BAME people. We have forced through laws which were unpopular at the time, and made stands on principle because we believed in them.”   Related: Eagle sisters fly high at Westminster    Eagle welcomed David Cameron’s decision to argue in favour of gay marriage, but said it was Labour that stuck to its principles before LGBT rights were widely acknowledged. “We came into government in 1997 with an agenda of LGBT rights. We did all the heavy lifting when it wasn’t popular. When we repealed Section 28 [in 2003], there were few Tories who agreed with us. “We should be bolder about speaking about our success on these issues and pushing people from more diverse backgrounds into influential positions. I hope I demonstrate by example that it is important.” Eagle, the MP for Wallasey, said she would welcome an influx of LGBT supporters, or their financial support, as part of her campaign to become deputy leader. “I would always encourage people to join the party. If a quarter of a million LGBT people get involved, that would be good.” Eagle was one of the youngest MPs in parliament when she was first elected in 1992 at the age of 31. Since then, she has been a minister and shadow minister in four different departments, been the vice-chair of the parliamentary Labour party, and chaired party conference, Labour’s national executive committee, and its national policy forum. She has been at the forefront of the argument for quotas within the party and scored notable successes when tackling the Tories from the floor of the house. After challenging the prime minister over NHS reforms, he was roundly criticised for telling her to “calm down, dear”. Her decision to stand as deputy leader has been welcomed by many old hands within the party, who believe she has managed the Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband regimes with humour and loyalty. Eagle expressed her regret at the party’s failure to put forward a single BAME candidate in the current leadership and deputy leadership campaigns. Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, pulled out of the leadership contest within days of announcing that he was going to run, citing personal reasons and the unexpected level of media attention. Rushanara Ali dropped out of the deputy leadership campaign last week after it became clear that there were too many candidates for each to achieve the 35 votes needed from MPs.   Related: I have fought against the odds and won, and I will do so again for Labour | Rushanara Ali    Eagle said the party’s rules may need to be re-examined if it is to bring in more candidates from different backgrounds.  “It is unfortunate that we have no one from a BAME background in either election. Things are changing in the party, but not fast enough. “Rushanara did a very selfless thing. She wanted to open up a narrow choice and so she stepped down. It became narrow because each candidate needed so many nominations from MPs. We may need to look at the voting system again.” Stella Creasy, Ben Bradshaw and Eagle made it on to the ballot having been on 31, 28 and 25 nominations respectively. Caroline Flint qualified comfortably with 41.

"“Moscow is like a small European city in the mid-90s,” says Anton Krasovsky. “Everybody knows everybody. Everybody knows who’s gay, even if nobody’s out.” Well, not nobody. In 2013, when the Duma was debating a new law outlawing “gay propaganda”, Krasovsky was a beloved Russian TV personality, working for a news channel he’d co-founded called Kontr TV. At the end of a wide-ranging discussion on the proposed legislation, Krasovsky said, on air: “I’m gay. And I’m just as much a human being as President Putin, or Prime Minister Medvedev, or the members of the Duma.” Less than a week later, Krasovsky was no longer working for Kontr TV, the clip was removed from the archives and his face had been scrubbed from the website. And yet ask him and his friends what it’s like to be gay in Moscow and they shrug. “Moscow attracts gay men from all the villages, so there are more gay people in Moscow than anywhere else in Russia. And they all just want what everyone else wants: somebody to love.”     Journalists Anton Krasovsky and Tatyana Felgengauer at the Edward Snowden Internet Media Awards in 2014 in Moscow. Photograph: TASS/Barcroft Media    Moscow is, indeed, gayer than you might think. There might not be many dedicated gay clubs – the five-floor behemoth of Central Station being a notable exception – but many bars and restaurants have gay nights, from Cafe Mart to Mono to the famous Sunday discos at Propaganda. When it comes to clubbing, at least, the biggest concern for gay men in Moscow isn’t prejudice but what Russians call “face control”, which the Daily Beast describes as “knowing the right people – or having the right look”. There’s a gay magazine, Kvir (say it out loud) with listings and frothy lifestyle features: more Out than Advocate. With all the media furore over rising anti-LGBT activity in Russia in recent years, it can be a surprise to see how pink the capital feels in some places. “As if I’m so old to know about that!” bristles Tim, 22, a model agent having a drink at Sanctions Bar, when asked if gay life has got harder in Moscow over the last five years. “But no, it is getting better here. Of course I am out because I work in fashion – most people in my office are gay – but I have to hide it from other people. But there are more gay nights and I think things are improving.”  Sanctions Bar itself – a semi-ironic anti-western theme bar decorated with oil drums, dollar bill toilet paper and a menu featuring Barack Obama’s face crossed out – has just recently started dabbling in attracting a gay clientele. Tim is wearing a blue ribbon on his wrist. “A white ribbon means single, red means in a relationship and blue means flirting. They made us choose one. I didn’t really want to.” There might not be much in the way of Russian public media celebrating gay life, but Tim watches the E network and the Kardashians and considers New York his spiritual home. “Still, my dream is to be able to walk down the street holding my partner’s hand. I don’t think that will ever happen in Moscow.” Andrey, 27, an engineer, is one of those “gay men from the villages”. Born in Grozny and raised in a village near Moscow, he moved to the capital at 21, drawn by the Eurovision song contest that Russia hosted in 2009. “Of course I was immediately very excited in Moscow,” he said over a coffee on a sunny June afternoon in the rear courtyard of Cafe Mart, next to Moscow’s Museum of Modern Art. “In Grozny I had to keep it a secret from my parents and my friends. But of course I needed to meet men, to have boyfriends and to have sex.”      A hacked version of Grindr showing user profiles located within the walls of the Kremlin. Photograph: Global Voices via Americablog.com    Andrey used apps, but on moving to Moscow found he didn’t need to be quite so discreet any more – although he’s still in the closet at work. “It makes me uncomfortable when men talk about women. A colleague asked me which of the girls at the office I’d like to hook up with. I said I don’t date in the workplace.”  Apps have made being gay in Moscow a lot easier. Grindr is ever popular – a hacked location file revealed several users within the walls of the Kremlin itself – but Hornet is increasingly used because of the fact you can have public images as well as private ones, revealed only on request. Reports of anti-LGBT activists setting up fake accounts to lure and then abuse gay men (sometimes recording it on video) have made Andrey and his friends more cautious. “I don’t invite men on apps to my house. We meet up, have a conversation, go for a walk.” He doesn’t reveal his sexuality in public. “With apps, you often find friends on there who you didn’t know were gay. Then you can reveal yourself to them. In public, it’s dangerous if you’re not sure. Some men are gay but deny it.” He starts listing some famous public figures.     There are so many gay women in Moscow – we’re everywhere these days  Nastya Laut     There are fewer events catering for lesbians in Moscow, but that doesn’t mean they don’t exist. Among the most popular are women-only parties named after the US television series The L Word, run by 29-year-old Karina Krasavina. L Word takes place every two weeks at a club in the city centre, and will be celebrating its sixth birthday this weekend. Krasavina said she has never had any trouble from the authorities. Her business partner, 24-year-old Nastya Laut, laughed off any safety concerns. “There are so many gay women in Moscow – we’re everywhere these days,” she said. “It’s become normal. Sure, there are people who don’t understand or who are negative, but most are fine with it. My family are fine with it and my friends are fine with it and I never feel that I’m in danger. We just have a good time.” But LGBT activist and journalist Elena Kostyuchenko said not all homosexual women are able to be so open. She said that even the venues catering for gay women often choose not to advertise their orientation.      Pop king Philipp Kirkorov at the Elena Souproun fashion in Moscow in 2013. Photograph: Pascal Le Segretain    “Many of the LGBT clubs look like a normal restaurants during they day - people come to have business lunches or whatever. Then only at night do they become an LGBT club. So even the venues have a double life,” she said.  The lesbian scene has shrunk in recent years, with many of the more active members emigrating because of the government’s anti-gay agenda. “Lots of venues have closed down, I don’t even know where people go these days,” said Kostyuchenko. But she stressed that it is so much easier to be gay in Moscow or St Petersburg than anywhere else in Russia. “Yes, you can have difficulties and you need to be careful but it’s nothing like it is elsewhere.” Indeed, Moscow’s gay people seem more stoic than angry. They’ve even appropriated their own abuse: if something silly or stupid or weird happens in Europe, it’s derided as “Gayropa”. What concerns many homosexual Muscovites most, it seems, is less fear for their safety or inability to meet other gay men and women, than legal legitimacy – the ability to share property with a partner, or pass on inheritances without interference from grasping relatives, or raise kids. Krasovsky wants kids; his partner, who is younger, does not. Does he worry that Muscovites wouldn’t be supportive if they say two men raising a child?  “Yes, of course. But there are ways. It can be done. It’s just dangerous.”    It is better to be afraid to die, but fight anyway, than sit in a bomb shelter  Anton Krasovsky     He understands why more men aren’t out in Moscow, and while he hopes other public figures will join him, he understands the reasons they don’t. “It immediately puts you at the bottom of the food chain. You become like a migrant worker in your own country.” In general, Krasovsky wears his gay activism uncomfortably. “It’s not like in America: rah-rah, I’m so proud. In Moscow, we are more just trying to live our lives.” He self-mockingly shows me his Grindr profile: a string of messages from men, most asking: “Are you really Anton Krasovsky?”, but the occasional one saying: “It’s great to see you here.”  He might be Moscow’s highest-profile openly gay man, but seems embarrassed about his decision to come out on air, and keeps deflecting my questions to his friends. Eventually, however, he almost shyly admits that he knows exactly why he did it. “It’s scary [to come out]. Even in England, sometimes it scary to do. But it is better to be afraid to die in a battle, but go into this fight [anyway], than all your life be stupidly afraid and sit in a bomb shelter. “It’s like Pink Floyd’s The Wall … ‘new car, caviar.’ You might have that, but you still have to remember the truth. It’s pathetic, but the truth is still important.”",2015-06-13T06:00:04Z,Gay in Putin's Moscow: why the city is pinker than you think,"<figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""1f0f0a9ed38283f782da5965c7c5e9dd4c2b9821""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434130375399/f862ab90-3f4b-4a49-be48-bc934e95910a-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Russian men kiss in Moscow in 2012, a year before the 2013 law banning 'gay propaganda'."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Russian men kiss in Moscow in 2012, a year before the 2013 law banning ‘gay propaganda’.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>",88,"LGBT nights are easy to find and Grindr reaches into the heart of the Kremlin itself.

"American civil liberties groups who once backed Barack Obama’s plan to sign an executive order that would prohibit discriminatory hiring practices by government contractors are withdrawing their support as pressure builds for the president to include a religious exemption.  Obama’s order would require government contracts to adhere to non-discriminatory hiring practices when it comes to people’s sexual orientation or gender identity. A law that would prohibit such discrimination in nearly every organization. The Employment Nondiscrimination Act (Enda), has stalled in Congress since it passed the Senate last year, prompting Obama to say last month he was considering the executive order. After last week’s supreme court decision on Hobby Lobby – in which the court granted some corporations an exemption from the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) contraception mandate based on the religious beliefs of their owners – a group of conservative religious leaders sent a letter to the president requesting that his executive order grants religious groups an exemption from the anti-bias law. “We are asking that an extension of protection for one group not come at the expense of faith communities whose religious identity and beliefs motivate them to serve those in need,” the leaders said in a 1 July letter. More than 150 conservative groups sent a similar letter last month. Fearing that Obama would agree to the exemption when signing the order, on Tuesday the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) withdrew its support; it was joined by Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders, Lambda Legal, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, and Transgender Law Center. On Wednesday, the Human Rights Campaign also came out against the order.  “Enda’s discriminatory provision, unprecedented in federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination, could provide religiously affiliated organizations – including hospitals, nursing homes and universities – a blank check to engage in workplace discrimination against LGBT people,” the ACLU said. ‘“The provision essentially says that anti-LGBT discrimination is different – more acceptable and legitimate – than discrimination against individuals based on their race or sex.” A coalition of liberal-leaning religious leaders followed suit, asking Obama not to include the exemption in his executive order, saying that it would open a “Pandora’s box inviting other forms of discrimination.” “In keeping with the principle that our government must adhere to the highest standards of ethics and fairness in its own operations, we believe that public dollars should not be used to sanction discrimination,” the group said in their letter. The letter, which was signed by 101 religious leaders – including representatives of the United Church of Christ, Light of Reform Mosque, the United Methodist Church and the Central Conference of American Rabbis – said that allowing such an exemption opens such laws to even more legal disputes. “If selective exemptions to the executive order were permitted, the people who would suffer most would be the people who always suffer most when discrimination is allowed: the individuals and communities that are already marginalized,” the group said. “Increasing the obstacles faced by those at the margins is precisely the opposite of what public service can and should do, and is precisely the opposite of the values we stand for as people of faith.”",2014-07-09T18:44:11Z,Obama pressured on religious exemptions after Hobby Lobby decision,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-7cb31308-c5bd-446b-b978-51dd544cead2""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/9/1404931074295/36a21205-f2d5-48b7-94eb-990440d23908-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Hobby Lobby decision supreme court"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Requests for an executive order on religious came in the wake of the Hobby Lobby supreme court decision.

"Since we launched Secret aid worker we’ve had a number of submissions on the subject of sexual harassment and discrimination within the aid industry, an issue which it seems that the sector is only now beginning to discuss. Here are some of the stories we’ve heard in the last few months; if you have any more you can email us confidentially (see details below). Groping in close quarters “I was working with a small NGO in an emergency situation, living and working 24/7 in a compound, just the six of us – three other women, two men. One day, cooking in the kitchen, one of the guys pulls down my T-shirt to reveal my breasts. I was so shocked I didn’t know what to say. So I made a joke, saying this was something I should report to HR. He was HR. When I told a friend she advised me to report it. It took me a couple of months to do so, as the head of field office was out of the mission area, and I was uncomfortable with the potential repercussions, given our confined living/working conditions. When I finally told the head of office, the response was: ‘You must have done something to invite this. Guys don’t just do that without an invitation.’”   Related: Secret aid worker: it's one standard for local staff and another for expats    Isolation in the workplace “My current boss has completely isolated and segregated me because I requested he stop commenting on my weight and clothing. He’s just advertised the job I’ve been doing (not my current job, but the vast majority of what I currently do is in this new job description) and held secret interviews, with an all-male panel. He takes the men from my office out to lunch all the time but never includes me. He changes meeting times without telling me. He just admitted in a meeting I requested with him that the reason he’s been ignoring me, and not communicating with me unless he absolutely had to because he thought I was too sensitive and just ‘in case I took it the wrong way again and reported him’.” Systematic harassment of local staff “During my first job in the field, our HR manager systematically sexually harassed every local female staff member. After an investigation, he was confronted by an expatriate staff member. He stormed out of the office outraged only to return a couple of hours later drunk, wielding a gun and threatening to ‘kill all the white people’; a couple of whom were hiding under desks inside. Turns out, there’s no law against sexual harassment that country, so the ministry of labour wouldn’t allow us to fire him for that. Death threats are illegal though, so we finally managed to get rid of him.” Undiplomatic behaviour “I was in Sudan at a typical expat BBQ party at a house compound in Khartoum. I went inside to go to the bathroom and came out to find a dance party had started in the living room. None of my friends were inside but on came an old-school TuPac beat I grew up listening to so wandered over to the floor and started dancing. All the sudden I had the sense someone was close behind me and before I could turn around and see who it was they put their hand up my dress and tried to put their middle finger up inside me right there on the dance floor. I was so shocked I froze for a second, turned around and had no idea who the face behind me was. It turned out to be a foreign diplomat. I went outside and told two guy friends. One came and grabbed the guy and talked to him. He said “did you see the way she was dancing? She wanted it.” I talked to friends about reporting it and many who had already had bad experiences with this they dissuaded me, saying since he was a diplomat he has immunity.” Extra-marital affairs with disaster victims “I was working in Aceh, Indonesia after the tsunami. I was sharing a house with our security adviser and several other colleagues, and one day I came home unexpectedly for lunch to find him on a sofa with married member of his local staff. He was also married, with three children. She was a tsunami survivor, whose child had died in the disaster and this a strictly Muslim area. After he was gone she found out she was pregnant. Our local staff had to conspire to make sure she gave birth without her husband present, in case the child looked anything other than Indonesian. Last I heard, he was working in a new job in Jerusalem.”   Related: Secret Aid Worker: After years in the field, I've lost my compassion    Offensive Skype messaging “At a meeting I noticed the staff member to my right was having a jolly and animated Skype message conversation with another senior colleague in the room. Perhaps the two of them were merely distracted – hell, it had been a long meeting, and let’s be honest, I was stealthily reading a colleague’s conversation rather than paying full attention myself. But when I realised that the topic of such hilarity was the presentation itself – ‘Are you going to join this gender group? HAHAHA!’; ‘Gender? What about dicks? HAHAHA!’ – my heart sank and my interest grew. Gender, and any attempt to address it at work, was being mocked relentlessly by two of the most senior people in the room – on their work phones. Suitably disgusted, I decided I’d better stop reading before I feel into a deep pool of feminist despair. Unfortunately, I hadn’t quite yet turned away before my neighbour’s screen lit up with this little gem. Senior staff member A: ‘I’m having trouble concentrating anyway, looking at that cute piece of meat on your left.’ Senior staff member B: ‘I KNOW, ME TOO!’ That cute piece of meat was, it seemed, me. At that point, my LOL-ing friend must have realised I was looking (I’m sure the horror was obvious on my little meaty face) because instantly Skype was minimised, and suddenly we were both looking soberly at the BBC homepage.”   Related: Why it's time we talked about the sex lives of humanitarians    Pornography in meetings “In 2001 I was in Sierra Leone with an NGO. In one location I witnessed a high-level official openly looking at porn on his computer (including while meeting with me and another woman). We also had to take a detour on our way to the office so that his driver could drop this man’s girlfriend off at high school. When I got back to the US I reported this to the person responsible for HR for the mission. This man told me that the individual in question had a number of similar reports on his file but was still promoted repeatedly.” Do you have a secret aid worker story you’d like to tell?

"I have always been sensitive to the idea of marriage equality: my black father and white mother could not legally wed in Nebraska when they met in the 1950s, and had to go to Iowa to get married. When the Iowa courts made same-sex marriage legal in 2009, I realized that, as a gay man, I too could go to Iowa, and very few other states, to get married – just like my parents.   Related: Supreme court: gay marriage legal across the US – live updates    Friday’s US supreme court ruling in Obergefell v Hodges changes all of that: all state bans against gay or lesbian marriages are deemed unconstitutional, thereby allowing couples of the same gender to wed in all 50 states. Considering that America is still debating the role of the Confederate flag 150 years after the end of the American civil war, it is a rare and wonderful thing to see the very end of one chapter of a civil rights saga less than 50 years after the Stonewall riots marked the birth of the modern LGBT rights movement. I couldn’t be happier to see the marriage of couples like Sheila and Cathy Marino-Thomas – New Yorkers who first married Massachusetts in 2004 – finally be fully recognized. Until today, with every marriage equality win in places like Massachusetts, Iowa and New York, there had been an equivocation: a marriage recognized in one state wasn’t legal in another. My home state of California voted (while electing Barack Obama president) to deny marriage rights to same-sex couples with Prop 8. A town clerk could even try to deny rights to a same-sex couple already affirmed by a US supreme court justice. No more. “We did it, babe!” Cathy Marino-Thomas told me from Henrietta Hudson’s, a lesbian bar in Greenwich Village. “I had to down my first bottle of champagne,” she said, en route to the Stonewall Inn, where the gay rights movement blew up 46 years ago this weekend. Marriage wasn’t legal in New York state in 2009 when I was I first met Marino-Thomas, then the board president of Marriage Equality New York; it seemed so remote that our interview was titled: “Who Do We Have To Blow To Get Gay Marriage?” (Six years later, Marino-Thomas, who has kept her sense of humor through a lot of disappointment, finally told me the answer on Friday: “Justice Kennedy. And he tasted good!”)  In the intervening years, kids chained themselves to the marriage bureau and drag queens shut down Sixth Avenue in New York City in courageous, street-level protests to draw attention to the need for marriage equality. I sat with Marino-Thomas, her wife Sheila and their daughter Jacqui as they cried during the many setbacks – and I have cried with them, because their losses hurt me, too.  And on a warm night in Albany in 2011, I was in the New York senate gallery when marriage equality passed the New York legislature and Governor Andrew Cuomo signed it into law. (Brian Brown, the leader of the anti-gay – and now completely pointless – organization Nation for Marriage bawled his head off with disappointment, and I couldn’t have enjoyed myself more.) I witnessed 11 same-sex weddings the first day of gay nuptials a month later, as New York state opened government offices on a Sunday to allow couples to finally marry, and was especially touched to be asked by a lesbian who had been at the Stonewall riots to sign her marriage license as a witness. There was then still a long way to go: the United States government did not recognize New York’s or any state’s same-sex marriages. But Edith Windsor, an octogenarian widow who was given a hefty tax bill after her wife, Thea Spyer, died, was about to help change all that. The thought that same-sex marriage would be legalized by the conservative-leaning Roberts court was still so transgressive that most of the LGBT organizations didn’t want to help her. (Windsor was no stranger to transgression: during the four decades that she and Spyer spent together, Windsor wore a brooch instead of a ring to symbolize her love for Spyer so that people wouldn’t know she was a lesbian, as she could have been legally fired if they did – which is still true for most LGBT people in most states today.) It was another honor to watch Windsor’s case argued in federal court, to ask her about her disdain for Republicans who wanted her to pay more taxes after her first federal victory, and to interview her about the meaning of love after her ultimate victory at the US supreme court in 2013.   Related: Supreme court's gay marriage ruling: a day of elation, but decades of activism    But even after Windsor’s win and the simultaneous decision to strike down Prop 8, legal confusion remained about the rights of same-sex couples to marry. Friday’s ruling ends that confusion, at least in a legal sense – but the history of interracial marriage in America suggests that there might be some extra-legal holdouts. Though my parents were legally wed in Iowa 1958, many states wouldn’t recognize their union until 1967, when the supreme court ruled in Loving v Virginia that all states had to recognize interracial marriages. Even then, the last state to change its laws about interracial marriage was Alabama, and that wasn’t until 2000 – and when voters decided whether or not to bring their unconstitutional law into line with the 1967 ruling, 40% voted not to do so. And marriage equality is just one front for LGBT rights: full LGBT equality, which includes economic justice, gender identity, immigration rights and racial liberation, is far from assured. HIV/Aids, still flourishing in the black gay community and ignored of late by gay rights organizations as less sexy than marriage equality, needs the robust and committed attention of the LGBT community. Jennicet Gutiérrez, the transgender woman who yelled at Barack Obama at the White House Pride reception this week, was right to harness the spirit of Stonewall in standing up for immigrant rights. Transgender Americans, the oft forgotten “T” in LGBT, have rightly been protesting their regular murder and the ways their bodies and citizenship are policed by officers and society at large. Similarly, the queer black voices from Ferguson to Baltimore have been pushing back against police brutality as our Stonewall ancestors did.  But today, one chapter in our fight is closed. Love has triumphed. Let’s enjoy the rare moment of a battle definitively won – and then, armed with love and victory, let’s march forward until there is full liberation for all of our queer brothers and sisters, married and single alike.",2015-06-26T16:59:15Z,"'We did it, babe!' – love won the day on the same-sex marriage decision","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""1bd1d5fd041a79a251eb81f3dfb7a23cb0110df4""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/1bd1d5fd041a79a251eb81f3dfb7a23cb0110df4/0_50_3971_2383/1000.jpg"" alt=""celebrate scotus"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A rare, decisive victory.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Jacquelyn Martin/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>",91,"One chapter in our fight is closed.

"With its decision to halt donations to local Boy Scout groups, Disney on Sunday joined a collection of companies to have cut ties with scouting over the organization’s ban on gay troop leaders – and made one of the first public acknowledgements of its quiet support of the LGBT community. The Disney World theme park in Orlando is home to a gay-pride event that has inspired annual protests by conservative lobby One Million Moms, and Disney has a decades-old reputation for attracting gay and lesbian employees.  “I think that the public face is where Disney is careful not to endorse any viewpoint that would come across as overtly political,” said Frommers.com editor Jason Cochran, who has written about Disney for more than a decade and authored the travel publisher’s latest Disney guide.  Since 1991, Disney World in Orlando, Florida, has been home to Gay Day, which includes pool parties, expos and scheduled days for LGBT families to attend the park with their kids. Organizers say the nearly weeklong event attracts more than 150,000 people, who can be spotted in the park wearing bright red shirts each year in June.  “Disney walks that line between endorsing [Gay Day] and benefitting from the money,” said Cochran, who noted that the company publicly supports Christian events like the park’s annual contemporary Christian music festival Night of Joy, but has never been openly supportive of Gay Day. This internal inclusivity is likely one powerful factor in Disney’s announcement that it will stop donating money to local Boy Scout troops in 2015 because of a recent revision to the organization’s attitude towards gay members. Last year, the Boy Scouts lifted a ban on gay youth members but reaffirmed its ban on gay leaders. That decision went into effect on 1 January.  Following the Boy Scouts announcement last year, numerous companies announced they would stop donations to the group. The Boy Scouts biggest corporate sponsor, Intel, said it was halting donations to local Boy Scout troops and councils because they violate the company’s “anti-discrimination” policy. Defense and aerospace company Lockheed Martin announced it would stop donating to the organization in December.  Disney did not make a formal announcement about its decision to stop funding and did not respond to requests for comment. Its decision to postpone donations to the Boy Scouts came to light after the group Scouts for Equality, which opposes the ban on gay leaders, posted a letter sent to a Florida council president from Disney about the decision. The Walt Disney Company’s charitable giving guidelines say it does not support “organizations that discriminate in the provision of services unlawfully or in a manner inconsistent with Disney’s policies on the basis of race, religion, color, sex, national origin, age, marital status, mental or physical ability, or sexual orientation.” “I think in the future – given this decision to withhold funding from the Boy Scouts – perhaps Disney is moving toward to make a more overt stamp of approval on inclusivity,” Cochran said.  Disney’s announcement comes amid a wave of rulings by federal judges saying that bans on same-sex marriage in several traditionally conservative states are unconstitutional. Last week, Arizona governor Jan Brewer vetoed an anti-gay law that prominent companies including Apple, Marriott hotels and American airlines had warned would hurt business in the state.",2014-03-03T22:17:05Z,Disney severs Boy Scout donations in show of support for LGBT rights,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-b6852021-a892-4182-beeb-c8f4179c6974""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/3/1393884527543/bb353e9d-8c2a-44df-a1aa-c18243c79c06-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""FRANCE-DISNEYLAND-TOURISM"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Disney has a decades-old reputation for attracting gay and lesbian employees.

"A politician, scientist, radio presenter and boxing promoter are among those honoured as the most influential transgender people in Britain in this year’s Pride Power list. The 2015 list, naming the most influential LGBT people and published to coincide with Pride weekend this week places people in categories, rather than ranking them, as before. Several of those in the transgender category had only spoken publicly about transitioning in the past year; they includethe radio presenter Stephanie Hirst and the boxing promoter Kellie Maloney. Others, including the model Jacqui Gavin, the vice-chair of the Civil Service network a:gender, and lawyer Stephen Whittle, are long-time activists for trans rights. Ayla Holdom, a decorated RAF flight lieutenant, who is Britain’s only openly transgender military pilot, has been honoured, as has Kate Stone, a scientist, who won her Press Complaints Commission fight against newspapers who featured her transgender status after a traumatic accident when she was gored by a stag.  In the three years since the list began, when it was ranked, American women topped it. In 2012, the actor Jane Lynch, of the TV show Glee, was named the most powerful LGBT person in the world, followed by the talkshow host Ellen DeGeneres in 2013 and Laverne Cox, the American actor, from the drama series Orange is the New Black, in 2014, the first transgender person to do so. This year’s list, compiled by SquarePeg Media via a panel and public nominations, focuses solely on influential LGBT Britons. They have been categorised into the sections of arts, campaigners, entertainers, politics, business leaders, workplace heroes, charity and community, transgender and influencers. “We haven’t numbered the entries because we see each entry as being equally important to the LGBT+ community,” the list’s authors say in their introduction. “The list serves to encompass both those fighting for equality and people who are influential role models.” Several transgender people featured are leading lights in other categories in the list. The Liberal Democrat Sarah Brown, who was the only openly transgender politician in the UK for a time, was listed in the transgender rather than politics category, but Paris Lees, a prominent trans rights activist and writer, was placed in the influencers category. The non-profit support groups Mermaids and Gender Trust, both of which deal with gender identity issues, were honoured in the charity and community section of the list.

"In France it could soon be illegal to discriminate against people in poverty. Under proposed legislation – already approved by the senate and likely to be passed by the chamber of deputies – it would be an offence in France to “insult the poor” or to refuse them jobs, healthcare or housing. Similar laws banning discrimination on the grounds of social and economic origin already exist in Belgium and Bolivia, but the French version is said to be the most far-reaching. Anyone found guilty of discrimination against those suffering from “vulnerability resulting from an apparent or known economic situation” would face a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of €45,000 (£32,000). It is easy to judge the proposed French law as showing the worst excesses of the state, or to bemoan the practicalities of how difficult it could be to implement. But most of us are content to outlaw discrimination on the grounds of race, religion, or sex. Is it so ridiculous to add poverty to that list? And if it does feel ridiculous, why is that? Whether it’s the discrimination of people in poverty or how government should respond to it, this is not a problem just for other countries. “People think that because we are poor, we must be stupid,” Oréane Chapelle, an unemployed 31-year-old from Nancy, eastern France, told Le Nouvel Observateur. Micheline Adobati, 58, her neighbour, who is a single mother with no job and five children, said: “I can’t stand social workers who tell me that they’re going to teach me how to have a weekly budget.” One study reported by The Times found that 9% of GPs, 32% of dentists and 33% of opticians in Paris refused to treat benefit claimants who lacked private medical insurance. Doctors say they are “reluctant to take on such patients for fear that they will not get paid”. Does any of this sound familiar? These are attitudes – and even outright discrimination – that have been growing in Britain for some time. You can hear it in stories about local authorities monitoring how much people drink or smoke before awarding emergency housing payments. Or when politicians respond to a national food bank crisis by saying the poor are going hungry because they don’t know how to cook. It is there in the fact that it’s now all too common for landlords to refuse to rent flats to people on benefits. Britain is front and centre of its own discrimination of the poor – whether that’s low-income workers, benefit claimants, or the recurring myth that these are two separate species. Economic inequality cannot survive without cultural prejudice. The media and political rhetoric surrounding the new round of cuts – from the benefit cap to child tax credits – shows this well enough. Benefit claimants “slouch” on handouts as hardworking taxpayers toil away to pay for them. Families on benefits should reproduce – or “breed” – as little as possible. Benefit sanctions – a system in such dire straits that Iain Duncan Smith’s own advisers have warned that it needs to be reviewed – are based on the very premise that the feckless poor need an incentive to get themselves out of poverty. It is reflective of the success of the demonisation of people on low incomes or benefits that discrimination against these people could be seen as less damning than when it happens to other groups. Equally, to believe that “the poor” do not deserve protection from such prejudice buys into the myth favoured by our own government: poverty is a personal choice that the individual deserves to be punished for.",2015-07-27T17:03:47Z,France wants to outlaw discrimination against the poor – is that so ridiculous?,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""e992000ad7467aceaa208db974801e25f47c2dfb""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/e992000ad7467aceaa208db974801e25f47c2dfb/0_232_3500_2101/1000.jpg"" alt=""poverty france discrimination ban"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Nine percent of GPs in Paris refused to treat benefit claimants who lacked private medical insurance.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Pascal Rossignol/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>",94,"In France, denying jobs, healthcare or housing to people in poverty is well on the way to becoming illegal.

"The Stonewall Inn, the bar in New York’s Greenwich Village widely considered to be the birthplace of the gay rights movement, was designated as a city landmark on Tuesday.  Following a public hearing on Tuesday morning, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission voted unanimously to designate the bar an individual landmark. Under this designation, the Stonewall Inn is guaranteed preservation and protection as a site of historical significance. “It’s great to know this iconic site is recognized and protected,” said Andrew Berman, executive director of Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, which has worked since 2014 to have the Stonewall Inn designated. The bar was the site of the Stonewall riots, a series of demonstrations by members of the LGBT community against a police raid that took place on the establishment in June 1969. The uprising inspired a new phase in the gay liberation movement, and several organizations formed nationally and internationally to promote and support LGBT civil rights – including the British gay rights lobby group Stonewall. Martin Boyce, a “Stonewall veteran”, spoke before the commission and more than 50 supporters who attended the hearing about the importance of preserving the bar as a landmark for future generations. Boyce said when he was younger resources for LGBT history and literature were scarce. “We were sneaking around for information,” he told the Guardian. He found a community within the Stonewall Inn, and participated in the riots, he said.     A sticker worn on the shirt an attendee at a New York City landmarks commission meeting. Photograph: Joseph Frederick/AP    To Boyce, now 67, the Stonewall Inn is a monument, and he said the LGBT community had few official historical monuments. “Let’s give our youths something,” he said to the commission. “We have nothing.” When asked about the riots, Boyce said: “It was brutal, but necessary. I’m glad I lived to see this. This is what we fought for, and we won our battle.” Boyce and Berman were two of more than 20 representatives, activists and community leaders who spoke in support of designating the Stonewall Inn a landmark. Many referenced Barack Obama’s second inaugural address, in which the president mentioned the Stonewall riots and placed gay rights within the context of the wider civil rights movement. Several also called upon the commission to recognize numerous other sites in New York connected to LGBT civil rights. These sites have been submitted to the commission for consideration, and include Julius Bar, the LGBT community center and the former Gay Activists Alliance Firehouse. Recounting the bar’s significant history, city council member Corey Johnson said: “History has also shown a lot happened outside the Stonewall … I think it’s important for us to give recognition to that as well, not just the inside of the bar. There are other sites that we need you as a commission to landmark.” Meenakshi Srinivasan, commission chair, said the other sites submitted for consideration are “on our radar”, and that the commission is considering them for designation. “It was very moving,” Srinivasan said of the wave of people who spoke at the hearing. “I’m pleased with the support.” The Stonewall Inn and Christopher Park, a small park in front of the bar, might also be included as a unit of the National Park Service.  The National Park Conservation Association, an advocacy group that works on behalf of the National Park Service, is hosting a meeting on Tuesday night at the LGBT Community Center to discuss the possible inclusion.

"The rainbow flag will fly over the Cabinet Office to mark this week’s gay pride celebrations, Matthew Hancock has announced, putting him at odds with his colleague, foreign secretary Philip Hammond, who refused to do the same. The Cabinet Office minister announced the decision on Twitter, posting a picture of the rainbow flag flying over the building adjacent to Downing Street on Whitehall in central London.    Proud to be flying the rainbow flag for Pride over the Cabinet Office today pic.twitter.com/Hno8UMjE4M&mdash; Matt Hancock (@MattHancockMP) June 22, 2015    Hancock, the MP for West Suffolk, said in a statement that civil servants across the country would be joining in the celebrations this week and that “flying the flag shows that pride in our LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender] community is shared at the most senior levels of Whitehall”. The announcement comes a week after Hammond was widely criticised for refusing to fly the flag over the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and forbidding British embassies abroad from flying the flag, saying it was a “longstanding policy” to fly only the union jack, national flags and the flags of overseas territories. “The union flag always takes priority and is flown from the FCO’s main flag pole at all times,” said a spokesperson for the FCO. “It is never substituted for another flag.” The FCO said on Monday that the Cabinet Office’s decision would not affect their own. Hammond’s position was a departure from that of the former foreign secretary William Hague, who agreed to the fly the flag during last year’s gay pride celebrations – which take place every year to campaign for the freedoms of LGBT people.  British embassies in Paris, Oslo, Tel Aviv and Santiago are among those to have previously flown the rainbow flag to mark their local gay pride celebrations. Hammond is one of four cabinet ministers not to have voted in favour of equal marriage, arguing that there was no demand for it and that there was “a real sense of anger among many people who are married that any government thinks it has the ability to change the definition of an institution like marriage”. Oliver Letwin, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said of the Cabinet Office’s decision: “We are delighted to join with the LGBT community in celebrating Pride this weekend, and will be flying our flag at the heart of Whitehall. We have committed to governing one nation, bringing people together and flying the flag this week shows our pride in and solidarity with the LGBT community.” The rainbow flag symbolises lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender pride. Its red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet horizontal stripes represent the diversity of the LGBT community. Thousands of people are expected to congregate in central London on Saturday for the capital’s annual gay rights parade, Pride in London. Hancock’s announcement on Twitter prompted a swift reaction from a number of Labour figures. Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant responded by asking why Hammond had forbidden embassies from raising the flag. Wes Streeting, the new MP for Ilford North and a rising star in the Labour party, said: “It would be peculiar enough for different departments to take a different approach to flying a rainbow flag, but what’s bizarre about this decision is that it reverses the position adopted by William Hague.”  Streeting, who used to be head of education at Stonewall, a leading gay rights organisation, said the inconsistency of approach sent “a worrying message to those who worried that a majority Tory government would turn the clock back on equality”. A Stonewall spokesperson welcomed the Cabinet Office’s decision to show “its support for Pride in London and the LGBT community”. “Flying the rainbow flag is really important for people to see – especially young people,” they said. “More than 75,000 young LGBT people will be bullied this year just for being who they are, so having such prominent displays of support for the LGBT community is important and very welcome.”",2015-06-22T18:01:57Z,Cabinet Office and FCO divided over flying rainbow flag,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""c014a18f807c1e0679a624a6d51e20f5d0edaa46""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/c014a18f807c1e0679a624a6d51e20f5d0edaa46/0_333_5000_3000/1000.jpg"" alt=""The rainbow flag flown in Trafalgar Square in 2013.

"The US president, Barack Obama, has launched an unprecedented defence of gay rights in Africa, telling Kenya’s president that the state has no right to punish people because of “who they love”.   Related: Obama's message of hope rings true in call for Africa to flourish    Obama, visiting his late father’s homeland for the first time as US president, confronted Uhuru Kenyatta and millions of Kenyans watching on television with his “unequivocal” views. Homosexual acts are illegal in Kenya and surveys show nine in 10 people find them unacceptable. Obama personalised the issue by comparing homophobia to racial discrimination that he had encountered in the United States. Never before has such a powerful foreign leader challenged Africans so directly on their own soil. “I’ve been consistent all across Africa on this,” he said, during a joint press conference at the state house in Nairobi. “When you start treating people differently, because they’re different, that’s the path whereby freedoms begin to erode. And bad things happen.           Barack Obama addresses the Global Entrepreneurship Summit, in Nairobi.    “When a government gets in the habit of treating people differently, those habits can spread. As an African-American in the United States, I am painfully aware of the history of what happens when people are treated differently, under the law, and there were all sorts of rationalisations that were provided by the power structure for decades in the United States for segregation and Jim Crow and slavery, and they were wrong. So I’m unequivocal on this.”   Related: Barack Obama visits Kenya - in pictures    There had been speculation that Obama would duck the issue and focus on security and trade with Kenya. But in line with his recently emboldened actions and statements on a number of topics, he pulled no punches as Kenyatta looked on in silence. He added that for “a law-abiding citizen who is going about their business, and working at a job and obeying the traffic signs and not harming anybody, the idea they will be treated differently or abused because of who they love is wrong, full stop.” The Kenyan president publicly disagreed with Obama. “There are some things that we must admit we don’t share,” Kenyatta said, insisting that gay rights “is not really an issue on the foremost mind of Kenyans”. He added: “It’s very difficult for us to impose on people that which they themselves do not accept.” There was a ripple of applause from people in the state house audience. Africa has been described as the world’s most homophobic continent with same-sex relations illegal in 36 of 54 countries and punishable by death in a handful.   Related: Barack Obama tells African states to abandon anti-gay discrimination    Obama also had firm words for Kenya on corruption, describing it as “the single biggest impediment to Kenya growing even faster”, and saying people were being “consistently sapped by corruption at a high level and at a low level.” Obama’s comments were swiftly criticised by Irungu Kang’ata, an MP in Kenyatta’s governing party. “They are in bad taste,” he said. “It’s a breach of the principle of sovereignty and equality of states. What if Kenyatta goes to America and says it should abolish the death penalty? Or for example it is like Obama goes to London or Madrid or The Hague or even Japan and says your monarchy is oppressive and a waste of money and should be done away with. In the same manner he can’t come to Kenya to tell us things that are unacceptable.”",2015-07-25T15:11:39Z,Barack Obama tells African states to abandon anti-gay discrimination,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""124b2a98297e03c1d26f021c598af0d1d01a4761""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/25/1437842463542/3a7737f9-f0e3-4ea6-8f57-63aa78166caf-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Barack Obama and Uhuru Kenyatta"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The US president, Barack Obama, left, arrives with the Kenyan president, Uhuru Kenyatta, for a bilateral meeting at State House in Nairobi on Saturday.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Simon Maina/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",97,"Visiting his father’s Kenyan homeland, US president says ‘bad things happen’ when governments get into habit of treating people differently",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/25/1437842464092/3a7737f9-f0e3-4ea6-8f57-63aa78166caf-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/25/barack-obama-african-states-abandon-anti-gay-discrimination,7
"Women returning from maternity leave are more likely to face discrimination in the workplace than they were a decade ago, according to a report published today by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The study by the EHRC estimates that around 54,000 new mothers are losing their jobs across Britain every year – almost twice the number identified in similar research undertaken in 2005. It also found that 10% of women were discouraged from attending antenatal appointments by their employers, putting the health of mother and baby at risk. Caroline Waters, deputy chair of the EHRC, said the report, Pregnancy and Maternity-Related Discrimination and Disadvantage, highlighted “worrying levels of discrimination and disadvantage at work that women still face”.  A survey of more than 3,200 women carried out by the authors of the report – produced in conjunction with the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills – found that one in nine had been dismissed, made compulsorily redundant or treated so poorly they had to quit their job. Scaled up to the general population this could mean as many as 54,000 mothers lose their jobs every year.    Related: Pregnant but screwed: the truth about workplace discrimination    The report also reveals that:  10% of women said they were treated worse by their employer after returning to work after having a baby one in five new mothers – as many as 100,000 mothers a year – experienced harassment or negative comments from colleagues, employer or manager when pregnant or returning from maternity leave 7% said they were put under pressure to hand in their notice One in 20 reported receiving a cut in pay or bonus after returning to their job.   Even when mothers were given the chance to work flexibly on their return to work, around half said it cut their work opportunities and they felt their opinion was less valued.  Justine Roberts, chief executive of parenting website Mumsnet, said women faced discrimination while pregnant and after giving birth on a regular basis. In Mumsnet’s own research, two thirds of the site’s users felt less employable after having a child and three quarters said it was harder to progress in their careers.  “Despite legislation designed to protect women from discrimination in the workplace, it’s clear that in many cases, companies are simply not following the rules,” said Roberts. “It’s shortsighted for employers to lose talented women who have built up skills and experience just because of unwillingness to support them on maternity leave and on return to work.”   Related: Workplace discrimination: when a pregnant pause becomes more long-term    Most managers surveyed by the report said they were firm supporters of female staff during and after their pregnancies, with two thirds stating they did not think pregnancy puts an unreasonable cost burden on the workplace. Four out of five believed pregnant women and new mothers were just as committed to their work as colleagues.  Rosalind Bragg, director of Maternity Action, said that David Cameron – despite promising to make Britain the most family-friendly country in Europe – had instead overseen a significant deterioration in the situation of mothers in the workplace.  “This research paints a shocking picture of the experiences of pregnant women and new mothers in the workplace,” she said. “It is unacceptable that 54,000 women each year are dismissed or bullied out of their jobs purely because they became pregnant. Action to protect women’s rights to work during their childbearing years is long overdue. The government needs to move beyond family-friendly rhetoric to delivering practical solutions to this widespread and growing problem.” Bragg called for specialist advice and support for women to pursue unfair and unlawful treatment by their employers and the scrapping of employment tribunal fees which she said “denied access to justice to the vast majority of women”. The study results were “very disturbing”, said Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives. “Evidence shows that missing antenatal appointments can increase the risk of smaller babies, premature babies, miscarriages and stillbirth,” she added. Belinda Phipps, chair of the Fawcett Society, said it was “deeply troubling” that twice as many women could be losing their jobs than a decade ago. Discrimination, she added, was “resulting in a huge loss of skills and talent from the UK workforce”.

"Twitter has apologised for hosting a frat house-themed party for its staff while the company is in the middle of a class-action lawsuit for gender discrimination. The party was held on Tuesday by one of Twitter’s San Francisco-based teams for their internal “happy hour”, and involved frat-style accoutrements such as a keg, red Solo cups, and beer pong, all under faux-Greek letters reading “TWΦTTΣR ΓRΛT HΘVSΣ”.  After a female Twitter employee posted a picture of the party on a Facebook group for women in technology, it spread rapidly, with many highlighting it as the latest example of how Silicon Valley culture can, purposefully or not, be exclusionary towards women. A Twitter spokesman apologised for the party, telling Fusion: “This social event organised by one team was in poor taste at best, and not reflective of the culture we are building here at Twitter.

"Iggy Azalea has been forced to pull out of her headline set at Pittsburgh Pride festival, following protests from LGBT groups. The Australian rapper had been under fire for a series of homophobic and racist tweets sent in 2011, before she had reached mainstream attention.  She has since announced that she will no longer be playing as her presence would “further distract from the true purpose of the event.”  The tweets, since deleted, included messages: “Just saw 5 black men get arrested out the front of popeyes. #damn #stereotypes” and “When guys whisper in each others ears I always think its kinda homo”. Azalea defended the tweets at the time of their discovery, saying they were only meant for friends and family. However, she has now taken the opportunity to make a fuller apology for the tweets. In a statement, the rapper said: “I am a firm believer in equality. Unfortunately in the past as a young person, I used words I should not have. The last thing I want is for something so carelessly said to be interpreted as reflective of my character. I meant no harm and deeply regret ever uttering those words.” It’s been a difficult 2015 so far for Azalea, who cancelled her Great Escape tour dates after originally rescheduling them.
