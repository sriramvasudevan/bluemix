"A swathe of central Europe has suffered the most severe drought since 2003 in what EU climate experts see as a harbinger of climate changes to come. Rainless weeks and relentless heat desiccated a vast tract of central European land separating the continent’s drier south from its wetter north between 1 April and 31 July, according to a report by the European drought observatory (EDO). “This is where we expect to see more extreme weather such as floods and droughts in the future, and what we are gradually starting to see in the present,” said Frank Raes, the head of the climate change unit at the EU’s Joint Research Centre which commissioned the report. The drought was consistent with climate models that predicted “an extreme weather battleground” between continental weather systems in central Europe, Raes said. “The big floods and droughts of the last 20 years have been in that area,” he added. Agricultural production has now slumped in large parts of a zone stretching eastwards from central France through south-central Germany into Poland, Hungary and Ukraine, and southwards into northern Italy and Spain. Grain harvests in Germany have fallen 11% and apple harvests 21% on last year’s figures, while a 28% drop in corn output is expected by government officials in France. In Poland, record lows in river water levels have revealed Jewish tombstones and Soviet fighter planes, as well as human remains, buried for decades or more.   Related: Middle East faces water shortages for the next 25 years, study says    At one point, the drought reached what the German environment agency called “catastrophic proportions”, with water levels on the river Elbe falling 9cm below the previous record low. At the same time, freak floods occurred in Demker, north of Magdeburg. “Similarly to the summer of 2003, a large part of the continental EU was affected by a severe drought in June and July 2015, as a consequence of the combination of rain shortages and very high temperatures which resulted in high plant water requirement levels,” the EDO report said. Andreas Friedrich, a spokesman for Deutscher Wetterdienst (Germany’s Met Office) agreed that the drought in Germany had been the worst for 12 years, and warned that is was not over yet. “In northern Bavaria and eastern Germany the situation is critical with an extreme drought and very high incidence of forest wildfires,” he told the Guardian. “Some parts of Germany now have the lowest levels of soil moisture since records began in 1951.” Restrictions to civil and industrial water use have accompanied the water shortages, along with a drastic curtailing of inland water transportation and increases in both forest fires and energy consumption for cooling, according to the EDO report. It found that monthly rainfall averages fell by as much as 80% in parts of France, and parts of northern Spain experienced daily temperatures over 30 degrees for more than 40 consecutive days. Drought conditions did ease in August, but the European centre for medium-range weather forecasting predicts above average temperatures across the continent in September, with drier than usual conditions for most of central and northern Europe. While the UK and some parts of Europe have been relatively unaffected by the water shortages, the drought was even worse than 2003 in regions such Limousin in France, Rhine Hessen-Phalz in Germany and Oost Vlaanderen, Belgium. However, Dim Coumou, a climate modeller at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research advised caution in drawing conclusions about individual weather events. “It is too early to say how severe the current drought in Europe is,” he said. “The Mediterranean is generally considered a hotspot and the models project strong increases in drought conditions there. But where exactly the [central European] belt is, I don’t think can be quantified,” he said.",2015-08-27T15:34:15Z,European ‘extreme weather belt’ linked to worst drought since 2003,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""2eb54ad03278adbb5577c01ee45c53f5e61d7ded""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/2eb54ad03278adbb5577c01ee45c53f5e61d7ded/0_0_3961_2374/1000.jpg"" alt=""An aerial view shows dried out areas of the Rhine river in Cologne, Germany."" width=""1000"" height=""599"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">An aerial view shows dried out areas of the Rhine river in Cologne, Germany.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Henning Kaiser/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>",0,"Severe droughts that stretched across a central European band this summer are consistent with climate models for a warming continent, experts say",http://media.guim.co.uk/2eb54ad03278adbb5577c01ee45c53f5e61d7ded/0_0_3961_2374/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/27/european-extreme-weather-belt-linked-to-worst-drought-since-2003,6,negative
"In a recent interview, Ben &amp; Jerry’s activism manager, Chris Miller, looked at California as the leader in the US’ fight against climate change. As activism manager, you’re tasked with championing causes Ben &amp; Jerry’s believes in, and tackling the problems behind climate change is part of the company’s mission. How would you describe the current landscape? We’re living in a spooky and troubling era where science fiction and post-apocalyptic scenarios rapidly resemble scientific facts. Early warnings of climate warming leading to extreme weather have become reality – historic droughts on four continents, heat waves and record monsoons making reliable weather a distant memory. Yet in the US, Congress has failed to produce a national policy on climate change. America lags behind other countries like Germany, where renewable energy production has tripled in the last decade.   Related: California governor calls for drastic reduction in gas emissions by 2030    Do any bright spots exist? Which regions or states are making headway? California represents the canary in the coalmine for climate change’s impact in the US. California has suffered a fourth year of a record-breaking drought impacting 97% of the state – and yet this extreme weather could become the new normal. Record-breaking low snow in the Sierras creates intensifying stress across industries and communities relying on the water that is typically stored, then released from high elevations to low. Meanwhile, farmers relying on irrigation to grow most of the nation’s produce face water rationing in their region, thereby reducing their output; these conditions force many to leave the state all together. Ongoing rain shortages in California have left trees dead and dry – perfect tinder for wildfires – and create divides between wealthy neighborhoods and poorer ones when communities are asked to reduce water use. Yet you believe California can lead the nation on climate change? Absolutely – even as California becomes progressively parched, the state has passed stronger policies on climate change than any other state. California is pursuing aggressive environmental goals including reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030. One of the ways California will meet this goal is through a market-based cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emissions that sets a broad set of guardrails around the energy sector, allowing companies to find the lowest cost efficiencies and technologies to reduce the state’s carbon footprint.   Related: California calls on pension funds to divest from coal in climate change push    Does the system work? Yes. While cap-and-trade appears complex, the program cap now covers 85% of the state’s emissions and the state has $1.6bn in the bank – paid by carbon polluters. The state applies that money towards a Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund; now $230m goes towards lower income communities suffering from the worst pollution. Most importantly, as of January 2015, emissions from capped entities are down 4%, making the state very confident it can reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 – one of its key goals.  What other positive developments do you pin your hopes on? President Barack Obama’s own plan for a national carbon cap-and-trade program imploded under the weight of partisan politics. So he used his executive authority to regulate emissions reductions via the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The recently adopted Clean Power Plan tasks individual states with cutting emissions and incentivizes investment in renewable energy. Republicans and coal industry lobbyists are rattling their swords in opposition, and lawsuits are expected from coal-dependent states. California isn’t the sort of state to wait and see if a partisan government can reach a compromise. Its strong climate policies show the rest of the US a cost-effective roadmap for reducing emissions while creating jobs and growing the economy. Taking, improving and repeating California’s successes on a national level would bring a positive outcome and avoid this country becoming a backdrop in Hollywood’s latest dystopian action film.

"Climate change is worsening the fires that ravage many parts of America each year. Grime-streaked firefighters battling one of the 167 active wildfires currently scorching portions of the US west will tell you as much. What they have encountered on the firelines in the past few years is evidence that everything has changed as a result of global warming.  In mid-August, the day after a quick-moving fire first exploded southwest of Boise, Idaho, the blaze more than doubled in size to nearly 79,000 acres in one four hour stretch. Along the way, it sparked a “firenado” that rained hot ash and dirt on firefighters.  Or consider the disturbing talk surrounding the still-smoldering fire named Rocky that this month scorched 70,000 acres near Napa, California: “This fire wants to do whatever it wants,” Jason Shanley, a Cal Fire spokesman, observed, adding “It’s defying all odds. 30 year, 40 year veterans have never seen this before.” Last year, a raging wild land fire blasted into Yosemite National Park, propelled by a self-generated micro-climate that intensified its unpredictability. Even the idea that there is a definitive fire season has gone up in smoke. The calendar doesn’t matter when flames scoot across a Colorado snowfield in December, as happened in 2012, or blacken foothills in Southern California’s rainy months. But what firefighters believe is abnormal is just a new normal driven by climate change. Temperatures that spike above long-held norms, record-breaking low-humidity levels, multi-year droughts, tinder-dry vegetation and fierce winds are among the factors fueling these new, more massive infernos. The sooner that firefighting agencies, public officials, policymakers and citizens acknowledge the impact that climate change is having on the frequency, intensity, duration and behavior of fire, the sooner that they will begin to develop new responses to wildland fire in the US west.  Doing so will mean admitting that climate change is also disrupting the capacity of firefighting organizations to respond. They were created to snuff out fires based on what were perceived to be static weather patterns – the old normal.  Today’s powerful conflagrations have also exposed the conceit that we must fight all fires, everywhere. That commitment is made doubly dangerous given how dried out the US west has become due to the mega-drought that has been wracking the region since 2010.   Factoring climate change into our calculations about what fires we’re able and not able to fight will be a hard concession for firefighters and the public to accept. Still, we will have to let some fires burn, particularly those distant from populated areas.  Yet making such tough choices must come coupled with an increase in spending at national, state and local levels for fire-prevention measures. The US Forest Service is now spending more than 50% of its budget on firefighting alone, which is seriously undercutting its ability to conduct more cost-effective thinning of forests that can diminish a fire’s intensity and speed.  More money is also needed for educational outreach to those inhabiting fire zones – dubbed the wildland-urban interface – to ensure that their dwellings are more fire safe and defensible. This investment is particularly imperative in California, where more than two million people live in these zones, putting themselves directly in the path this new fire regime.  The extreme situations wildland firefighters now regularly encounter are warning signs. How bad it gets depends on how quickly we can read and respond to them.",2015-08-24T11:15:08Z,"When firefighters speak out on climate change, we ought to listen up","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""9a456daf3e4fd2e1c793d85c691d2d1a3f9a6bc2""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/21/1440193177948/d550eb2e-4e1b-4e6c-b93f-80ead5cd74d5-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""climate"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Is this the brave new future of climate change?</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",2,Freak wild fires are becoming the new normal as global weather patterns have changed dramatically but we still not have accepted that<br>,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/21/1440193178368/d550eb2e-4e1b-4e6c-b93f-80ead5cd74d5-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/24/firefighters-climate-change-drought,6,negative
"Rain could come to drought-stricken California this fall, as one of the strongest El Niño weather patterns in recorded history looks set to hit the state, the National Weather Service (NWS) said on Thursday. The NWS’s Climate Prediction Center said that current measurements were stronger than those detected ahead of the 1997 El Niño, which doubled rainfall in southern California. El Niño is a complex weather pattern resulting from variations in ocean temperatures, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But Mike Halpert, deputy director of the Climate Prediction Center, warned that even if El Niño did bring increased rain, the effect on the drought would be limited. “One season of above normal rain and snow is very unlikely to erase four years of drought,” Halpert said. The National Weather Service measured increased temperatures in the Pacific ocean in July, which indicate “a significant and strengthening El Niño”. The 1997 El Niño triggered one of the most severe storm systems in the state’s recent history, doubling the average rainfall from December 1997 to February 1998.  To truly benefit the state, rain and snow would need to reach northern California to fill some of the state’s primary reservoirs and increase the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountains.  Kevin Werner, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s western region climate services, said that El Niño tends to bring above normal precipitation to southern California, but is not proven to have such effects on northern California.   Related: On the hunt for 'moral breaches' with California's foremost drought-shamer    “This is important because most of the water resources in the state originate from the much wetter mountain areas in the central and northern part of California along with the upper Colorado river basin,” Werner said. While the weather system typically brings rain, it is also tied to mudslides and flooding.  The National Weather Service said that all of its models predict that the weather system will continue into spring 2016, peaking in late fall or early winter of 2015.

"At first sight, the scrubby land around Lost Hills in California’s Central Valley looks like the worst place in the world to grow anything. The climate is unrelentingly hot, dry and smoggy. The soil frequently leaches toxic white selenium salts. And the area is dotted with oil wells – the tail end of a century-long oil boom that has sucked away precious water resources, brought benzene and other toxins to the surface and each year generates tens of billions of gallons of chemical-laden wastewater, some of which has been found to be stored in unlined pits threatening the integrity of the desperately depleted local groundwater supply. Yet Lost Hills is the centre of an extraordinary almond and pistachio empire – crops now nicknamed “the devil’s nut” in some quarters, because they require more water than seems decent in the midst of an epochal drought. Stands of trees stretch out for miles in every direction along the interstate highway and the California Aqueduct, and right up to the property line separating the holdings of Paramount Farming, the local agribusiness powerhouse, from Chevron, Seneca, Aera and other companies prospecting for what’s left of the region’s heavy, sludgy oil.    Related: Long-suffering California can blame drought on global warming, experts say    More fields are being planted all the time. Stewart Resnick, perhaps the most powerful agricultural entrepreneur in California who owns Paramount, expects US pistachio production alone to reach one billion pounds around the end of the decade – double where it was five years ago. In the 1980s, the Lost Hills area had no nuts at all. Nothing, not even a continuing drought, seems likely to stop him because he has direct access to a vast, supposedly public water resource pumped in from northern California and is lobbying for more via his extensive network of political contacts that include, notably, the state’s senior senator, Dianne Feinstein. It’s a situation that, in many ways, defies the laws of nature. While the rest of the Central Valley is gagging for water, Resnick’s irrigation canals are full, the pumps on his land are humming and his trucks can hardly move the crop fast enough to processing plants and thence to the booming Chinese export market. Conservation and environmentalist groups are incensed – and growing more concerned now that California’s governor, Jerry Brown, has proposed a multibillion-dollar tunnel project to bring more water from the Sacramento river delta down to Resnick’s empire in Kern County and over the Tehachapi mountains to Los Angeles.  They are calling it a boondoggle and an outrage that will feed the insatiable thirst of Paramount’s nut trees, disturb vital ecosystems in the San Joaquin Sacramento delta and, they fear, leave taxpayers footing the bill for the construction costs, estimated at anywhere between $15bn and more than $60bn.     A sign in the Lost Hills. Photograph: Andrew Gumbel    “Like the oil barons of old, now it’s the water barons that rule the San Joaquin Valley,” said Conner Everts, executive director of the Southern California Watershed Alliance, who has campaigned on water issues for 40 years. At a protest this week outside the Los Angeles offices of Paramount’s $4bn parent company, Wonderful – whose holdings also include Fiji Water, Teleflora and the Pom Wonderful range of pomegranate juices and other products – activists dressed up in almond masks and held signs that read: “More Resnick Almonds = less H2O for CA.” “Who are they wonderful for?” protester Ann Shabtay said of the proposed tunnels. “Not for us, not for the taxpayers.” Everts and other campaigning environmentalists hope they can lobby powerful regional politicians including the Los Angeles mayor, Eric Garcetti, to tell Governor Brown they don’t need the extra water because they are working hard to conserve and save locally. Los Angeles cut consumption by more than 15% over the past year, and the state as a whole reduced urban usage by 27%. But the tunnels are popular in Kern County, where farmers and residents are so desperate for water they don’t mind where it comes from or who pays for it.  “Is Growing Food Wasting Water?” read one sign dotted around Lost Hills. Another said: “No water = no jobs.” With the public comment period on the tunnels project now extended to the end of October, a major battle is in the offing.    Related: Vast areas of California are sinking as groundwater is pumped in drought    A coalition of environmental activists recently proposed spending a fraction of the cost of the tunnels – no more than $1bn – to take all the land in the western San Joaquin Valley including Resnick’s land out of agricultural production, for which it is unsuitable in the first place. They estimate that alone would save California about 455,000 acre-feet, or about 150bn US gallons of water a year – not much less than Los Angeles consumes.  “The western valley is one of the most inappropriate places to farm,” said Adam Scow, California director of the group Food and Water Watch. “Not only is it the hottest, driest part, the selenium contamination requires extra water to flush it out. Much of that land should be retired.” However logical that might sound in terms of public management of a dwindling resource, Scow and his partners know they are shooting for the moon. A famous book about water wars in the American west put it perhaps most succinctly: “Water flows uphill towards money.”  Resnick and his wife Lynda do not just have money. They are reaping the benefits of a closed-door deal struck in 1994 that has proved to be the very foundation of their agricultural empire and has endured despite legal challenges. The state’s department of water resources gave them de facto control of the Kern Water Bank, a large groundwater storage facility, fed in part by publicly subsidized northern Californian sources, that was originally intended as a fallback in times of drought and also a powerful political instrument with which to control agribusiness and property development. The Resnicks have not just been able to draw on the Water Bank to build their nut-tree empire. They are also empowered to sell any surplus from the bank to public water agencies for profit.    Related: California drought will persist despite 'significant and strengthening' El Niño    A tiny handful of elected politicians have protested about this over the years, but many more have benefited from the Resnicks’ largesse – nearly $5m in campaign contributions to state and federal office-holders over the last 20 years.  Gray Davis, who ended up being recalled as governor in 2003, in part because he was viewed as being in hock to a number of special interests, was a particularly loyal political contact who appointed Resnick to head his agriculture and water transition team. Senator Feinstein, who faced only token opposition, received just under $10,000 from the Resnicks for her 2012 re-election. The effect on the region’s groundwater supply is difficult to gauge exactly, because California passed its first law regulating groundwater usage only last year and that won’t go into full effect until the 2040s. However, the state already regarded Kern County’s groundwater to be in a state of “critical overdraft” in 1980 and the situation has grown far worse since. The latest data from an ongoing study by Nasa this week showed that California’s Central Valley is sinking by as much as two inches a month because of groundwater pumping that has only grown more frenetic as the drought, now in its fourth year, has persisted. One of the worst affected areas is just 35 miles north of Lost Hills. Everts, the Southern California Watershed Alliance director, said the problem was much bigger than just the Resnicks. He blamed the dysfunctional allocation of water and the enthusiasm for building another vast infrastructure project to pump water from north to south on what he called the “hydrological brotherhood” – a confluence of interests that includes politicians looking for signature projects, engineers, builders and financiers as well as big Central Valley growers. At its simplest, he said, the problem was that California’s water agencies were in the impossible position of being responsible for selling water while at the same time somehow being expected to save it.  “It’s not a surprise they haven’t figured out how to make money out of using less water,” Everts said. “They need incentives, not tunnels.”",2015-08-21T16:01:05Z,Nut empire battles conservationists over water tunnel for California orchards,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""587a44fede2eec35914164d419651aa899d0c4e1""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/587a44fede2eec35914164d419651aa899d0c4e1/0_0_3500_2099/1000.jpg"" alt=""Lost Hills drought"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A drought sign is seen in a field in Lost Hills, California.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Lucy Nicholson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>",4,"State’s governor has proposed a multibillion-dollar tunnel to bring water from the Sacramento river delta to Lost Hills, to aid almond and pistachio production",http://media.guim.co.uk/587a44fede2eec35914164d419651aa899d0c4e1/0_0_3500_2099/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/21/california-water-drought-almond-pistachio-tunnel,4,negative
"Global warming has increased the severity of the ongoing drought in California, as part of a larger trend of human-caused climate change intensifying dry weather spells, scientists said on Thursday. Scientists predict that “enhanced drought” will continue in California throughout this century because global warming has “substantially increased” the likelihood of extreme droughts in the state. Recent studies have looked at climate models to predict the future frequency of droughts while others have analyzed historical records to see the probability of drought. The paper published on Thursday in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, however, looks at how much of the current drought can be blamed on global warming.  Scientists looked at factors that could impact the drought, including temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed and other factors and found that climate change intensified the drought in California between 8% and 27% in the period from 2012 to 2014.  Park Williams, a climate scientist at Columbia University and the lead author of the paper, said he hoped the findings would motivate the state to continue thinking about its response to the drought with a long-term strategy. “California, I believe, has a history of when droughts end, they have a history of discontinuing their efforts to improve resiliency to future drought because those efforts are costly in the short-term,” Williams said.  But this strategy is not sustainable, according to the study. “I hope that the measures that are under way now to improve resilience to droughts don’t end as soon as it gets wet again in a few years,” Williams said.  His comments are particularly prescient as California prepares for rain from the El Niño weather phenomenon – which the National Weather Service said could be one of the strongest to ever hit the state. The storm system is known for bringing heavy rains to California, though it is not expected to have a significant impact on the drought.  A Public Policy Institute of California report released earlier this week cautioned that “it would not be prudent to count on El Niño to end the drought”. The report predicts that if the current drought continues, it will most acutely harm low-income rural communities and California’s forests and wetlands, putting the region’s biodiversity under “extreme threat”. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced on Thursday that July was the hottest month in history since record-keeping began in 1880. This came a month after scientists announced that the first half of 2015 was the hottest recorded.  Jessica Blunden, a Noaa climate scientist, said that heat records like this were “getting to be a monthly thing”.",2015-08-20T19:54:43Z,"Long-suffering California can blame drought on global warming, experts say","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""0597b4ce8147d708a7cb5a1ed1fd6d36e31575c6""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/20/1440099874584/99cdf872-daa3-49b5-b11f-0f07bbf40678-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""The dried up bed of the Guadalupe River in San Jose, California is one of the casualties of global warming.

"India Across large swaths of the Thar desert in western India, traditional techniques for harvesting the little amount of rain that falls has helped people survive the powerful effects of the sun for centuries. The most beautiful of these are step wells – known as baolis in Hindi – large, stone structures built to provide water for drinking and agriculture. Baolis have existed for at least 1,000 years and were constructed in towns and alongside serais (travellers’ inns), across the desert and into Delhi.   Related: Decade of drought: a global tour of seven recent water crises    Baolis exist in all shapes and sizes and are essentially reservoirs built into the earth. Groundwater is pulled up from a circular well at the bottom and rainwater is collected from above. A set of steps – on one or more sides of the structure – lead down to the water level, which fluctuates depending on the amount of rain. More recently, electric pumps have been installed in many baolis to help retrieve the water. “Step wells are etched into people’s collective memory so deeply, they are now part of their DNA, passed on from one generation to another,” says Farhad Contractor of the Sambhaav Trust, an ecological conservation group. Today, many baolis have fallen prey to rapid urbanisation and neglect. In Delhi only around 15 survive but local groups are fighting to protect and preserve them. While 700mm of rain falls on Delhi every year, half of the city has been declared a dark zone – where the groundwater level has depleted so much that the rate of recharge is less than the rate of withdrawal – by the groundwater authority. Rainwater harvesting, therefore, is key to a secure water supply for India’s second-biggest city.     Workers carry out conservation work at Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliyas baoli in New Delhi. Photograph: Anindito Mukherjee/EPA    One such baoli restored by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC) was built in the 14th century in Hazrat Nizamuddin Basti, a medieval village in Delhi named after Sufi saint, Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya. In 2008, parts of the baoli walls collapsed due to sewage water seeping into the structure and the local residents using it as a rubbish dump. The pool was drained and the rubbish, garbage and sludge that had accumulated over the past 700 years was removed to reach the foundation of the baoli some 80 feet below ground level. While the water in the baoli is still not potable, it can be used for cleaning and agriculture. Experts say the baoli model can be replicated anywhere in the world with similar climatic conditions and physiological features. Contractor has been invited to Morocco where he is working on a project to build baolis and smaller wells, known as beris in Hindi. But large baolis need large catchment areas, and in Delhi space is an issue. While the majority of the physical structures of baolis are protected – some by being sited inside historic monuments – urban development in Delhi has had a greater impact on their water levels; storm drains divert rain away from baoli catchment areas. Diwan Singh, an activist with non-profit Natural Heritage First, says that even though many baolis in Delhi are surrounded by buildings, the wells can still be recharged. “Catchment area management is the key. In the small areas of land between the baolis and buildings, rainwater harvesting pits could be built to divert rainwater away from the storm drains,” he says. “Once in the pit, water will percolate through the soil and recharge the nearby baoli, allowing modern development and ancient structures to co-exist side by side.” Nivedita Khandekar Kenya     The construction of a sand dam involves building a concrete barrier or wall across a seasonal river. Photograph: Geoffrey Kamadi    Makueni County – just over 100 miles south of Nairobi – has one of the most inhospitable environments in the country.    Related: Access to clean water and sanitation around the world – mapped    The region’s sandy loam soil supports little else besides the thorny, stunted shrubs that stretch for miles, interspersed only by gigantic baobab trees or some species of the hardy acacia. The only food crops cultivated here are sorghum, cassava and pigeon peas – drought-tolerant crops. With an average annual rainfall of just 600mm, meaningful agriculture is nearly impossible. Water access is a big problem. In Kenya, 63% of the population use an improved source of drinking water and 46% live below the poverty line. Women and girls in sub-Saharan Africa spend up to four hours a day fetching water, according to the One campaign. But things are changing for the better, thanks to an ancient water harvesting technique being used in the dry regions. Sand dams, which were invented by the Romans in 400BC, have become an important source of water for domestic and agricultural needs. Sand dams are constructed by building a concrete barrier or wall across a seasonal river with a firm bedrock. As the river flows, sand in the water is deposited behind the wall. Over time, layers of sand build into a reservoir for water, which remains stored in the sand once the river level drops. Evaporation is virtually impossible below a metre of sand – no matter how intense the sun – and the water is clean and safe for immediate drinking as the sand acts like a filter.     A woman collects water stored beneath the sand. Photograph: Geoffrey Kamadi    The Africa Sand Dam Foundation (ASDF) has been facilitating the construction of the dams alongside Excellent Development (ED), a UK-based NGO that has enabled the construction of 838 sand dams in rural dry lands across eight countries. The work of ED has improved access to clean water for more than 800,000 people, according to Jonny McKay, the NGO’s communications manager. Not only have the sand dams improved water security for local communities. Villagers are also coming together to form self-help groups to construct the dams with assistance from the NGOs, and to initiate agro-based economic schemes. “We are able to practise agribusiness now that we have water available for irrigation,” says Elizabeth Ndungune, the chairwoman of the Star Thange self-help women’s group in Ulilinzi. Using water from the sand dam built on the nearby River Thange, the group can now grow kale, tomatoes, beans and other crops. They sell whatever they harvest and pool the proceeds, which help families pay for school fees. While sand dams are a cheap and simple solution to some complex problems, they can fail if they are not applied in a way that meets the users’ needs. “The biggest challenge is ensuring that the technology is applied to specific local conditions and people’s needs, rather than simply being replicated from one place and situation to another,” says McKay.  But the initiative is gaining momentum and expanding not only to other parts of the country, but to Tanzania, Chad, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and even to India.

Photograph: Ronald Reategui    On the hardscrabble, treeless highland plain that joins Peru with Bolivia, farmers have eked out an existence for thousands of years amid bitter winters and the harsh sun, at 4,000 metres above sea level and higher. As scientists predict climate change will make the Altiplano’s weather even more inclement and unpredictable, today’s farmers are reviving an ancestral system of cultivation and irrigation using what looks like an intricate piece of land sculpture. Resembling an ornate garden maze from above, suqakollos – or waru-warus – are a patterned system of raised cropland and water-filled trenches.   Related: We only have five years to achieve clean water and safe toilets for all    Alipio Canahua, an agronomist working with the Food and Agriculture Organisation  (FAO), says that the ancient agricultural system, which could date back 3,000 years, actually creates its own microclimate. “It captures water when there are droughts and drains away water when there’s too much rain, meaning that it irrigates the crops all year round,” he says. “When it comes to temperature, we’ve measured a rise of three degrees centigrade in the immediate environment around it – this can save a significant percentage of the crops from being killed in frosts.” A suqakollo can also be a small oasis in the scorching daytime sun, which yellows even the coarse highland grass, known as ichu – the main fodder for the alpacas and llamas herded by the local Aymara people. Canahua has been leading the resurgence of this ancient farming system with local communities, restoring old suqakollos and building new ones. Sonia Ticona, a local indigenous Aymara leader who has been working with Canahua, says that in her village, the women work harder than the men to dig the trenches which are filled with water.     Sonia Ticona, a local indigenous Aymara leader, explains that her community are reviving techniques used by their great-great-grandfathers. Photograph: Ronald Reategui    “Our great-great-grandfathers used the suqakollo system then at some point, and we don’t know why, they stopped. Now we are restarting it and bringing it up to date – men and women working together.” Potatoes have been sown this season – next year it will be quinoa – in a carefully planned crop rotation, explains Canahua. While the yields are smaller than cultivating in larger fields, beating the plummeting winter temperatures, which can reach -20C, can prevent devastating crop losses. The suqakollos project is one of several globally important agricultural heritage systems (GIAHS) funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), which is working with the regional governments of Cusco and Puno. Along with Peru’s agricultural ministry, the FAO is promoting family farming with the GIAHS methodology.  Canahua’s only frustration is that it’s not possible to make the suqakollos as big as Puno’s pre-hispanic people did. Archaeologists say that people have lived on the Altiplano – on the shores of the highest navigable lake, Lake Titicaca – for some 8,000 years, and traces of the ancient canals still mark the high plain. Roads and boundaries between communal lands, however, have limited the space available.   Related: What ‘rain’ means to aid workers around the world – in pictures    John Preissing, the FAO’s representative in Peru, says the pilot project has produced more than double the normal crop yields. “We can’t isolate just the fact that we‘re using suqakollos but we can say that between the water management, the soil management and the fertiliser management, we are reaching double the harvest numbers.”  Figures for 2013-14 indicate that suqakollo’s crop yields for quinoa are 3.2 tonnes per hectare, more than double the average of 1.3 tonnes per hectare for the same crop grown on the plain. Ancestral crops like quinoa, and its kiwicha and kaniwa varieties, could make this labour-intensive, complex farming system worthwhile; international demand for the superfoods has multiplied the price, bringing in extra income for these smallholder farmers.

"In the latter part of July there was not a cloud in sight over La Guajira, Colombia. The rainy season should have begun in late April or early May, but during the past months only a few drops of precious rain have fallen on the parched landscape surrounding the departmental capital of Riohacha. As you drive along dusty roads to outlying ‘rancherías’ – isolated rural villages inhabited by the predominant Wayúu indigenous population – there is a visible line about 5 feet up the trunks of the scrub trees and bushes that line the road, where wandering herds of goats have eaten every piece of green within their reach. “It’s El Niño” the villagers say, referring to the periodic effect of the rain-stealing weather pattern. “The bad little boy has come again to make our lives even harder.” This is the second year in a row that a lack of rain has assailed the people of La Guajira. In this northern peninsula of Colombia where the presence of water can mean life or death, the continued scarcity of rainfall is taking its toll. During last year’s prolonged drought, infant malnutrition and mortality from water-related illness rose alarmingly. Approximately 20,000 livestock – crucial to the livelihoods of the Wayúu – perished from lack of water and forage. According to the latest predictions of the Colombian Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies (known as IDEAM for its acronym in Spanish), the current climatic conditions will most likely extend through August – possibly right on through the next rainy season that normally occurs in September and October.     Aguyauda is helping to reduce the impact of the water crisis. Photograph: Femsa    The impact of this year’s El Niño phenomenon can be easily seen: traditional jagüeys – rain catchment ponds that provide water to both the Wayúu villagers and their animals – have dried. Community wells produce less and less water and the water they do provide is becoming increasingly salty – to the point of being unfit for human consumption. Stopgap government and privately – funded programs designed to provide temporary relief by sending tanker trucks of water out to the rural villages are becoming the rule rather than the exception, and are often the only source of water to which a community has access. It is in this environment that the non-profit organisation Aguayuda (Water Help) carries out its work to help alleviate the situation and bring a ray of hope to the villages it serves. A member of an international grouping of sixteen organisations brought together by the Millennium Water Alliance (MWA), Aguayuda is also part of Lazos de Agua, a program which was launched by FEMSA Foundation MWA, and Coca-Cola Latin America with the goal of giving access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene to over 100,000 people, including the Wayúu, in five Latin American countries. Paola Lopez, a bi-lingual social worker helping to coordinate Aguayuda’s efforts in the Wayúu villages – work that includes the repair of windmills, the installation of water storage tanks and important training and organisation in water, sanitation and hygiene – says this about her experience: “When we go into the villages, we see how great the need for water is and how much it affects every aspect of their life.  “Sometimes the most important thing is to just provide immediate relief with a water truck delivery. Then we can look at other solutions, such as training in how to better manage the water resources they have and community organisation so they can begin to take control of and address their own water needs.”     “When we go into the villages, we see how great the need for water is and how much it affects every aspect of their life.” Photograph: Femsa    Addressing the water crisis in La Guajira is not easy or glamorous. It requires long days and hard travel on dusty roads to isolated Wayúu communities. Often the solution isn’t readily seen or available and involves a long process of working alongside the villagers to identify the best way forward. What is most important is to foment a sense of hope and determination as they make their way through the immediate crisis and turn their attention to ensuring that their water and sanitation needs are met well into the future.  “We try to take a long-term approach to addressing the effects of the drought.” states Simón Zimmer, Aguayuda co-founder and program director. “Climate change is an ongoing fact of life here, and while we can do little to stop it, we can help prepare the people of La Guajira to better confront it. In addition to providing the Wayúu community with basic tools and knowledge to ensure their health and wellbeing during this period of crisis, we work with other organisations in the area in order to develop strategies for supporting the Wayúu community in their quest for long-lasting solutions that ensure safe and secure access to water that meets all of their daily needs. It may be a dream, but it’s a dream worth having.” Bill Weaver is executive director of Aguayuda, Colombia.

"A rare and powerful rainstorm has drenched parched southern California, simultaneously wreaking havoc on major roadways and power lines while helping firefighters gain control of a wildfire that broke out on Friday. Heavy rains on Saturday and Sunday closed beaches and knocked out power for many southern California residents. The storm rained out a Los Angeles Angels home game for the first time in two decades. The San Diego Padres home game has also been postponed due to inclement weather.  A bridge along Interstate 10, a major freeway connecting southern California and Arizona, washed out on Sunday amid the deluge in the desert. The collapse injured one driver and left hundreds of other cars stranded. It also cut off traffic in both directions, brining travel to a grinding halt.  Terri Kasinga, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Transportation, told the Associated Press that the interstate is closed “completely and indefinitely” and provided no timeframe for when the corridor would be re-opened. She added that crews would begin assessing the damage on Monday.      A car hangs on the collapsed bridge of the eastbound Interstate 10 freeway west of Desert Center, California.

Meanwhile, the storm helped firefighters contain nearly 60% of a wildfire that destroyed dozens of vehicles and a handful of homes after sweeping across a freeway and barreling into a nearby community. California is in the midst of a four-year drought, and wildfires are not uncommon. Summer rain in southern California, however, is.  The rainfall set a number of records on Saturday.

"California is bracing for thunderstorms and monsoonal moisture in the next few days, but the weather is not expected to alleviate the state’s historic drought. The storms will carry the risk of lightning and flash floods as well as heatwaves with muggy conditions, putting emergency services on alert. A strong ridge of high pressure expanding westward from Mexico, Texas and Arizona is expected to sharply increase temperatures on Wednesday through Friday and draw monsoonal moisture into the region. The rainfall will not ease the four-year-old drought, said Chris Hintz, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service (NWS) office in Sacramento. “Absolutely not. Not even close.” In fact the storms will be accompanied by triple-digit temperatures and may trigger wildfires, he warned. “Initially the thunderstorms will probably not produce a lot of rain. They will mainly be isolated and over the mountains. They could produce more fires because of the lightning.”   Related: Wildfires torch bone-dry northern California as temperatures rise    Jan Null, a former NWS lead forecaster who now runs a consultancy, Golden Gate Weather Services, said monsoonal moisture did not signify torrential, tropical downpour. “It’ll be very spotty. It won’t make a dent in the drought.” The heatwave began in Sacramento on Tuesday, where temperatures were expected to reach 104F (40C). They could exceed 107F later this week.  July, typically an arid month, has turned out to be one of the wettest in California history. Some of the downpours helped douse wildfires but the accompanying lightning also started about half a dozen new ones. Storms last week also caused a mud and rock slide on Highway 140 near the western edge of Yosemite park, and washed away a bridge along Interstate 10, a major freeway connecting southern California and Arizona. Damper vegetation is a mixed blessing for firefighters. It can reduce kindling-type conditions for several days but if heat returns the new, green shoots can quickly die and become fuel for a future fire. The recent downpours also wreaked havoc on power lines and rained out a Los Angeles Angels home game for the first time in two decades. Climatologists said there is an increasing chance El Niño, a weather phenomenon characterized by the warming of Pacific Ocean waters, will bring a wetter than average winter to California. “It’s already in the Pacific, but that doesn’t mean we’ll got a lot of rainfall. But the stronger it gets, the stronger the chance of that happening,” said Null. There are indications this year’s El Niño could be as strong as or stronger than the 1997-98 El Niño. Even then, busting the drought will depend on consistent rain reaching northern California, home to giant reservoirs and snowpack which supply the rest of the state.",2015-07-28T19:26:51Z,California's impending thunderstorms will 'absolutely not' ease drought,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""6409835289908d6e3caf9d838b271242c177b6b7""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/6409835289908d6e3caf9d838b271242c177b6b7/0_146_2992_1795/1000.jpg"" alt=""california rain"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A Venice Beach surfer walks out to the water under a canopy of tropical clouds during southern California’s last bout of rain earlier this month.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Jonathan Alcorn/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>",10,"Experts say rain will be accompanied by a heatwave, drawing in monsoonal moisture to the parched state, but lightning may trigger more wildfires",http://media.guim.co.uk/6409835289908d6e3caf9d838b271242c177b6b7/0_146_2992_1795/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/28/california-thunderstorms-rain-drought-not-ease,6,negative
"Salads have rarely been so expensively dressed after a combination of drought and disease pushed the price of olive oil up 10% so far this year, amid warnings from suppliers that harvests are the worst they have seen. The Italian government has declared a “state of calamity” in the provinces of Lecce and Brindisi on the heel of the country, where olive groves are being attacked by a bacterial disease nicknamed “olive ebola” . Up to 1m centuries-old olive trees could be felled in one of the most picturesque tourist spots of Italy in an attempt to contain the problem.   Related: Price of olive oil soaring after worst harvest in over a decade    The cost of the raw material has been increasing for two years as crops have been hit by drought in Spain, the world’s biggest producer of the oil, and the bacterial disease Xylella fastidiosa, which is destroying trees in Italy. Analysts are expecting prices to remain high in coming months as demand is increasing. Retailers and distributors wanted to buy 12% more olive oil than exporters were able to deliver last month, according to industry insiders. Buyers in Latin America have turned to Europe in the wake of poor harvests over the Atlantic, while eastern Europeans have also been using increasing amounts of olive oil. The next harvest from southern Europe is not expected until September, but fears of a third poor harvest in a row in Spain and Italy continue to push up wholesale prices of remaining stocks over the summer. The other two large olive oil producers, Greece and Tunisia, had good yield and production, but not enough to compensate for Spain and Italy. In the UK, heavy price competition between retailers, led by the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl, has helped keep prices relatively low for shoppers. But this year, retailers and processors have been forced to pass on increases as the cost of the raw material from Italy has hit a 10-year high. The average retail price of a litre of extra virgin olive oil has risen from £6.32 in December to £6.95 this month, according to data from trade journal the Grocer.   Graph showing the average retail price of extra virgin olive oil in the UK   One olive oil supplier told the Guardian: “Retailers and suppliers hold a lot of stock and contracts are signed for six months or a year, so volatility in the market can take a while to feed through to supermarket shelves. Retailers absorbed price rises earlier in the year because they were pegged by discounters but there has been absolutely no letup and we’re now in a crisis situation. “Until this year I would have said this was just the vagaries of the olive oil market. But nobody has seen it this bad. I don’t know that I would go as far as to blame global warming but clearly three years of bad harvest would be almost unknown.” The EU’s health and food safety commissioner, Vytenis Andriukaitis, visiting southern Italy this week amid concern about the disease, which is also a threat to citrus and grape crops, said it was an emergency situation: “Every day matters. Because every day is a day in which we are putting the healthy olive trees of Puglia at risk.” The EU has warned that there would be serious consequences for supply chains if the disease spreads.

Photograph: Max Frigione/AP    Olive harvests work on a cycle in which trees generally produce a strong harvest one year and then weaker results the following year as the trees take a bit of rest. Last year should have been a strong season in Spain, but fierce hot and dry weather meant yields were lower than hoped for. This year again, the country suffered from a dry and fiercely hot spring, when the olives flower, raising fears of another poor crop. Lourdes Negrillo, from Vallejo, a producer from the Jaén province in southern Spain, said: “It didn’t rain as much as it should’ve done in the spring and that doesn’t help with the feeling about this next crop. I think that the new crop won’t be as bad as last year but probably the olives will be smaller and have less quantities of oil. If it rains in September and October then we will get a bit more. It will be a different picture.” Vito Martielli, an analyst at Rabobank, said good weather conditions during the next few months would be crucial for Spain: “In the coming months, prices are expected to be sustained and in particular the premium extranvirgin olive oil which is experiencing even stronger price increase in Italy.” ",2015-07-24T18:42:49Z,Olive oil prices surge due to drought and disease in Spain and Italy,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""6877fa8c373f18742944f864efebacf588c51c60""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/6877fa8c373f18742944f864efebacf588c51c60/0_14_3307_1984/1000.jpg"" alt=""Workers cut down an olive tree infected with the Xylella fastidiosa bacteria"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Workers cut down an olive tree infected with the <em>Xylella fastidiosa </em>bacteria in Oria, near Brindisi, southern Italy. </span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Gaetano Lo Porto/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>",11,"Producers say this year’s harvests are worst they have seen, as consumer demand begins to outstrip supply ",http://media.guim.co.uk/6877fa8c373f18742944f864efebacf588c51c60/0_14_3307_1984/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/24/olive-oil-prices-surge-drought-disease-spain-italy,7,negative
"We hear a lot about what the tech giants are doing with our data, but what are they doing with our water? Water keeps our internet-based economy afloat by ensuring equipment in data centres stays cool enough to funtion. Yet in California, the drought-ravaged epicenter of the technology industry, water is in ever-shorter supply. This raises serious questions about the environmental impact of our burgeoning data demands. The source of the problem  Water use in data centres has “flown under the radar for the longest time” but it’s something companies are starting to get to grips with, says Jack Pouchet, a board member with The Green Grid, a non-profit that promotes resource efficiency in information technology. Water-cooled data centres use an estimated 13.25m litres (3.5m gallons) per MW each year, according to Pouchet. The data centres used by major players can range in scale from 5MW to 30MW. And with an estimated 800 data centres in California, those numbers add up.     Pipes carrying water at a Google data centre in the Dalles, Oregon, US. The blue pipes supply cold water and the red pipes return the warm water back to be cooled. Photograph: Google Handout/EPA    These consumption levels can be traced to the industry’s historical concern with its power use. Data centres tend to use the power usage effectiveness standard (PUE), a metric developed by The Green Grid to gauge the efficiency of computer facilities. PUE, however, does not take water consumption into account. The result has been a shift to energy-efficient but water-intensive cooling methods. “People have driven the efficiency up and the power consumption down,” says Peter Hopton, founder of Iceotope, a data centre cooling start-up based in the UK. “But one of the things that has been introduced to drive that has been evaporating water.” Turning the tide Now that California has imposed mandatory water restrictions to cut the state’s water use by 25%, general awareness of water scarcity is growing, and the possibility of higher water prices looms. Data centre owners and managers have taken notice and started looking for ways to cut water use.    Related: Switching to biofuels could place unsustainable demands on water use    For Vantage Data Centers, which runs three facilities on its campus in Santa Clara, the solution has been smarter buildings. Two of the company’s centres are cooled by a conventional system that channels cold water through the room. The used water is pumped through a cooling tower, over the outside of which more water is run, which then evaporates, drawing heat from the piped-in water. Vantage, however, has minimised the amount of water-cooling required by installing air handling units that can, when conditions are appropriate, pull air in from outside to cool the room. Weather stations that measure temperature, humidity and dewpoint are deployed around the campus; when they agree conditions are right, the system automatically switches to air-cooling mode.  “The building opens up to outside air and sucks it straight into the air handlers,” says Vantage’s chief operating officer Chris Yetman. “That central chilling plant slows way down or even shuts off.” Key to the strategy is convincing customers to let go of preconceived notions about how cool is cool enough for data centres. Traditional standards set the acceptable temperature range at about 18C to 27C. Today, however, technological advances mean wider ranges of both temperature and humidity are safe for most equipment, says Yetman. When tenants agree to work within these broader ranges, less water – and less money – is needed to achieve the perfect climate.    Related: Six things business needs to know about water and sustainability    “We work with customers to explain to them: ‘look, you’re missing out on savings here’,” says Yetman.  The water challenge Digital Realty, which operates 3.5m square feet of data centres throughout California, has responded to the governor’s call for reduced water usage by launching an internal water conservation challenge, says sustainability director Aaron Binkley. As part of this, the company is working with local water utilities to determine where and how it can use recycled rather than potable water in its cooling systems.  “We’re asking, ‘is that quality good enough for us to use, is the supply sufficient for our needs, is it reliable, is it cost effective’,” says Binkley.  Digital Realty’s efforts also include less dramatic yet still essential elements, such as reviews of internal processes to ensure equipment is precisely calibrated, optimally cleaned and serviced in the most efficient fashion.  Energy efficiency and sourcing are also important considerations. In California, power production is second only to agriculture in the amount of water it consumes, so cutting electricity use or buying energy from less water-intensive sources can shrink a data centre’s overall water footprint.  Equinix, one of the largest data centre companies in the US, recently announced plans to install a 1MW biogas-powered fuel cell at one of its Silicon Valley centres, reducing the amount of energy it needs to buy from fossil-fuel burning plants. The purchase is part of Equinix’s long-term plan to use 100% renewable energy.    Related: The madness of drinking bottled water shipped halfway round the world    The greatest hurdles But obstacles remain to data centres tackling water scarcity. Largest among these: money. Water-efficient systems are often more costly than the alternatives, and water prices have not yet risen to such a degree that limiting water use would pay for itself, says Todd Boucher, founder of New Hampshire data centre design company Leading Edge Design Group.  “People are still choosing to go with designs that are more water-intensive because of the cost of construction,” he says. The need for proximity is another challenge. Many companies have opted to locate some of their data centres in climates where facilities can be cooled by the outside air year-round, such as Facebook’s data centre in Luleå, Sweden. But for applications such as high-speed processing, data centres simply need to be close to end-users, wherever they live. Despite these barriers, businesses are finding viable water-saving options, says Will Sarni, practice leader for water strategy at Deloitte Consulting.  “We live in a world where data goes into this mysterious cloud but it actually does have a physical presence,” he says. “And the physical presence absolutely can be part of the solution.”  This article was amended on 22 July 2015 to remove the statement that California will run out of water in a year. It was a statement attributed to Nasa scientist Jay Famiglietti which he claims was misreported.

"He possesses Hollywood’s lushest moustache – a thick, luxuriant growth which seems to enhance the virtue of the characters he plays on screen. The heroic private detective of Magnum PI, the honest police commissioner of Blue Bloods, the doting father of Three Men and a Baby, all bolstered by Tom Selleck’s facial foliage. But now the actor has been cast as a villain of Hollywood – for stealing truckloads of water to try and maintain a verdant ranch amid California’s drought. He allegedly looted water from a public hydrant to irrigate his 60-acre ranch and avocado farm outside Los Angeles. This is a very personal, literal watergate, and it has made Selleck the new face of celebrity drought-shaming, a term of our times for high-profile people who flout state-mandated efforts to curb water consumption.   Related: Moronic irrigation: LA’s new turf war against its sprinkler-happy celebrities    The Calleguas municipal water district, which serves about three-quarters of Ventura County, said it paid a private investigator $21,685.55 to document the water thefts. The district is suing Selleck, 70, and his wife, Jillie Mack-Selleck, in the superior court for costs associated with the investigation plus legal fees, undetermined damages, plus a preliminary and permanent injunction barring the couple and their contractors or employees from taking more water. The complaint said a white commercial water truck filled up from a hydrant by a construction site in Thousand Oaks and took the water to Selleck’s property in the neighbouring Hidden Valley area of Westlake seven times between 20 September and 3 October 2013. Cease-and-desist notices were sent to the actor’s homes in November 2013, including one on Avenue of the Stars. But three weeks later, the same truck returned, filled up, and again delivered water to the ranch.  The same truck allegedly made further trips between the hydrant and Selleck’s ranch four times at the end of March this year. Selleck and Mack have lived for nearly three decades at the ranch. An aerial photo from the real estate site Zillow this week did not show the property as “particularly lush”, with a swath of “fairly dense” trees and shrubbery and “plenty of brown grass”, Courthouse News Service reported. It was unclear when the photo was taken. Zillow assessed the value at $10.2m.  A representative for Selleck did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. But curbing water consumption has become a litmus of good citizenship – and celebrity – in California, which is reeling from four years of drought.  Farms have withered and in some rural areas taps have run dry. Governor Jerry Brown has ordered 25% cuts in urban water use. There are fines of up to $500 a day for residential users who waste water and $10,000 a day for water suppliers.

Selleck has won an Emmy, a Golden Globe and a People’s Choice Award largely by playing virtuous characters.

"  Related: California conservation efforts cut water use by 29%    Some had turned a blind eye to gushy sprinklers. Others had ignored leaking toilets. One blamed an overzealous cleaning lady. Another pointed the finger at thieving neighbours. Whatever the cause, all were officially branded water wasters, villains in California’s drought, and now they were herded together, paying penance at water school. The 19 people gathered at the community centre in Santa Cruz, a parched beachside city south of San Francisco, faced a crash course in rainfall statistics, reservoir levels, pump technology, meter reading, mandatory restrictions and conservation tips. At the end awaited a written test – and then freedom to leave, their fines forgiven. “This is a major, major event,” said Toby Goddard, the city’s water conservation manager, pointing to a colour-coded drought map which showed Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico yellow and orange and much of California an angry blood-red. “We’ve all got to do our part.” The class this week was part of a pioneering effort to curb waste, modelled on traffic school where offending motorists learn about road safety in return for reduced fines. Santa Cruz is especially vulnerable to the drought, now in its fourth year, because it depends entirely on local rainfall. “So it’s up to us. We’re on our own,” said Goddard, who led the class. Monday’s two-hour evening session, the first of the summer, aimed to educate and encourage, not scold. Even so the pupils, mostly middle-aged and elderly home owners, took their seats warily, unsure what to expect, wondering if they were considered the usual suspects.     Santa Cruz is suffering drought and is entirely dependent on local rainfall. Photograph: Stephen McLaren for the Guardian    “I read all this online already,” whispered Andrew, a 49-year-old software engineer, as slides showed the lowering levels of Loch Lomond reservoir in the Santa Cruz mountains. His toilet had broken during a vacation and leaked thousands of gallons, turning a usual $118 monthly bill into $3,600 for June, most of it a penalty. A water wasting accident, not rapacity, said Andrew, but still he declined to supply his surname. “My wife would kill me.” A social media-driven campaign using the hashtag #droughtshaming has cast heavy water users as reckless, selfish splurgers, in some cases splashing their names, addresses and photographs across Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. Some pupils were sheepish, even penitent. “Some of the sprinkler was behind a fence and kept going after I turned it off. I didn’t know,” said one man, eyes downcast. He shook his head. “I didn’t know.” Others felt they were victims, not villains. Barbara Canfield, 72, returned home after a four-month trip to find that monthly consumption in her absence was more than 14,000 gallons (measured as 19 centum cubic feet, or CCF), almost twice a single family’s permitted allotment. “That scared the daylights out of me.” The culprits, she said, were people camping nearby who used spigots beneath her deck. “They used it but I’m the one that has to be here.” Mark Zevanove, 56, a realtor representing some of the 387 residents of Paradise Park Masonic Club, said a collective $20,000 fine last month was unfair since all were being punished for the sins of a few. There are only two meters for all the residents, he complained. “It’s not fair.” Zevanove fretted about a possibly bigger fine next month because you can avoid a fine by attending water school only once. “After that you have to pay.”     Lee Heathorn and Mark Zevanove who took part in the Water conservation class at Santa Cruz, California. Photograph: Stephen McLaren for the Guardian    Goddard proved to be an engaging teacher. He rattled through slides with hydrological arcana such as the Felton Diversion, the Graham Hill water treatment plant and the “ridiculously resilient ridge” out in the Pacific, which had blocked rainfall. “How many of you think El Niño will save us?” he asked. A few tentative hands went up. “We’re nervous and we’re rationing because the drought may continue,” he said. “We don’t know what’s coming around the corner.” It was a sultry evening, Goddard noted. “These temperatures are outside the range of normal. I’m sweating it’s so hot.” The civil servant expressed no opinion about global warming. “I let you form your own opinions about climate change.” But he was evangelical about the need for households to avoid exceeding their allotment of 7,480 gallons per month, about 60 gallons per person per day. Santa Cruz’s limits are some of the strictest in California, which is under order from Governor Jerry Brown to cut urban water use by a quarter. Many cities have shut off fountains, ripped out lawns and banned restaurants serving unsolicited water. Santa Cruz has especially severe penalties that can exceed 10 times the normal cost of water. The crackdown is working. Some 7.5% of water account holders exceeded their allotment during the first month of rationing last summer versus just 3% this year. That will probably mean fewer classes compared with last summer, when they ran weekly.     Neal Christen at Santa Cruz water school: ‘Mulch is huge, guys.’ Photograph: Stephen McLaren for the Guardian    Few pupils at this week’s class took notes. Some gazed into space. But no one fell asleep. “The meter is your friend,” Goddard intoned, urging weekly monitoring. As the class progressed his enthusiasm seemed to rub off. “I was in Albuquerque and it rained every day but no one collected the water,” one woman said in a scandalised tone, deflecting shame on to thriftless New Mexicans. “I see people irrigating with broken valves,” said another indignant voice. Mention of actor Tom Selleck, recently busted for pilfering water, elicited guffaws. By the time Neal Christen, another water official, rhapsodised about flush valves and toilet leak control the class appeared converts to frugality. There were nods when he lauded drought-friendly gardens – “mulch is huge, guys” – tut-tuts when he said a bath can consume 50 gallons and at least one giggle when he suggested sharing showers. The test turned out to be a self-graded multiple-choice quiz. Everyone passed. Then the water school alumni bade each other farewell and went their separate ways, hoping to avoid a reunion.",2015-07-15T12:47:07Z,California city sends its water wasters back to school as drought deepens,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""aada161c8101f39d5ef1362205ceaffdf3f34caf""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/aada161c8101f39d5ef1362205ceaffdf3f34caf/0_87_3000_1801/1000.jpg"" alt=""Neal Christen instructor and class at Santa Cruz Water School in California"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Water wasters attend a class with the instructor Neal Christen at Santa Cruz water school in California.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Stephen McLaren for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>",14,Santa Cruz is offering to waive fines for excessive consumption if the parched city’s sprinkler splurgers and prodigal bathers do penance at water school ,http://media.guim.co.uk/aada161c8101f39d5ef1362205ceaffdf3f34caf/0_87_3000_1801/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/15/california-drought-water-wasters-school-santa-cruz,0,negative
"The drought in North Korea will have only one consequence if it continues: many of the country’s chronically malnourished population will die. Yet their deaths won’t change the way the country is run because the two vectors of power in North Korea – Kim Jong-un’s regime and the government of neighbouring China – have no real public opinion to answer to.   In fact, Beijing has the power to dramatically alter the course of history in the DPRK. Because of this, the west needs to put pressure on both capitals and create a new vector of power: information.    North Koreans need to know they have a very great deal to envy – and to fight for    New platforms and forms of communication are necessary to reverse a campaign of brainwashing that dates back three generations. To counter the propaganda slogan used as the title of Barbara Demick’s book Nothing To Envy, North Koreans need to know that they have a very great deal to envy – and to fight for.  Interviews with defectors reveal that many listen to news from shortwave radios, despite fear of severe punishment, and there is a new $50 portable media device providing a window to the outside world – despite the government’s best efforts to isolate its population. Critics of the state even rely on hot-air balloons to carry anti-regime information across the border, but it’s not enough.     ‘Anti-propaganda broadcasts by balloon is not enough’ Photograph: JUNG YEON-JE/AFP/Getty Images    During the second world war, the BBC broadcast  to Nazi-occupied Europe and, when that war was won, to Soviet-occupied Eastern Europe. Today, the BBC, hard-pressed as it is, must seriously consider broadcasting into North Korea, just as it is doing in Burma. According to BBC internal estimates a Korean service – absent of the regime’s narcoleptic guff – would cost around £1m a year to run and a shortwave transmitter would cost about £300,000 a year.  The outside world are regularly bombarded with information about North Korea – culture, sport and news the nefarious workings of the state – but its citizens need to understand more about the true working of their own country too.  So, if the BBC are able to get it up and running, here’s where I suggest they start: Malnutrition and kidnappings: broadcast that North Korean statistics may not be reliable but tape measures, that show defectors to be between three and eight centimetres shorter than their South Korean couterparts, are.  The World Food Programme attributes this disturbing reality it on mass malnutrition, from one generation to another. Broadcast that.

"When Barnaby Joyce spoke about his agriculture white paper at the National Press Club this week, he outlined his childhood on the family farm. Mum did the books, cooked and cleaned, while the rest of the family chased sheep, drenching, mustering and shearing. Bank loans were for new properties, not new cars. A sheep was killed every Friday to supply the meat, supplemented by a vegetable garden on the creek. The main social outing was Mass on Sunday at Walcha, with the large Joyce family delivered in a Toyota tray back ute and a Ford.  “I hear from some quarters, the day of the family farm is over, possibly walking out the door with the family business and the family house. Like journalism without grammar, the land without the family farm is meaningless, soulless, it goes to the core fabric of our nation.” This was a message meant not for the press club, but for the National party heartland. As deputy leader, Joyce excels at the language that cuts through to his voters in a much more effective way than his leader, Warren Truss. While Joyce’s emotional commitment to farmers is unquestioned, the dilemma at the heart of his new white paper is whether this traditional view of agriculture is appropriate for the challenges of the future. The agricultural competitiveness white paper is often contradictory and perhaps that betrays the push-me-pull-you process behind the scenes over its content, which led to it taking an extra six months to produce. The removal of the carbon tax is heavily trumpeted; likewise the bonfire of red tape. Once you remove the budget measures and previously announced policies, the white paper looks a whole lot thinner.  If you think of FMD as text message slang, this is your guide to the white paper. 1. Dam! The answer to climate change Climate change was not contained in the terms of reference for a white paper that was designed to “outline a clear strategy to improve the competitiveness and profitability of the agriculture sector”. At the time, Joyce did not think it was such a big deal and actually said he would like a bit of the money back that had been invested in climate ‘variability’ by previous governments. The world view has moved on a little since then, so the minister’s answer on Sunday revolved around the white paper’s $500m for water storage. So it would appear dams are the answer to hotter climates and lower rainfall. In the end, the paper did acknowledge climate change was a thing and that “farm management practices need to be adapted to build resilience in light of the challenges presented by such long-term trends.” The government has provided $3.3m in funds for improved seasonal forecasting by the Bureau of Meteorology (Bom). Concessional drought loans have been extended to 10 years.  Farmers have been notoriously ambivalent about wading into the debate on climate change since the carbon wars of recent years. Many farmers preferred terms like climate variability, but it is changing. It is true that farm management comes down to individual farmers. If the season is looking dire, managers may lower the number of stock they hold or decide not to put a crop in at all rather than spending the money on failing. But there are a couple of points to note about the need for open debate around changing climate in a paper about the future of agriculture. If, as some would argue, the climate has always been variable, is the government obliged to offer any drought support other than food on the table? Or, if you accept climate change is a thing, are some areas no longer viable? Even if Australia has given up on carbon pricing, should farmers be preparing to factor it in as the world moves? What role can agriculture play? 2. Farm management deposits: smoothing the rough edges  In a changing climate, Australian farmers have to become even more adaptable. One of the big ticks in the white paper deals with the other big issue for farm business, which is farm equity. Farm management deposits (FMDs) are designed to smooth out profits from year to year. FMDs are held by the banks, a bit like your average term deposit. Up until now, farmers with less than $100,000 in off-farm income have been able to put up to $400,000 into FMDs before tax, to keep for a not-so-rainy day. Currently, there is $3.55bn held in Australian FMDs, which is extraordinary given the three years of drought in northern NSW and nearly all of Queensland.  When things get tough, the farmer can withdraw the FMD and pays tax on it according to the income year in which it is withdrawn. Joyce has doubled the amount farmers can hold in FMDs to $800,000 and will introduce legislation to allow banks to free up FMDs to offset interest on farm loans. It makes sense to allow farmers to use the advantage of equity to offset their working loans but the government can only clear the way. The banks must agree to provide the offset interest. The government is confident the banks will get on board. Over to you, bank manager. 3. Psst! Wanna buy a farm? Young people wanting to get into the industry find it difficult, nay damn near impossible, to buy into a farm while the average farmer gets older. One of the common complaints in the sector is that domestic investors, including cashed up superannuation funds, barely touch agriculture. According to the white paper, 0.3% of MySuper products are invested in agriculture and the government believes this is a result of farmers not presenting “an investable proposition”.  Essentially, what policymakers are trying to do is marry cash with smart farming talent, so farmers may not have to hold all their capital in the land. Likewise, at the other end of the spectrum, older farmers who may want to take capital out of their farm but stay on the place may be able to deal with cashed up investors. While it can’t go into the business of matchmaking, the government believes this can be improved by spending a $13.8m for a two-year pilot programme to provide farmers with knowledge and materials on “cooperatives, collective bargaining and innovative business models”. If it weren’t about farmers, it would sound like socialism.  4. Foreign investment: yeah but, no but, yeah but Foreign investment is probably one of the major contradictory messages of the white paper. Like Matt Lucas’s teenager in Little Britain, the foreign investment section is all: yeah but, no but, yeah but. “The government welcomes foreign investment in agriculture where it is not contrary to Australia’s national interest.” While the document states domestic investors alone can’t solve the lack of investment in farms – and we love foreign investors – it goes on to say they will have new hurdles to jump. The government has reduced the threshold at which the Foreign Investment Review Board (Firb) reviews cumulative purchases, down from $252m to $15m. That is, review kicks in when all farm purchases add up to $15m, so there will be no purchasing the paddock next door if you have hit the limit. It will also introduce a foreign ownership register to see who owns what. Critics have said this policy will scare off money but Joyce said his trip to far north Queensland for Beef Week was like a mosh pit for foreign investors. On Monday he made the point that he needs to account to the peeps. “I have got to be able to sell to the Australian people a sense that we have control of this,” he told the press club. “And we’ve got to show that first and foremost we are backing in the Australian people. We are not their lord and masters, we are their servants and we must listen to what the Australian people say and if they say we must be more diligent in this sector then it is our responsibility to do just that,” said Joyce. I get that. When TV news talks foreign investors, they cut to the Asian face in the auction but the United States and Britain still hold more investments than China. Facts help. But investment thresholds are all over the place. For the US and New Zealand, the threshold for agricultural land is $1bn. Yet the newly trumpeted China and Japan Free Trade Agreements have the $15m threshold. Confusing. 5. Risky business: what’s the collective noun for peril? Multiperil. This is the term that relates to a new form of farm insurance that is designed to try to take the risk out of a risky business. Some farmers have always used insurance for things like flood, hail or fire. Multiperil adds a whole lot more categories and the bottom line is you get a payout if you don’t get a crop. So you get less in a good year but more in a bad year. As climate risks increase, multiperil insurance is slowly creeping into the toolbox and the white paper provides $29.9m for farm insurance advice and risk assessments for products like multiperil. Think of the risk assessment like your car insurance. Your premium is governed by your past history, experiences, yields and rainfall.  Is it a good thing? The risk assessment brings outside eyeballs to what is mostly a family business that has always done things it has always done. This means sometimes hard conversations about the viability of the business and potentially, the viability of the area for the type of farming undertaken. That’s got to be a good thing. BTW, years ago, Tony Windsor did some work on a natural disaster insurance fund. It would be underwritten by government to the tune of $50 a person per year for things like large-scale bushfires, floods, mudslides with appropriate criteria. It was a bit like an NDIS for disasters when normal insurance could not cover large-scale events. It never got legs. 6. The big supermarket watchdog The white paper puts $11.4m into the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to pay for a commissioner to “engage with the agriculture sector”. This is a response to deal with issues of fair trading in the supply chain, notably supermarkets who get farmers in a headlock and keep squeezing once they are fully committed to one large-scale buyer. (I’m looking at you, Woolies and Coles.) But Liberals also argue that this will provide better understanding of markets when there are arguments about takeovers, such as the proposed takeover of GrainCorp by American giant Archer Daniels Midland. Less emotion. More facts.  7. Which leads us to what is not in the white paper Exit packages. While those business assessors are having conversations about viability, what happens if the answer is to give up your day job? There is general consensus in farming that while Australian farmers are some of the most efficient in the world, there is still a proportion who are not viable, or perhaps were viable but are no longer. Whatever. Exit packages have been offered in the past to help farmers transition out of the industry. These are highly contentious in the Liberal party because as Joe Hockey likes to say, no one helps the milk bar owner when he goes broke. Nevertheless, the white paper does not mention the dreaded exit packages, nor even the more polite term of transition.",2015-07-07T03:08:12Z,"Dams, drought, deposits: a guide to Barnaby Joyce's agriculture white paper","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""813e171280dec5031157c05b74ec5d4be88e8bf0""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/813e171280dec5031157c05b74ec5d4be88e8bf0/0_0_2980_1788/1000.jpg"" alt=""‘The land without the family farm is meaningless, soulless, it goes to the core fabric of our nation,’ Joyce said at the national press club this week."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">‘The land without the family farm is meaningless, soulless, it goes to the core fabric of our nation,’ Joyce said at the national press club this week.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",16,"He is a boy from the bush whose message connects with National party heartland, but Joyce’s dilemma is whether his traditional view of agriculture and the family farm are appropriate for the future",http://media.guim.co.uk/813e171280dec5031157c05b74ec5d4be88e8bf0/0_0_2980_1788/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bush-mail/2015/jul/07/dams-drought-deposits-a-guide-to-barnaby-joyces-agriculture-white-paper,1,positive
"On Saturday, some drought-stricken areas in California were faced with celebrating the Fourth of July without the traditional fireworks.  With efforts to reduce water consumption under way and extreme drought drying out nearby land, many areas not only cancelled official firework displays but also sought to crack down on residents seeking to set off their own.   Related: California conservation efforts cut water use by 29%    “There’s two really big family events, and that’s Fourth of July fireworks and Santa Claus,” Rick Kitson, public affairs director of the city of Cupertino, told KPIX 5. “We hate losing fireworks.” Cupertino’s annual $75,000 Fourth of July firework display requires about 100,000 gallons of water to be sprayed on the school sports fields from which it is launched, to prevent damage to the synthetic turf.  “Everyone felt very uncomfortable about that,” Kitson said in an interview with the New York Times. “That seemed to be not quite defensible. Adding insult to injury, [the water] was all perfectly drinkable.” Cupertino was not the only Californian town going without fireworks, and drought was not the only reason. In Cambria, officials were concerned about fire.  “I received the application to do the fireworks show, and it just didn’t make any sense at all,” said Mark Miller, the local fire chief. “There’s no way we could justify having fireworks. This is a cute little town with a big, ugly fire problem right now.” In Fairfield, city officials closed the parks on Independence Day. “It’s starting to dry out and because we are a heavy, gusty, windy area, it tends to dry out the fuels a lot faster than other areas,” said deputy fire chief Jorge Merodio. Concerned officials determined that individual fireworks used by residents could spark a fire.  Bass Lake and Don Pedro Lake also cancelled their fireworks.        In Santa Clara, officials decided to hold property owners accountable for any fireworks discharged on their property. First-time offenders would face a $350 fine; a second offense would cost $700 and a third $1,000. Property owners who were not aware their properties were being used to launch fireworks would get away with a warning.  “As we head into the fourth summer of a severe drought, it is more important than ever that everyone use an abundance of caution to avoid sparking a fire,” said Ken Pimlott, director of California department of forestry and fire protection. “Here in California, we have a zero tolerance for the use and sale of illegal fireworks.” State fire marshal Tonya Hoover said: “Last year alone there were over 300 fires sparked by fireworks ... We want everyone to enjoy their celebrations in a safe and legal manner.”",2015-07-04T22:02:48Z,Independence Day fireworks doused by lack of water in California drought,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""7bf317d64ab4385d8828b497eb090e9645f4033d""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436034177921/fdf12bf1-a925-467f-8d97-e32a8dc15298-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Fireworks pose a fire risk in drought-ridden areas."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Fireworks pose a fire risk in drought-ridden areas.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Seth Wenig/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>",17,"Areas suffering from dryness skip traditional shows as a means of saving water and avoiding fire risk, with Santa Clara setting fines for fireworks used at home",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436034178227/fdf12bf1-a925-467f-8d97-e32a8dc15298-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/04/california-drought-fireworks-cancelled-independence-day,0,negative
"Jennifer and Lawrence Kesteloot like to begin the day with breakfast in their San Francisco backyard garden. For the last several months, they’ve had guests: iridescent green-and-red Anna’s hummingbirds, drawn by wildflowers planted to replace what had been dead brown turf grass and concrete. The Kesteloots hadn’t considered hummingbirds when imagining their garden. Mostly they were concerned about not using much water amidst the deprivations and uncertainties of California’s drought.   Related: Californians urged to rip out their lawns: 'This is about the future we need'     The ecologically rich plantings, the beds of California poppies and wild lilacs, were the idea of a local garden company, which is part of a burgeoning industry that offers landscaping that is both water-efficient and biodiverse. “Most people still look at their backyards as an aesthetic. They don’t think so much about the science of it, the activity and the life,” said Elisa Baier, owner of Small Spot Gardens, which designed and installed Kesteloot’s garden. But as homeowners and property managers replace their water-hungry turf, increasingly many are finding that the moment is ripe to revegetate — paying attention not only to water, but to nature. With drought may come rebirth. Now, says Jennifer, the hummingbirds are a source of daily delight and her backyard is a striking example of the future’s lush possibilities.  To the Kesteloots’ credit, they’d been content to let their turf patch go brown rather than watering it for the sake of appearance. In California – and indeed throughout the drought-stricken south-western United States – few sights are so environmentally inappropriate as bright green turf grass.  Closely cropped bright-green landscapes are a powerful cultural fixation, but attitudes continue to harden against them.     A farm with a lawn and a swimming pool is seen in the Central Valley near Fresno, California. Photograph: Lucy Nicholson/Reuters    Environmentalist Michael Pollan has likened lawns to littering and public urination, and California governor Jerry Brown pledged in April to replace 50 million square feet of lawn with drought-tolerant landscaping. That figure amounted to slightly less than two square miles, or .04% of all California turf, but it signified the future direction. But if lawns are to go, what will replace them? Drought-tolerant plants save water, but they’re not necessarily nature-friendly. Many non-native plants support few insects and animals. They’re green but barren, and some landscapers servicing the growing demand for low-water yards have been criticized for using non-natives with low habitat value.  Worse yet, some simply cover lawns with crushed granite or mulch, replace them with astroturf, even paint dead brown grass green. Which might not have occasioned much lament, had the drought happened a few decades ago – but urban nature is blossoming, with scientists and nature-lovers celebrating the bounty of life possible in cities and suburbs. “Obviously having drought-resistant plants, whether they’re native or not, is good,” said Peter Bowler, an ecologist at the University of California, Irvine and director of the school’s arboretum. “But why stop there? Why not go the extra step and focus on native plants that benefit the whole ecosystem? I think this is a positive opportunity.”  At the arboretum, Bowler worked with the Tree of Life nursery, a native-plant specialist, to plant more than twelve acres of turf with drought-tolerant native coastal species, including cacti and buckwheat and sage. There’s a state-owned wildlife sanctuary near the arboretum. Pacific pond turtles and roadrunners now nest in the sage scrub, said Bowler. So do threatened Pacific gnatcatchers. Songbirds stop to forage on their migrations from South America to the Arctic and back again. “It’s helping sustain intercontinental biodiversity as well as local biodiversity,” said Bowler, and campus-wide native plantings now save 750,000 gallons of water per year.      California landscapers install drip irrigation and a new drought-tolerant landscape in a front yard. Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images    Some California municipalities now offer turf-replacement rebates, but the greatest obstacle to nature-friendly cities is cultural. Urban ecology is popular, but many people are just starting to learn what’s possible in everyday environments. “Lots of my clients go on nature hikes. They love to have a guide say, ‘Look at that bird! And this plant used by Native Americans!’ But they don’t yet think that way about their backyards,” said Baier. “With a little assistance, they could.”  Baier, of Small Spot Gardens, is less rigid than Bower about non-native plants. What matters most, she said, is picking species that insects and animals use. Ultimately the patchworks of gardens and parks will become rich regional habitats in what had been nature-impoverished.  The benefits are not restricted to biodiversity: plenty of studies describe nature’s positive health effects, from psychological well-being to lower rates of autoimmune diseases. But wildlife provides human benefits, too. For Kesteloot, who has a particular interest in insects, her backyard is now home to a menagerie that includes monarch butterflies, Jerusalem crickets, bumble bees and honeybees. Watching the bees is another source of satisfaction, she said — though the hummingbirds, known for acrobatic aerial displays, remain her favorites.  “The boys go way up in the air, then nosedive straight down and make a little chirp noise,” she said. “You know they’re showing off for the ladies. It makes us so happy.”",2015-06-21T12:52:44Z,How California's drought could spur an ecological rebirth,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""5ed27cd2bb18fe6d205669fba14783031795ade8""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/5ed27cd2bb18fe6d205669fba14783031795ade8/0_31_3628_2177/1000.jpg"" alt=""California garden"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The arboretum at the University of California, Irvine.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Steve Zylius/UC Irvine Communications</span> </figcaption> </figure>",18,"As water-hungry turf turns brown in the state’s fourth year of severe drought, many homeowners find the time ripe to revegetate with native plants such as cacti, buckwheat and sage scrub: ‘It’s helping sustain biodiversity’",http://media.guim.co.uk/5ed27cd2bb18fe6d205669fba14783031795ade8/0_31_3628_2177/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/21/california-drought-landscaping-succulents-wildflowers,0,positive
" A surprise five-minute rain shower falls like a taunt over the scorched riverbed of the Ranchería river: fat raindrops spatter in the dust but evaporate almost immediately. Nearby, a young girl and boy scoop out a bowlful of cloudy groundwater from a makeshift well to wash a few scraps of clothes.   Related: Taluorumana, the Colombian village dying of thirst – in pictures    The Ranchería river has run dry after three years of intense drought, decades of overuse and a lifetime of public corruption in the province of La Guajira, one of Colombia’s poorest and most forgotten regions. Crops have long ago shrivelled, babies are dying of malnutrition and livestock are wasting away from thirst.  It was for times like this that the El Cercado dam was built on the river, to mitigate the effects of cyclical droughts in the region, home to the Wayuu Indians. At the entrance to the El Cercado dam, a huge billboard pronounces “From here will flow the water that will be the future to the Guajira.”  The original project foresaw the dam supplying water to the aqueducts of nine municipalities as well as providing irrigation for agriculture. But the massive pipes that should have made this possible lead nowhere. “They never connected it to anything,” said Octavio Calderón of the provincial potable water office.  The reservoir currently stands at 40% of its capacity and local authorities are controlling the flow of the river past the dam to ensure the supply. But the flow hardly makes it past the rice fields, cattle ranches and the world’s largest open-pit coalmine that tap into the river below the dam. By the time it reaches the middle Guajira, where the population is mostly Wayuu, the Ranchería is barely even a trickle.      Esteffany Epieyu, 11, and her nephew Luis Miguel wash clothes in the dry riverbed. Photograph: Stephen Ferry for the Guardian    “There is a lot of demand on the river and very little control over how it’s used,” said Calderón.  Javier Rojas, leader of an indigenous association called Wayuu Shipia, puts it more bluntly: “The Wayuu are dying of thirst and hunger because of the dam,” he said.  According to official figures, 26 children died of malnutrition in La Guajira in 2013, 48 in 2014 and 11 in the first six months of 2015. But Rojas says the actual numbers are far higher. He says he has verified the death of at least 25 children since February, and calculates that at least 400 children have died in the past three years. “I get weekly reports of the death of at least three children,” he said.  The latest such report came from a village known as Hirtú. On 6 June, a two-month-old child, Chepe Uriana, died after receiving treatment for malnutrition at hospital and being sent home with his mother to their village just seven kilometres from the town of Manaure.  “A significant number of boys and girls, mostly Wayuu, have died in La Guajira from perfectly preventable causes,” the country’s human rights ombudsman’s office said in a 2014 report.      Paola Uriana, 17, sits with her daughter Sara Sofía Uriana, 7 months, in the Centre for Nutritional Recuperation. Photograph: Stephen Ferry for the Guardian    Thousands more are barely surviving. In the village of Nuevo Ambiente, a young girl dribbles a cup of water over the head of her brother, who sits in a plastic tub under the shade of a open-walled thatch-roof hut. David is three years old, but has not yet learned to walk or talk. Stunted by severe malnutrition, he weighs just 6.7kg and wears diapers normally worn by a five-month-old infant. It means he’s improving, according to his grandmother, Alcira Epieyú. Until a few months ago, he was wearing diapers for a newborn.  Rosa is another survivor. For the past two weeks, she and her mother Aines have been at the Centre for Nutritional Recovery in the Guajira capital, Riohacha, run by the child welfare agency. She looks like an infant of about six months but Aines says she’s a year and four months old, her growth stunted by a lack of food and clean water in their village in the upper Guajira. Aines says doctors have told her the water they pull from a well is not safe to drink. “But what can we do if there’s no other water?” she asks as she cradles Rosa in her arms.    Colombia map   Wayuu leaders have now taken their case for water to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, requesting precautionary measures aiming to force the local and national government to ensure their access to water.  “We asked for the commission to order the floodgates of the dam to be opened, and that the Wayuu should be given priority in the use of the water. Any surplus can then be used for economic activities,” says lawyer Carolina Sáchica, director of the legal clinic at the Tadeo Lozano University in Bogotá, who petitioned the commission on behalf of the Wayuu.  One of the largest single users of the river water is the Cerrejón coalmine, jointly owned by BHP Billiton plc, Anglo American plc and Xstrata Coal. On average, the mine uses 2,700 cubic metres per day of water, drawing both surface flow from the river and groundwaterfrom wells, said company spokesman Carlos Franco, who added that the mine is using just 16% of the river water it is authorised to use.  “The problem is not our use, the problem is they have not built the pipelines for the aqueducts,” said Franco. “The money for the aqueducts in La Guajira has been stolen over and over again.”      Flamini Gómez Uriana carries water from a well to the the little settlement of Talorumana. Photograph: Stephen Ferry for the Guardian    Alejandro Ordóñez, the inspector general, whose office investigates accusations of corruption and mismanagement by public servants, said on a visit to Guajira last year that the real problem in the department is corruption.  “The main problem of the region is not the drought but corruption because royalties have been stolen for many years and the public works needed to face natural events that are foreseeable were not done,” Ordóñez said.  On 1 June President Juan Manuel Santos travelled to the region to address the water issue. He made no mention of the El Cercado dam and the aqueducts it was supposed to feed, but he promised 100 new wells for the province by 2018.  The Wayuu have heard those promises before.  For now Lilia Uriana relies on dreams to find water. From atop the windswept hill where she and her family live in a collection of mud huts and thatched-roof stalls, she can see two jagueyes – traditional reservoirs dug by Wayuu communities to catch rainwater, when it comes. But the earth of the jagueyes surrounding her village of Taluorumana is cracked dry. It was her mother who dreamed last year of a certain spot where, if she left a necklace for the spirits, they would provide water. A 10-metre-deep well at the site has been serving as the family’s source for water ever since. The water at the bottom is brackish and slightly oily. “But it’s what we have,” said Uriana.

"As water shortages grip California and the seven state Colorado River basin, many users feel no pain, while some face a complete curtailment. That’s because the water management system is not designed to be either efficient or equitable but consistent and predictable. And it is. As is typical in issues that race from obscurity to the front page, much of the blame that has been assigned for this water shortage misses the mark, as people expound on issues they don’t truly understand. Everything from alfalfa exported to Chinese cows, fountains shooting into the Las Vegas sky and explosive population growth throughout the arid southwest has been faulted for the shortage. But it is policies that discourage cooperation and conservation that do much of the damage. One example is the “first come, first served” system – based on the prior appropriation doctrine. The prior appropriation doctrine is the legal system that determines how scarce supplies are allocated among cities, farms, industry, the environment and any other potential water users. In this “first come, first served” system, if your ancestors homesteaded the family farm in 1860, then you are have the legal right, every year in perpetuity, to take your entire accustomed water supply before your neighboring farmer, whose family arrived in 1862, get their first drop. And both users stand in line ahead of the city founded in 1871, the mine that opened in 1898, or the wetland that was not legally recognized at all in this 19th century era of water allocation.  The “beauty” of the system is that you know the risks you face long before crisis hits, something that is essential information to individuals thinking about building new homes or plowing new fields. Arguably, western settlement would never have happened without this incentive system that protects the early arrivals. But you also understand that “water rights” and “water needs” are completely divorced, and when cooperation, sharing and compassion are most in need, you are likely to only get a parade of lawyers protecting the vested rights of their clients. The situation isn’t hopeless. In Southern California, for example, the massive Imperial Irrigation District transfers water to drought-stricken communities in Los Angeles and San Diego. And on the Colorado River, the states today seem much more inclined to bargain than to litigate as some states run short while others are fine. This imbalance is, in large part, the product of an interstate allocation that was based on a flawed 1922 estimate of current and future water needs and supplies. There’s just enough flexibility in the system, and just enough financial incentives, to allow some water to be reallocated through water markets, but such efforts are slow, costly and controversial. And political leaders have been given just enough rope to speak of modest reforms, but only if they can guarantee no reduction to their constituent’s current water supplies.   But in a region facing drought, climate change and population growth simultaneously, the pace of change and the ambition of the proposals are too modest to head off some needless pain and suffering. In the meantime, the winners rejoice in their historically derived positions of power, the losers lament the perceived lack of equity and compassion and the general public demonizes farmers, fountains, immigrants, lawns and everyone from neighboring basins and states that continue to do nothing more than play by the established rules and incentives.  If you think we are “all in this together”, then you know nothing of how the system is designed to work. ",2015-06-16T11:30:05Z,"The Colorado River is not a water buffet.

"A week-old wildfire in southern California picked up steam late on Thursday and early Friday as firefighters in the drought-stricken state struggled to find enough water to contain the blaze. The fire has so far consumed about 40 square miles of the San Bernardino mountains, about 90 miles east of Los Angeles. It is one of several fires spreading along the west coast this week, and one of 2,500 fires to break out this year alone in California. The wildfires have been exacerbated by the historic drought in western states. Almost 70% of California is considered to be in “extreme to exceptional drought”, according to the National Drought Mitigation Center. “Normally at this time of year, we’d be seeing green and wildflowers as far as we can see,” Orange County fire captain Dave Lopez told CBS News. “But because of the drought, we’re seeing brown, dry fuel that has no moisture in it at all.” The drought is also making it harder for authorities to find bodies of water, meaning planes and helicopters are flying farther and farther away to reload. Personal drones being used to film the fire have also gotten in the way of planes filled with retardant. “I think this is going to be the worst fire season we’ve seen yet,” Lopez told CBS. “And next year will probably be worse than that unless this drought breaks.” Residents in the tiny towns of Burns Canyon and Rimrock have been told to evacuate. The fire department says as many as 7,390 structures are threatened by the fire. Wildfires have also been spreading in remote parts of northern California, Oregon, Washington and Alaska. While most of the fires are small, Alaska is grappling with about 300 of them. The state’s snow cover melted off much earlier than usual this year thanks to an exceptionally hot May, giving the fires more opportunity to spread. Those fires are also threatening the state’s permafrost – underground frozen soil – which if burned could release massive doses of carbon into the atmosphere.

"Tony Corcoran patrols the streets of Los Angeles on a bicycle, a lone crusader, his eyes peeled for injustice. He can detect villainy in a stream of water trickling down a gutter, in the hiss of a sprinkler, in the greenness of a lawn. And then he strikes. He whips out his smartphone and records the scene, documenting the offence, and confronts the suspected reprobate with a voice which can boom across a street: “Hey!”   Related: California drought shaming takes on a class-conscious edge    Corcoran is a drought-shamer. His mission: expose water wasters. He uploads videos to YouTube, publishes names and addresses, and badgers authorities to crack down on the aquatic delinquents. “When people look back and ask where did all the water go, I’ll be able to show my videos,” he said. “That’s where it went. Because of too many stupid people.” Some call him a vigilante, but Corcoran, 42, prefers the term activist. He pedals around West Hollywood, Santa Monica, Venice, Beverly Hills and other wealthy LA neighborhoods, watching and listening for excessive water use, impelled by two beliefs: California is running out of water, and Californians are too dumb to grasp the existential threat. “Everything here is about following your bliss and your dream,” he said this week, as he prepared to head out on another patrol. “It’s ‘relax and have a good time’. Tell them about drought and they laugh. They say the rain will come back. El Niño will save us.” Corcoran, a screenwriter and restaurant group administrator, incorporates water patrols into his exercise regime, sometimes biking, other times jogging. “When I shout across the street it can be construed as an angry yell, but I’m just trying to project,” he said. “I try to be nice about it.”     Corcoran films a strip of rocks and succulents. He was happy to see the use of less water-intensive options. Photograph: Noah Smith for the Guardian    He operates alone but is part of a small, vocal community which uses social media to identify and excoriate alleged water wasters under the hashtags #droughtshaming and #droughtshame.  They use VizSafe, a crowdsourcing app that lets people share geotagged photos and videos. Dan Estes, a Santa Monica real estate agent, has created the customised DroughtShameApp. A swath of the western United States is enduring the fourth year of a punishing drought. California is especially badly hit: snowpack all but vanished, rivers, lakes and reservoirs dropping to record lows, farms shrivelling. Governor Jerry Brown has ordered 25% cuts in urban water use, with communities such as Beverly Hills with high per capita use facing cuts up to 36%. There are fines of up to $500 a day for residential users who waste water and $10,000 a day for water suppliers. So far, however, there are few reports of fines being levied. Newly hired city water inspectors appear to be focusing more on education than enforcement – or shaming. “We don’t want to embarrass anyone but we do have inspections,” said Beverly Hills spokeswoman Therese Kosterman. “We find that people are aware of the problem. I think peer pressure can help but I don’t think shaming is ever helpful.” Rick Silva, supervisor of the LA department of water and power’s water conservation response unit, conceded that shaming could be effective but said it was against department policy. His four inspectors use tips from the public to identify water scofflaws but focus on education and warnings rather than fines. Only 39 tickets, almost all for $100, the base fine, have been issued so far this year. State-wide water use fell 13.5% in April compared to April 2013, a significant drop but still far off the target. Enter the shamers.   Related: Moronic irrigation: LA’s new turf war against its sprinkler-happy celebrities    In hope of selling screenplays, Corcoran moved to LA in 2011 from Syracuse, New York, where despite plentiful rain residents conserve water, he said. Even before the drought he was posting on Facebook examples of water profligacy in his adopted city “to show my friends back home how stupid people were”. Corcoran said he was frugal with water and showers in under a minute (beating the late Hugo Chávez, who during a drought in Venezuela said he showered in under three minutes).     Irrigation water on concrete: a major annoyance for Tony Corcoran.  Photograph: Noah Smith for the Guardian    Several months ago, Corcoran started tweeting and posting videos on YouTube, giving locations and times of his discoveries, usually accompanied by indignant commentary warning that 38 million Californians may become refugees, fleeing a parched wasteland. Experts do not share that apocalyptic vision but there is no doubting the New Yorker’s sincerity. “My main motivation is I want water in my tap,” he said. “I don’t want to have to move back home.” The Guardian followed Corcoran as he mounted his 21-speed Raleigh, an old police bicycle, and patrolled a leafy part of Santa Monica.  “I look for moral breaches rather than legal breaches,” he said. “Hopefully we’ll find some rascals out here.” It had rained, for once, so he had to distinguish innocent streams of water from sinful ones.  “When I see concrete getting watered I get riled,” he said. “Puddles in the street – to me that is waste.” He alerts water officials to infractions and credits them with improved responsiveness, but says they could do far more. The water wasters of Los Angeles are not easily intimidated, it seems. Corcoran, an athletic, beefy 6ft 2in, has been scorned, insulted, threatened and sprayed with a hose – manifestations of guilt, he said. “Most people usually know they’re doing wrong.” During this excursion, however, he encountered good news. Many residential lawns were brown or converted into drought-resistant gardens. A long strip of grass outside a school which Corcoran had previously denounced had been uprooted. This was evidence, it seemed, for a recent Public Policy Institute of California poll which ranked drought as people’s top issue of concern. On the corner of Maple and 14th street, Corcoran was investigating a sprinkler in a small patch of grass when a resident, a 32-year-old IT worker named Kevin Behnke, assured him it came on just once a week. He proudly indicated his hydroponic, water-efficient vegetable garden.  “Terrific,” Corcoran beamed. A few blocks away he spotted a young Latino gardener hosing a lush lawn and flowerbed, some of the water splashing on to a patio. Corcoran monitored from the sidewalk, his eyes slits, then relaxed when the gardener ceased watering. There would be no shaming.  “He didn’t use much,” he said. “And he’s just doing his job.” The gardener, it turned out, was Javier Lopez, a 19-year-old environmental science major earning some money for college. He approved of Corcoran’s mission. “I’m very conscious of the drought,” he said.

"  Related: Brazil drought: water rationing alone won't save Sao Paulo    Every inhabited continent, to varying degrees, has areas where there is extremely high water stress. These are areas where more than 80% of the local water supply is withdrawn by businesses, farmers, residents and other consumers every year.  These so-called stressed areas are also the ones most vulnerable to episodic droughts. With chronic overuse of water resources, it only takes a string of years with bad rainfall or poor management decisions to plunge a region into crisis and chaos. Here’s a look at seven extreme droughts that have occurred in the past decade.     Map of water stress around the world Photograph: WRI    Australia’s one-in-a-thousand-year drought Australia’s “millennium” drought began in 1995 and continued country-wide until late 2009. Reservoir levels fell precipitously, as did crop production and industrial water use. A number of cities, including Melbourne, Sydney and Perth, built desalination plants in an effort to partially drought-proof themselves, while other areas pursued grey-water recycling projects. Between 2001 and 2012 the federal government provided $4.5 billion in assistance to drought-affected farmers and small businesses. In 2010 and 2011, following quickly on the heels of the drought, Australia experienced its worst flooding in half a century, as an area of Queensland larger than the size of France and Germany flooded, affecting 200,000 people and costing at least $10 billion in damage. Spain imports water by ship Drought in Spain’s north-eastern region of Catalonia grew so severe in 2008 that Barcelona began importing water by ship from France. About 70% of Spain’s water goes to agriculture, and much of it is wasted through a combination of inefficient irrigation systems and water-thirsty crops unsuitable for the arid climate.  Other critics say low water prices are the culprits as they result in profligate water use and low investment in water-efficient infrastructure. Northern India’s groundwater loss can be seen from space     Water stress in India map Photograph: WRI    Twin satellites from Nasa’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (Grace) are able to detect changes in the Earth’s gravity field brought about by changes in the way water is distributed, including in groundwater storage. Nowhere on Earth are groundwater declines greater than in northern India; Nasa found that large-scale irrigation caused 108 cubic km of groundwater loss in Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Delhi between 2002 and 2008. The study’s lead, Matt Rodell, observed that “the region has become dependent on irrigation to maximise agricultural productivity. If measures are not taken to ensure sustainable groundwater usage, the consequences for the 114 million residents of the region may include a collapse of agricultural output and severe shortages of potable water”. In July 2012, roughly half of India’s population – about 670 million people or 10% of the world’s population – temporarily lost power following a massive grid failure. Some experts laid the blame on the severe drought affecting northern India. Low rainfall restricted the amount of power delivered by hydroelectric dams, and farmers used more power than usual to run water pumps to irrigate their crops.   Related: Farmers versus big business: the politics of irrigation in Tanzania    The dark side of China’s boom Much of northern China is relatively dry – not unlike California and the rest of the western United States – yet it has also traditionally produced significant amounts of wheat and other grains thanks to flood irrigation. Add skyrocketing water use by industry, energy and municipalities to this inefficient system and hydrologists warn that China’s future is in danger of drying up.  Government officials are starting to take action. Water is now one of China’s public policy priorities, and the central government recently launched a “three red lines” policy to improve efficient water use and to place caps on water demand. Yet it remains unclear whether these policies are sufficient to overcome the country’s vast water challenges. Mesopotamian nightmare From 2006 through 2011, Syria suffered its worst drought and crop failure in recorded history. The Grace satellite data revealed “an alarming rate of decrease in total water storage in the Tigris and Euphrates river basins, which [at the time] had the second fastest rate of groundwater storage loss on Earth, after India”. While many other factors – political, social and religious – have contributed to the Syrian military conflict, experts argue that “the decrease in water availability, water mismanagement, agricultural failures, and related economic deterioration contributed to population dislocations and the migration of rural communities to nearby cities. These factors further contributed to urban unemployment, economic dislocations, food insecurity for more than a million people, and subsequent social unrest”. South-eastern Brazil on the brink     In Brazil “water refugees” are fleeing cities such as São Paulo and there is talk of bringing in the military if the drought grows worse. Photograph: WRI    Parts of south-eastern Brazil, including the cities of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte, are struggling through the worst drought in 84 years, with 40 million people and the nation’s economic powerhouse at risk. Reservoirs supplying water to these cities are at dangerously low levels. They’re also highly polluted. Unfortunately, politicians have failed to act decisively to take steps to minimise the impact of the crisis, raising levels of public distrust and frustration. There has even been talk of “water refugees” leaving the cities, and bringing in the military to help out if matters grow worse. Turning now to California California is in the throes of an unprecedented drought, now in its fourth year. Governor Jerry Brown ordered mandatory restrictions on water use by state municipalities early last month, and a group of farmers have since given up a quarter of their water rights this year in exchange for being spared deeper mandatory cuts. The situation is bad, even desperate for some farmers. As I argued in a recent blog, the state needs to improve its water governance in order to protect its economic interests and its citizens. The situation is poised to worsen Forthcoming projections for global water stress in 2020, 2030 and 2040 by WRI’s Aqueduct project indicate that the global water picture is likely going to get worse over the next few decades. Larger populations and growing economies demand more water and in some places climate change will likely reduce available water supply. While our vulnerability to drought grows, the incidence of extreme weather events, including drought, will grow as well, according to most climate change experts.   Related: Getting water where it's needed: will the Lisbon Charter help?    In this knowledge lies power. We know that drought risk is high and growing worldwide. We’re already seeing the impact that water scarcity has on citizens, on the environment and on economies. Sustainable water management plans, clear government monitoring and management policies and wise natural and engineered infrastructure investments could have helped to shore up the dwindling water supply, alleviating impacts on people, planet and economy. It’s time to put this information into action. Businesses, governments and all water managers must quickly and intelligently take measures to reduce vulnerability to droughts.

"The California drought, now in its fourth year, is set to cost the agriculture sector $1.8bn in direct losses this year, researchers at the University of California, Davis found in a study released on Tuesday. The loss represents around 4% of the state’s massive $45bn agriculture economy. When indirect losses are included on top of direct ones to the agriculture industry, the same study found that this year’s ongoing drought is set to cost the California economy a total of $2.7bn.   Related: California farmers resign themselves to drought: 'Nobody's fault but God's'    The UC Davis study, authored by Richard Howitt, Jay Lund, Josue Medellin-Azuara, Duncan MacEwan and Daniel Summer, estimated that around 564,000 acres of previously farmable land would be made fallow this year, resulting in around half of the direct loss in revenue. Droughts affect farming because of the reduction in available surface water. Dwindling bodies of surface water – a term used to refer to waters above the ground, like streams and lakes – lead farmers to turn to groundwater pumping, using water found below the ground. When farmers have no access to groundwater or do not have the means to pump, they may choose to either sell their land or leave it to fallow, Jay Lund, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at UC Davis and one of the study’s authors, explained. Pumping for groundwater alone is set to cost the industry $600m this year. Full- and part-time job losses in the agriculture sector caused by the drought are estimated at 8,650, with total job losses estimated at 18,600 when spillover effects are taken into consideration. But year-to-year jobs are actually set to increase in the state’s agriculture industry overall, despite these estimated losses, the authors said. Losses of jobs described in the study are based on analyses of the California economy over the last few years and expectations for continued growth. The bulk of those jobs lost as a consequence of the drought would have been of the temporary, seasonal kind. The number of jobs lost includes jobs that would have gone to undocumented workers, the authors confirmed in a presentation before the California State Board of Food and Agriculture on Tuesday. In an independent analysis, Paul Wessen, an economist with California’s Employment Development Department, said jobs in the California agriculture industry were down this April compared to the same month the previous year. In the absolute, California’s economy is actually doing well, Paul Wessen, an economist with California’s employment development department, said. California’s non-farm economy does not appear to be affected by the drought, he said. The state entered its fourth year of drought this year. On 1 April, California governor Jerry Brown announced the state’s first ever mandatory water restrictions. The executive order’s aim is to reduce water used statewide in urban areas by 25% compared to 2013. Agriculture, which accounts for around three-quarters of the state’s water usage, was largely exempt. “Water is always going to be controversial in California. Water is a scarce resource here,” Lund at UC Davis said. “But California has a large economy and a large agricultural sector. It’s rich enough that we can keep these ecosystems around and find solutions to manage them,” Lund said.",2015-06-02T22:48:21Z,"California drought will cost agriculture sector $1.8bn this year, study finds","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""70b7864f0b96505f89e0f713411c63f0d38442a4""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/70b7864f0b96505f89e0f713411c63f0d38442a4/0_164_3648_2188/1000.jpg"" alt=""A farmer ploughs his dusty field in Sheldon, California, as a severe drought continues to affect the state."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A farmer ploughs his dusty field in Sheldon, California, as a severe drought continues to affect the state.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",24,"An estimated 564,000 acres of previously farmable land predicted to be fallowed and 8,650 jobs in sector expected to be lost, according to study’s authors",http://media.guim.co.uk/70b7864f0b96505f89e0f713411c63f0d38442a4/0_164_3648_2188/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/02/california-drought-agriculture-sector-cost-study,4,neutral
"It is hard to imagine, but the flash floods and thunderstorms that took more than two dozen lives over the last week in Texas and Oklahoma, and washed away hundreds of homes, could provide good news for drought-stricken California. A developing El Niño weather event in the Pacific Ocean that can be linked to the deadly downpours in Oklahoma and Texas may be getting stronger, meteorologists say. A strong El Niño in the late fall and early winter tends to be associated with wetter winters in California. “There is evidence, if you look back at past El Niño events,” said Tim DiLiberto, a meteorologist with the NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, “that if you have a strong El Niño, it is usually associated with rainfall in California.” California entered its fourth year of drought this year, with Governor Jerry Brown announcing unprecedented state-imposed water reductions. Texas and Oklahoma, meanwhile, saw a five-year drought come to an end this month with the arrival of thunderstorms, tornadoes and disastrous floods.  DiLiberto warned that “seasonal predictions in general are very difficult”, and described the chances of a stronger El Niño and a wet California winter as “uncertain”, if still “above average”. Californians, though, are eager for good news. The Los Angeles Times invited its readers to look east this week, towards the disaster-stricken areas of Texas and Oklahoma, precisely because of what a strong El Niño might mean for them. “What this exemplifies is something that applies to climate variation in the short and long term,” said Anthony Broccoli, a professor in the department of environmental sciences at Rutgers University. “That one particular pattern may produce weather conditions viewed favorably in one place and less favorably somewhere else.” Broccoli called this a seesaw effect that has long occurred in the US, with mild and dry winters on the west coast sometimes meaning cold and stormy winters on the east coast.  But as the effects of global warming kick in, Broccoli said, evidence shows that already dry areas of the world – like California – will become drier. The warming of the planet was also expected to make rain events heavier, he said, with locations getting greater fractions of their total ratio of rainfall during those heavy precipitations, meaning light or moderate rain events would become rarer. As such events become more usual, the solution to ending extreme weather patterns may not lie in opposite extremes. “The ideal to end a drought are rains that cumulatively amount to a lot and are not quite as intense,” Broccoli said. Heavy and intense rainfall is precisely the kind of phenomenon that caused flash floods in Oklahoma and Texas. Last week, the Weather Channel reported that a river in Blanco, Texas had risen as fast as 17ft in half an hour between Friday and Saturday, with water crushing and stripping the insides of nearby homes. A possible rainier winter in California may carry its own extreme weather events like landslides, Broccoli said. DiLiberto cautioned against perceiving El Niño as the answer to California’s drought problem.  “Any rain will help, but we are starting from a very low point. It will take a pretty substantial amount of rain to remove multiple drought years in just one year,” he said, adding that the volume of rain needed to end the drought would likely have knock-on landslide effects.  Besides, El Niño-enhanced rain would still not help resolve the depleted snowpack in northern California, DiLiberto said. “El Niños don’t mean bad things all the time, but sometimes it’s too much of a good thing,” he said.",2015-05-30T12:00:10Z,Deadly Texas floods could herald wet winter in parched California,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""b6f90b024a93a58c67cf0dacf231e82ffc6ec246""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/b6f90b024a93a58c67cf0dacf231e82ffc6ec246/0_0_4896_2938/1000.jpg"" alt=""texas floods"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Floodwaters submerged Texas highways and threatened more homes Friday after another round of heavy rain added to the damage inflicted by storms.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Brandon Wade/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>",25,"A brewing El Niño brought deadly downpours to Texas and Oklahoma, but could be just what California needs to temper its drought crisis ",http://media.guim.co.uk/b6f90b024a93a58c67cf0dacf231e82ffc6ec246/0_0_4896_2938/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/30/california-texas-oklahoma-floods-drought-el-nino,6,negative
"California’s four-year drought is the worst in the state’s history and wide-ranging restrictions on water use came into effect at the start of June. In the longer run Californians will need to find new ways of managing their water supply. Rainwater can be captured with dams to create reservoirs, but there is an alternative approach, that of groundwater banking. River water is diverted into shallow pools, known as recharge ponds, where it soaks through the ground and replenishes aquifers. Recharge ponds have proved successful in the San Joaquin valley, with banked water being extracted from the aquifers, below ground level, via wells. San Joaquin county is extending the scheme, to catch rain water directly by surrounding flat areas of farmland with an earth wall or berm about 60cm (2ft) high. Winter storms are an important source of water, and such walls stop the water from escaping and turn the field into a recharge pond. Known as the Dream project (demonstration, recharge, extraction and aquifer management) the scheme is starting with a series of two-acre trial plots. These require the right sort of porous soil, but the project need not interfere with other activities, such as growing grapes. Aquifers do not lose water through evaporation like reservoirs, and the technique is far cheaper than desalination. Climatologists suggest that Californian rainfall is increasingly likely to arrive in short intense bursts. The existing infrastructure may not be ideal for handling these, but a system of recharge ponds should work like a dream.",2015-06-10T20:30:03Z,Weatherwatch: California Dreaming,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""08fa47d3cb05b7c8ea5c302ed0a24c4f0dfdb01c""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Content_Distribution/General_images/2015/6/10/1433954849562/Reservoir-next-to-the-San-005.jpg"" alt=""Reservoir next to the San Joaquin river, California"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Exposed banks in reservoirs - such as at Millerton Lake, near the San Joaquin river, California – point to the long droughts occurring in the state.

"Would you rather give up your lawn or your shower habit? Can you deal with spray-painting your parched garden green? Can you see the beauty in a front yard filled with cacti and rocks? Low-flushing lavatories and recycled wastewater may not be subject matters you would usually associate with a generally more glamorous and decisively sexier California, but as the reality of drought hits urban areas, these are the questions millions of Californians are having to ask. On 1 April, following the announcement of a fourth year of drought, Governor Jerry Brown issued an executive order demanding a 25% reduction of water usage in urban areas statewide beginning 1 June. That meant that from Monday, around 90% of Californians were faced with reducing their water consumption by a quarter compared to 2013 levels. In high-consumption areas, water companies have been given targets as high as 36%. Customers have been told they must reconsider their entire way of life. But how to achieve such a feat? Rules have been devised by local water boards, ranging from carrots (discounts on high-efficiency lavatories and washing machines) to sticks (fines for watering your lawn more than twice a week, or for watering the pavement). Residents have taken to drought-shaming one another, reporting water wasters to the authorities or on social media. In places like Sacramento, such finger-pointing has been encouraged – to great effect.  But above all else, there is pressure to take things one step further and turn to lawns. More precisely, to the ripping out of them. In his executive order, Brown called for the replacement of 50m sq ft of lawns with “drought-tolerant landscapes”, a goal to be achieved with the help of local subsidies and partial funding from the state’s water department.  “Over 50% of household water usage is outdoors,” said Stephanie Pincetl, a professor and director of the California Center for Sustainable Communities at University of California, Los Angeles. California’s love for lawns is wholly unsuited to the state’s dry climate, Pincetl said, describing the attachment as an “inherited historic aesthetic” that comes straight out of the British Empire.  “Turf serves no functional purpose other than it looks good,” said Bob Muir of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWDSC), which provides water to nearly 19 million Californians. The MWDSC recently voted to increase its conservation programme to a whopping $450m over two years, with money taking the form of rebates on turf removal operations and incentives on efficient faucets. Californians are taking the leap by the tens of thousands. Almost one year into that two-year period, Muir said, half of the money already spent (around $44m out of $88m) has been allocated to residents and businesses undertaking turf removal. Turf Terminators, a Los Angeles-based company created last July, has ripped up 5,000 lawns in less than a year, according to its head of business development, Andrew Farrell. The company started with three employees. It now has 565 full-timers. “People in Los Angeles were excited about a turn-key solution that helped them save water and money,” Farrell said.  But even with help from a turf-terminating team from design to completion, ripping up your lawn is expensive. In Los Angeles, if you combine two separate subsidies from the city ($1.75 per sq ft), and the MWDSC ($2 per sq ft), you will most likely still have to put in some cash of your own.  According to Farrell, the average turf-removal job costs between $5 and $8 per sq ft. This means someone on a budget with a modest front yard of 400 sq ft would still have to pay $500 out of their own pocket for a $2,000 operation, if they went for one of the cheaper options.  If they wanted to go for something slightly more elaborate, the same resident would have to put in $1,700 of their own money for a $3,200 operation. ‘It’s the right thing to do’ For Brook Sarson, a rainwater and greywater consultant, educator and installer in San Diego, when it comes to making your home more water efficient, money should not be the sole focus.  “It’s the right thing to do. People should do it to have a good conscience, to be a good example to their neighbors,” she said.  Sarson first started looking into water efficiency in 2008, when California was experiencing its last drought. She said she was shocked to find very few resources available to cater to her water harvesting wishes and decided to become the person she was looking for by founding her own company, H2OME.  Sarson advises clients on everything from re-plumbing fixtures and replacing lawns to installing rain and greywater tanks – respectively harvesting water falling from the sky and water coming from washing machines and sinks.  A rainwater tank can cost as little as $1,000, up to $5,000 for a tank that will store large quantities of water and make a difference in terms of household water consumption.  Business has also picked up for Sarson. If people turned their noses up at the concept of greywater a few years ago, things have considerably changed. Sarson says clients are more educated than ever and demand is so high she has to limit the number of installations she does a week. “People used to say to me, ‘I am not ready to give up my lawn right now,’” she said. Now, though, people point to those who still have lawns in disdain. At UCLA, Pincetl said: “Part of the challenge today in California is how you begin to change people’s perception of what is a beautiful, well-maintained yard. There is a prevailing sense and desire to have a green lawn.” Some residents in and around Los Angeles have complained that the end results of Turf Terminator operations are ugly. But Sarson said people could turn to books and information available online to learn how to do much of the water-saving operations themselves. And if they did want to pay attention to beauty, she estimated that redesigning a green-grassed garden into a (nice-looking) drought-friendly landscape would cost an average of $2,500 to design and $30,000 to install. ‘There is a greater sense of urgency’ Still, whether for reasons economic, aesthetic or other, California looks to have some way to go to meet its 25% reduction target. The most recently available data showed that Californians reduced water consumption by 13.5% in April, compared with the same month two years ago. The reduction was worryingly behind target for June, but it still represented a great leap from previous months. In February, according to the State Water Resources Board, Californians cut water use by 2.6% compared with the same month in 2013. In March the figure was 3.9%  “There is a greater sense of urgency,” said Heather Cooley, director of the water program at the Pacific Institute.  “Mandatory restrictions is a new approach,” she added, explaining that last year’s voluntary call for reductions had not been effective enough. Cooley said the educational aspect of usage was crucial, with people needing to relearn their approach to water and see it as something precious and scarce.  “The challenges we are seeing now are challenges we are going to see in the future because of climate change and the growth in our population and economy. This is about the future we need,” she said.  In practical terms, what that looks like is simple, said Pincetl at UCLA: “Water is a zero sum game. Either you use it inside or you use it outside. You cannot do both.” So once more: the lawn or the shower habit?",2015-06-04T20:06:57Z,Californians urged to rip out their lawns: 'This is about the future we need',"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""909e8b6d2ee2da58c9c3b128e751e99294e19319""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/909e8b6d2ee2da58c9c3b128e751e99294e19319/0_410_4356_2617/1000.jpg"" alt=""California lawn succulent"" width=""1000"" height=""601"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Can succulents be California’s savior?</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",27,"The American attachment to a perfectly manicured plot of green grass is a dream that is slowly killing the drought-stricken state, so many municipalities have begun to subsidize the conversion of lawns to more drought-tolerant landscapes",http://media.guim.co.uk/909e8b6d2ee2da58c9c3b128e751e99294e19319/0_410_4356_2617/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/04/california-lawns-drought-tolerant-succulents,0,positive
"The last time Nguyen Van Viet saw water in his well was almost four months ago. The 44-year-old has farmed coffee in central Vietnam for two decades and says that’s never happened before. “This is the worst drought I’ve seen in over a decade,” Viet, told the Guardian. “Some people don’t have enough water to drink.” For Viet and millions of other coffee farmers, this season has been disastrous. A prolonged drought has affected all five provinces in Vietnam’s Central Highlands – a region that produces 60% of the country’s coffee. “Normally, in March or April, it should start rain, but this year it hasn’t rained until now,” Viet said. “Over the years I’ve realised it’s getting harder to grow coffee mostly because lack of water. The temperatures are getting higher and higher and the rainfall is less.”  Viet says he’s lost almost 4,000 sq meters of coffee crops on his five-acre farm in Dak Lak, a province responsible for 30% of total coffee harvests last year. At least 7,000 acres of coffee plants have died there since March, according to the provincial Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. And in neighbouring Lam Dong Province, the drought has stressed another 150,000 acres of coffee.  The result has been a five-year low in coffee exports, 40% down on the same period in 2014. The economic costs have yet to be tallied.  Vietnam is the world’s largest producer of Robusta, a tougher, more bitter bean often used in instant coffee and espresso. The French introduced the plant in the 19th century and in the post-war years it helped pull millions of Vietnamese from poverty. The industry grew rapidly in the 1990s, making Vietnam the world’s second-largest exporter of coffee and supplying around a quarter of the UK’s coffee.  But success came at a cost. Deforestation, monocropping and intensive pesticide use that helped create the boom now leaves coffee farms more vulnerable to climate change.  “Coffee cultivation in Vietnam goes hand-in-hand with deforestation, land degradation and depletion of water resources,” says a 2012 report from the Initiative for Climate and Coffee. “The resilience of coffee monoculture production systems to soil erosion, increasing evapotranspiration, drought periods or devastating extreme weather events is very low.” Since 1960, the average annual temperature in Vietnam has increased by 0.4C . And the average number of hot days has also increased.  Climate change projections suggest an average temperature rise of 2.3C by 2100, according to the United Nations. The number of hot days in the Central Highlands is expected to increase to 134 in 2050 and 230 in 2100. Even though Robusta is more tolerant of higher temperatures than Arabica, temperature rise could damage plant development.  “If the temperature really goes beyond the flowering threshold, we get flowering abortion and we’re going to have a serious problem,” said Dave D’Haeze, an environmental consultant with the Hanns R Neumann Foundation.     Local residents pass a dried channel at Thanh Phu District of Ben Tre province in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam. The region is the most vulnerable location in Vietnam to impacts of climate change. Photograph: VNA/Corbis    But the main problem in Vietnam now is water. Rainfall in Dak Lak Province is 86% less compared to this time last year. In Lam Dong, reservoirs are one meter lower than last year, according to the provincial Bureau of Water Resource Management.  Expansion of coffee farms in recent years has added stress to an already limited water supply. “The biggest factor for vulnerability is dependency on water for irrigation,” Kerstin Linne a consultant who has studied Vietnam’s coffee supply chain. “Farmers are using up groundwater and levels are already declining. With increasing temperatures, therefore increasing evapotranspiration and changes in rainfalls pressure on water levels will increase. However, so far many farmers over-irrigate as water is free and they do not know how much water they use.”  Although climate change projections for Vietnam suggest more rain in the wet season, there may be 20% less rainfall in the drier months, according to the UN. D’Haeze is working with coffee farmers on an experiment to determine the right amount of water to use. Government guidelines suggest 400 to 500 litres of water per plant, per watering, but D’Haeze thinks it could be much less, around 350 litres.  “At the moment we know we are using far too much water,” D’Haeze said. “So if everybody is using the right amount of water at the right time, we might be able to have enough during the dry season.”",2015-05-22T09:04:42Z,Climate change blamed for severe drought hitting Vietnam's coffee crops,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""62b5e39588222ca27295209faf34eeb5e6c24cb9""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432035315090/5dd31170-cbb3-4796-bef1-6982eb53898c-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""A Vietnamese farmer walks past a drought-hit coffee plantation in Cu M'gar district, in Vietnam's central highland Daklak province March 9, 2005."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A Vietnamese farmer walks past a drought-hit coffee plantation in Cu M’gar district, in Vietnam’s central highland Dak Lak province.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Kham/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>",28,"Exports drop 40% as world’s second-biggest coffee exporter suffers rising temperatures and drought, combined with effects of deforestation, land degradation and depleted water resources caused by decades of growth",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432035315398/5dd31170-cbb3-4796-bef1-6982eb53898c-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/22/climate-change-blamed-for-severe-drought-hitting-vietnams-coffee-crops,3,negative
"Hundreds of protesters gathered in front of two Nestle bottling plants in California on Wednesday to deliver petitions demanding the company stop bottling operations in the drought-stricken state.  The petitions – carrying more than 500,000 signatures – were accepted by Nestle staff members at both the Sacramento and Los Angeles bottling plants, protesters said, as residents and activists chanted slogans like “Our water is not for sale” and “Water is a human right, don’t let Nestle win this fight.”  In Sacramento, where around 50 protesters gathered, one eight-foot-long banner read: “Nestle, 515,000 people say leave California’s precious water in the ground,” referring to the total number signatures collected on the delivered petitions. California has now entered its fourth consecutive year of drought, and residents of the state’s cities have been told to cut their consumption by as much as 36%. “It is very disturbing and actually quite offensive that a foreign company is taking our water, bottling it and selling it back to us,” said Nick Rodnam, one protester at the Los Angeles plant, who launched one of the petitions on Change.org. While Starbucks recently pulled its water bottling operations from the state on ethical grounds, Nestle and other companies like Walmart continue to source water for bottling in California, buying at the same rate as residents and selling at one hundred times the profit. Morgan Goodwin, a 30-year-old city council member in Truckee, California, who took part in the protests at the Sacramento plant, said Nestle was treating California water as a “free-for-all”, while his constituents had been ordered to cut their water consumption by 28% in a state-issued mandate.  At the beginning of last month, California governor Jerry Brown took a historic step by issuing an executive order outlining mandatory water conservation measures, including a 25% average cut in urban areas. Last week, Nestle CEO Tim Brown declared he had no intentions of pulling his water sourcing operations out of the state. If anything, he said in a radio interview, he would like to increase operations. “There are over 1 million Californians who are without safe access to clean water in California today,” said Walker Foley of Food &amp; Water Watch, a Washington-based NGO.    Related: American drought: California’s crisis    In some small, poor California communities facing clean-water crises, residents spend up to 10% of their income on bottled water, the organization says. “It is a glaring contradiction that water is a human right, but companies like Nestle are allowed to bottle and privatize a public asset at a tremendous markup,” Foley said. “We feel good about what we’re doing delivering healthy hydration to people throughout the state of California,” Nestle’s Tim Brown said last week. “As the second-largest bottler in the state, we’re filling a role many others are filling. It’s driven by consumer demand, it’s driven by an on-the-go society that needs to hydrate,” he said.",2015-05-20T21:23:07Z,Nestle bottled water operations spark protests amid California drought,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""a575f379294a7a4991b86661bb16ae13b9422042""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/a575f379294a7a4991b86661bb16ae13b9422042/0_213_4094_2457/1000.jpg"" alt=""California Nestle protest"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Protesters demand the end of commercial water bottling during the state’s drought at the Nestle Waters North America facility in Los Angeles on Wednesday.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Eugene Garcia/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>",29,"Petition carrying 500,000 signatures delivered to Sacramento and Los Angeles water bottling facilities as state suffers through fourth straight year of drought",http://media.guim.co.uk/a575f379294a7a4991b86661bb16ae13b9422042/0_213_4094_2457/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/20/nestle-water-bottling-california-drought,0,negative
"  Related: California drought shaming takes on a class-conscious edge    With more than two-thirds of Washington state experiencing abnormal dry conditions and more than half of the state experiencing moderate drought, Governor Jay Inslee on Friday declared a statewide drought emergency.  “We are really starting to feel the pain from this snowpack drought,” Inslee said. “Impacts are already severe in several areas of the state. Difficult decisions are being made about what crops get priority water and how best to save fish.” According to the Washington state department of agriculture, about $1.2bn of crops could be lost as a result of the drought this year.  “The drought is unlike any we’ve ever experienced,” said Maia Bellon, director of the state department of ecology. “Rain amounts have been normal but snow has been scarce. And we’re watching what little snow we have quickly disappear.”  Bellon’s department has requested $9.5m in drought relief funds from the state legislature.     The 21st-century projections make the [previous] mega-droughts seem like quaint walks through the garden of Eden  Climate scientist Jason Smerdon     At the beginning of the month, the Natural Resources Conservation Service found that of 98 snow sites measured in Washington, 66 were snow-free, 11 for the first time ever. According to Inslee’s office, snowpack in Washington’s mountains has dropped to just 16% of normal levels.  In California, snow on the mountains has fallen to 12% of average levels, from 28% last year. Snowmelt normally keeps the rivers running – in April, the US Geological Survey found that 78% of streams in Washington state were running below normal. As a result, the state’s department of natural resources expects more early-season and higher-elevation wildfires.   “We have some tough, challenging months ahead of us,” Inslee said. “We’re ready to bring support and relief to the hardest hit areas of the state. We’re going to do everything we can to get through this.”  About 2.47 million people living in Washington are affected by the drought, according to the information released on Tuesday by the US Drought Monitor. A year ago, 55.74% of the state was abnormally dry and 34.66% of the state experienced moderate drought. This year, 67.51% of the state is abnormally dry and 51.82% is experiencing moderate drought.    Related: US faces worst droughts in 1,000 years, predict scientists    The droughts in California and Washington are only the beginning, according to a study written by the scientists at the Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. They predict that the US south-west and the Great Plains will face decade-long droughts far worse than any experienced over the last 1,000 years, because of climate change. “The 21st-century projections make the [previous] mega-droughts seem like quaint walks through the garden of Eden,” said climate scientist Jason Smerdon, a co-author of the study. “We haven’t seen this kind of prolonged drought even certainly in modern US history. What this study has shown is the likelihood that multi-decadal events comprising year after year after year of extreme dry events could be something in our future.”",2015-05-16T21:28:59Z,Washington state declares drought emergency with $1.2bn in crops at risk,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""ec98859e29ae4c3742b586f663ef7fe0827b4462""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431810902294/2f2a323d-18bd-470c-ba7c-765280937901-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Mount St Helens"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Hikers climb Mount St Helens in Washington state.

"This week Penny Button will do something no one in her family, in more than a century on the land, has even had to contemplate: she will sell every last cow in her possession.  Button’s Crossmoor property lies on the Thomson river just outside of Longreach, the outback Queensland town hardest hit by the state’s most widespread drought on record.  Crossmoor may be just the latest in a long line of family-run cattle operations in this district to be forced to fully “destock”. It’s wise to preserve country and sell stock while they’re still in good shape. But that makes it no easier for Button. Selling up is made all the harder by the fact it means the end of the continuous bloodline of Santa Gertrudis bulls and calves imported years ago by her father-in-law, Viv Button. “That’s 60 years of genetics gone – that will take years to get back,” Button tells Guardian Australia from the deck of her homestead.  The majestic tin-and-timber house, more than a century old and grandly proportioned, is set in an oasis of trees. Beyond the green, the desiccated country all around can just be glimpsed. It is not the end of the line for Button as a farmer. But it is the beginning of the kind of extraordinary hiatus that drought inflicts on farming families in this region. Here families are forced to make do with virtually no income when the drought hits hard. This is the kind of hunkering down that can either prove a farmer’s resilience to herself, or sadly push those whom Button describes as the “gentler souls” to breaking point. “My attitude is that the captain goes down with the sinking ship and you never give up,” she says. “You’re dealt a hand and at the end of the day it’s up to you. I would hate to see generations of hard work just lost.”  In these times you live on borrowed money. You keep the banks at bay by paying the interest on your loan. You live like a miser. And you wait for rain, if not this summer or the next. You wait for the grass to grow again, so you can buy back the bones of a new herd. Then you hope that in two years’ time you will have something to take to market and income will be a part of your life again. So this is not unprecedented, a farmer selling her stock. But this drought is now unprecedented in scale – affecting a record 80%-plus of the state, or nearly 1.5m sq km – and its impact on one of Australia’s rural heartlands is building. While the “millennium drought” ran for the better part of eight years up to 2009, no individual region suffered more than two failed summers in a row. Now the spectre of a fourth dry summer is looming in places such as Longreach and the paralysing effect on the state’s $1.2bn-a-year livestock trade is provoking deep concern. Can the outback communities that survive largely on beef and wool money survive this?     A sheep skull lies at the edge of a dry dam on the property Rio Station in Longreach.  Photograph: Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images    The sale of Button’s remaining herd this week could be the family’s last source of cash flow from cattle for a year or more. Crossmoor lies off a dirt road about 70km north of Longreach, the self-styled “gateway to the outback”. Longreach, about 1,100km north-west of Brisbane, is a magnet for “grey nomads”, middle-aged travellers passing through on caravan odysseys. Backpackers from Paris and London on working holidays pull beers at the local pubs. The funk of animals held in trucks and train carriages lingers on the edge of town. The sun is scorching even in winter. Bureau of Meteorology figures indicate Longreach and its surrounds are suffering worst of all in the current drought. There have been drier places over the past two years, namely the perennially parched Birdsville and Boulia on the fringes of Australia’s red-desert centre. But in Longreach just 312mm of rain fell in the 24 months to April – 64% below its long-term average. Thus Longreach appears “the town that is furthest below normal”, according to Blair Trewin of the bureau’s climate-monitoring section. A local agriculture department expert, David Phelps, says while Longreach folk may not be aware of the statistics, a visit by the prime minister, Tony Abbott, (who copped a serve in the Longreach Leader newspaper for failing to cover up with a broad-brimmed hat) was enough to indicate they were at the “fair dinkum epicentre of the drought”. The warnings over climate change raise the prospect of more frequent and prolonged droughts like this. But the stoic attitude of many farmers to this kind of future is typified in the views of another Longreach grazier, Phillip Owens: “We certainly live in an arid part of Australia and we have come to expect floods and famines. Climate’s certainly continually changing and I don’t think we can ignore the science behind it. For whatever reason it is what it is and we’ve just got to learn to cope with it.” Owens and his wife Lyn de-stocked their property Dundee some time ago. In fact only a smattering of beasts remains throughout the entirety of this famed cattle and wool district, which lies almost exactly at the centre of Queensland. From the air, the plains around Longreach are now a patchwork of burnt orange and charcoal swirls. The orange is the dirt, the swirls are patches of native Mitchell grass, dead or dying as roots two metres deep grasp vainly for water.     A dam bottoms out on a cattle property in Longreach. Just 312mm of rain fell in Longreach in the 24 months to April 2015 – 64% below its long-term average. Photograph: Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images    In better times, the Mitchell grass serves as what a stock management consultant, Desiree Jackson, describes as “meat and potatoes” for cattle on the plains. Two and a half years of no rain to speak of has reduced the grass to dark stubble with the nutritional value of cardboard. Only winter rain can spark the growth of “herbages”, which Jackson says is like “ice cream” for cattle.  Not that there will be anything much apart from kangaroos to enjoy the ice cream. Kangaroos, the symbol of Qantas, the national airline born in Longreach, are regarded as pests by local farmers who can see the quick-breeding marsupials wipe out their cattle fodder before they can even get hoofs back to pasture. Jackson says the shotgun remains the most humane method available of controlling the kangaroos. A farmer might gain a permit to shoot 1,000.  For now, many kangaroos are dropping dead of thirst and hunger around Longreach’s drier parts. But Button estimates there are at least 10,000 on Crossmoor alone, where they can avail themselves of what Button describes as “an abundance of beautiful bore water from the Great Artesian Basin”. But no amount of water infrastructure can provide enough irrigation to revive the Mitchell grass on an 80,000 hectare property. For that, the heavens are required. Showing how quickly fortunes can turn, Button says 2013, owing to rain the previous year, was “still quite a good year”. There has been no rainfall of note since then. Button, who has herself run cattle properties since 1971, has never encountered a dry like this. At the beginning of 2014, she had 1,800 breeding cows. Within months the family made the decision to get them all off the property into agistment – paying to graze them on greener routes elsewhere. Another dry summer has forced their hand. Last Thursday they sold “preg-tested” breeders and trucked them away. This week they will muster their final 500 cows and calves in two sweeps of Crossmoor.

Photograph: Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images    Button took over the property in 1991 with her husband, Ian, from a partnership that included a Brisbane chemist. They had run a cattle and sheep operation 20 years earlier on a property called Welford, further to the south-west near Windorah. It was drier but more provident country for grazing, Button says. They lived in a formidable mud-brick abode which featured built-in shooting vantage points – relics of an earlier time of warfare between white settlers on the frontier and the dispossessed Indigenous people of south-west Queensland. The founding property owner, Richard Welford, the son of an English barrister, was murdered by an Indigenous employee while building cattle yards in the 1880s.  The couple shifted the Crossmoor homestead from near the front entrance to the property just off the road to a hill 8km back. Button wryly recalls the blunt country humour her husband invoked at the time: “You don’t want your house near the main road. People might steal your tools and take your wife. Then you’d need to lock up your tools.” Since Ian’s death in 2006, it is his wife who runs the whole operation with her son Hugh and his bride Amanda.  Dressed in a white T-shirt and jeans, Button has a worldly, cultivated air and an eye for aesthetics. “I am determined to have a standard of lifestyle here that people can have in the city, a nice house and garden, and whatnot,” she says. The hallway in her homestead is the size of many city living rooms. “The old boys were pretty generous,” Button says.  The magnificent home and the outdoor adventures that beckon beyond it make up what she says is “a lovely life, and a lovely life for kids”. The family loves to have friends visit, especially with children from the city. Button’s rose bushes are a casualty of the big dry but the grass lawn stands up still to the salt of bore water. The pool remains full. The homestead once hosted a dozen employees who worked the property. A long wooden table on the veranda that Button dug out for a dinner party – once used to feed all those men – is a relic from that past. Now the farm is run by the most efficient unit imaginable: a three-person crew of Button, Hugh and Amanda. Asked about running Crossmoor, an 32,000 hectare expanse with its boundaries stretching up to 20km from the house, Button jokes: “It’s just a little place, this one.” Welford was four times the size. Button concedes that were the money there for it, more workers would be welcome. “Ideally we’d like to have a bit more of a hand because we just don’t draw breath,” she says.  “We still have a lovely life but there’s lots of weekends we do a lot of work. We spend an enormous amount of time on maintenance. Fences, yards, vehicles, motorbikes, it all needs maintenance.” Graziers like Button can expect at best around $2.20 a kilogram for every beast of theirs that winds up in a meatworks. At the other end of the supply chain, a punter buying a steak in a restaurant in Brisbane would easily pay the equivalent of $160 a kilogram. Like all graziers, Button wonders where the margin goes in between.  “We’re probably bad businessmen,” she says, adding that hardly any of this class of “price takers” competes among themselves. But she says: “We’re very independent. I wouldn’t want to live anywhere else.” Asked if a life of physical work keeps her young, she replies, amused: “Well I don’t know. Sometimes I don’t think so. But the doctor told me I was in the top 30% of my age the other day. I was pretty chuffed about that.” Button oversees the musters herself from the cockpit of her Cessna light aircraft, performing a role filled in times past by four men on horseback. She normally relishes the experience, which begins in the “early morning daylight”.     Another day begins in Longreach, with the sun set to scorch the earth once more. Photograph: Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images    “The weather is just ideal as far as the coolness, the clear morning, it’s just perfection,” she says. “With me the only person in the plane, the plane flies so easily. Because you’re not in a built-up area, it’s very relaxing, there’s not too much radio procedure. And if you have a visitor that comes in a plane, they can just taxi up to the back door. That’s pretty nice.” Spotting the cattle from overhead, Button relays positions to Hugh and Amanda on the ground on their motorbikes, who bring in the beasts with the help of a team of six kelpies. Though some graziers’ children are discouraged from staying on the land, Hugh chose at 21 to give up life as a builder in Brisbane to return to the family farm. Through him, Button can see past the drought to the continuation of the family’s life on the land. “He’s keen as mustard and it’s just wonderful he wants to do that,” Button says. “Hugh’s a new-wave grazier, well-educated, fresh and modern ideas, and can see a real future on the land.” Unprecedented though the drought may be, Button says it was one of the “foreseeable” factors for graziers. “Somehow we have to all just suck it up.” But an unforeseeable event, the Gillard government’s banning of the live cattle trade in 2011 after revelations of cruelty in Indonesian abattoirs, was one of many factors contributing to a perfect storm conspiring against the rural economy, Button says. The influx of those beasts to domestic markets reduced prices by about a third, limiting returns at a time when farmers were trying to bounce back from the “millennium drought” – and unknowingly on the verge of something worse. David Phelps says three-quarters of the Mitchell grass is likely to be dead. The rest could take two summers to recover, assuming the rain comes. For the plains around Longreach to have taken on this hue of “deathly grey” for more than two years is uncharted territory, he says.    Most people have become very resilient – they have to be. It is an amazing feature of rural people  Penny Button     Some graziers thought they were “drought-proofing” themselves by buying properties as far apart as Mount Isa and Longreach, Phelps says. But the breadth of this drought has put paid to that. Those who expanded through bank loans when the last drought broke “didn’t get to breed or trade their way out”, he says.  Mark McGovern, an economist at the Queensland University of Technology, says the willingness of banks to lend during an outback property boom made for a “textbook” subprime mortgage crisis. As property values drop, triggering loan-to-valuation ratios that prompt banks to step in, a handful of graziers in Longreach and more elsewhere have gone to the wall. Button is confident her family farm, now stripped of its productive income, has the ability to pull through. Her sympathy goes out to the others who, having overextended financially in a forlorn attempt to expand, will find it harder to survive.  The Queensland Liberal National party senator Barry O’Sullivan says he expects more farms to fall and he sees moral hazard in an attempt by government to save them. Locals talk of banks already sizing up repossessions even as a moratorium on seizures is under way. Some see glimmers of consolation. Phelps says family operations that have voluntarily given up income by unloading their cattle have made the right choice, allowing land the time to properly recover. Longreach in the 1960s was “by all reports a dust bowl”, when drought-stricken farmers allowed cattle to eat up virtually every last stalk of grass, he says. Button says she feels “both sides of politics” have let rural Australia down. She says the absence of any real plan to develop outback Queensland – the last major dam being five decades ago – overshadows any number of drought-relief loan schemes of dubious value to savvy rural operators with an eye on horizons longer than five years. But Button says it is inevitably the graziers’ responsibility to put enough away in good times to hold on in the droughts they know will always come. If nothing else, droughts could be an opportunity for a farmer normally bound by the routine of working the land to “go away and do something else, like take a holiday”, she says. “You mustn’t get too consumed by it,” she says. “Most people have become very resilient – they have to be. “It is an amazing feature of rural people. People are determined to survive and determined to make the best of the situation. Resilience comes with time and because people have to be. But that is easier for some than others.”",2015-05-27T01:18:51Z,"Scorched earth: at the epicentre of the Queensland drought, a family sells the last of their cattle","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""1c04b7972281dbca7f1ecad64ed7e0c828de1762""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/1c04b7972281dbca7f1ecad64ed7e0c828de1762/0_123_3264_1958/1000.jpg"" alt=""Penny Button, the owner of Crossmoor cattle property near Longreach, Queensland.

"Some people blame California’s enduring drought on the nut farmers. Others vent against those in Beverly Hills, who keep their estates green while neighbours in the flatlands turn off sprinklers under threat of heavy fines. Now comes the latest, perhaps inevitable, scapegoat: immigration. A group called Californians for Population Stabilization, which has courted controversy down the years, says it’s a matter of simple mathematics. The state now has nearly 40 million residents, 10 million or so more than it did 25 years ago, and a lot of the new arrivals are from other countries.  Therefore, they argue, it’s their fault. “California’s drought could have been prevented with responsible immigration policies and limited population growth,” one of the group’s recent Facebook posts reads. Another says, more ominously: “The drought has never been just about water.” No policymaker or environmental scientist is taking this line of argument terribly seriously – one climatologist told the Los Angeles Times bluntly it “didn’t fit the facts” – but it speaks to a growing anxiety among Californians of all income levels and political creeds that their way of life could be seriously threatened if it doesn’t start raining soon. Just as environmentalist campaigners are inclined to blame water-bottling giants like Nestle, and cities competing for water resources with farmers are inclined to blame agriculture, anti-immigration campaigners are happy to use the drought as grist to a well-established mill. Already last year, Californians for Population Stabilization, or Caps, ran a television advertisement to coincide with Earth Day in which a boy was depicted complaining about the lack of water and overcrowding. “Let’s slow immigration and save some California for tomorrow,” the ad concluded. Politicians and advocacy organizations hostile to immigration have struggled much harder in California than they have in, say, neighbouring Arizona, because the population is much more diverse; Latinos and other nonwhite population groups are climbing up the social and political ladders; and there is widespread recognition that without immigrant labour the state’s crops would not get picked, its children would not have nannies, and those well-watered Beverly Hills lawns would have nobody to take proper care of them. Policymakers and analysts do not always agree on how to manage the drought, but their debates tend to be about groundwater, the allocation of agricultural land and cutting urban waste. Population size has barely featured in their discussions. While protesters have risen up against Nestle and other bottled water manufacturers, the manufacturers themselves point out that their industry accounts for a tiny fraction of overall water use. Almond farmers struggling with the inconvenient fact that it takes a gallon of water to produce a single almond will sometimes point out that an ounce of beef requires 106 gallons. The media has not been immune from its own territorial impulses. In the wake of the devastating rains pounding Texas and Oklahoma, the LA Times ran a headline saying the floods “fuel hope for California drought relief”. One outraged Texan characterised the tenor of the piece as: “Lives have been lost but, hey, we can keep our almonds.”",2015-05-26T22:34:02Z,Some Californians have found a new drought scapegoat: immigration,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""a34571f7cee281e7d359f53f0b12e99a9b55f31a""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/a34571f7cee281e7d359f53f0b12e99a9b55f31a/0_44_3600_2160/1000.jpg"" alt=""Irrigation pipes sit along a dry ditch."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">‘The drought has never been just about water,’ according to a Facebook post from the group.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Rich Pedroncelli/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>",32,"Group called Californians for Population Stabilization says it’s a matter of simple mathematics, with 10 million more people living in the state than 25 years ago",http://media.guim.co.uk/a34571f7cee281e7d359f53f0b12e99a9b55f31a/0_44_3600_2160/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/26/california-drought-immigration,1,neutral
"Farmers have won generous tax discounts for drought preparedness while rural communities will benefit from an Australia-wide electorate-based funding program called “stronger communities” under changes announced in the budget. Farmers will be able to fully deduct the unlimited capital costs of fencing and water facilities to improve drought preparedness, the 2015 budget says. Water facilities include infrastructure such as dams, tanks, bores, irrigation channels, pumps, water towers and windmills. The accelerated depreciation package is expected to cost $70m over the next four years. It also allows farmers to depreciate capital costs on fodder storage assets such as silos and tanks over three years. Currently, fencing has been depreciated over 30 years, fodder storage over 50 years and water facilities over three years. The agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce, said the changes, which apply from 2016-17, would mean “more money in farmers’ pockets sooner”. “Drought preparedness was a key priority identified as part of the agriculture competitiveness white paper process and these accelerated depreciation measures will create an incentive for farmers to undertake on-farm preparedness activities and increase productivity,” Joyce said. The new measure adds to a $333m drought support package released last weekend by the prime minister, Tony Abbott. It included a $35m infrastructure and employment package for drought-affected communities, $25.8m for pest and weed management, $20m to increase access to mental health and community support services, and an extra $1.8m to the rural financial counselling service. The government will also roll over existing funding for the current concessional loan schemes for a further 12 months to 30 June 2016. It has also committed to a “stronger communities” package worth $22.5m a year to deliver “social benefits to the local community”. Every federal electorate will share $150,000 a year over two years for programs to support local cohesion and participation. The budget papers say the programs will be identified “in consultation” with local members and that successful grants must be completed within two years from 1 July 2015. Grants of between $1,000 and $20,000 will be available to “community organisations that are reputable and genuinely not for profit”. The program comes on top of the $1bn stronger regions fund, which replaced Labor’s regional development grants for economic development. While the regional development Australia committees still exist, the government has cut $3.6m from their “activities”. The government notes the savings will be redirected to “repair the budget”.",2015-05-12T11:22:54Z,Farmers get tax discounts in budget for drought preparedness assistance,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""5d163b9c027a52ae9345347690b0eb5206371c1c""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/5d163b9c027a52ae9345347690b0eb5206371c1c/0_135_4256_2555/1000.jpg"" alt=""Farmers get generous tax discounts in the 2015 Australian budget, including being able to deduct unlimited capital costs of fencing and water facilities to improve drought preparedness."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Farmers get generous tax discounts in the 2015 Australian budget, including being able to deduct unlimited capital costs of fencing and water facilities to improve drought preparedness.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: The Age/Fairfax Media via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",33,"Those on the land to be allowed to deduct full costs of fencing and water infrastructure, while communities offered grants to support cohesion",http://media.guim.co.uk/5d163b9c027a52ae9345347690b0eb5206371c1c/0_135_4256_2555/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/may/12/farmers-get-tax-discounts-in-budget-for-drought-preparedness-assistance,1,positive
"Queensland is suffering the most widespread drought in the state’s history, as drought declarations spread across more than 80% of its land. The state government has added another four council areas to the list of drought-declared areas following a patchy wet season and the weather bureau’s declaration of an El Niño event that will result in hotter and drier conditions. The total area of Queensland that’s drought declared is 80.35%, eclipsing the previous record of 79.01% in March 2014 – during the same drought. The state’s agriculture and fisheries minister, Bill Byrne, said one of the four new declared areas, parts of Mareeba shire on the Atherton tablelands, had not been in drought since 1979. “While several coastal areas received good rainfall and are having their drought status revoked, I am declaring a further large part of the state drought-stricken, particularly in north Queensland,” Byrne said in a statement on Wednesday. The other new drought areas were near the Gulf of Carpentaria: Burke, Carpentaria and Doomadgee. Byrne said current drought funding would remain in place until 2018 and be reviewed “as necessary”.  The drought relief assistance scheme includes funding for farm freight and rebates for “emergency water infrastructure” alongside a $13m federal fund for the same. The federal government has separately granted $113m in loans to Queensland farmers so far during the current drought.

"  Related: California accepts historic offer by farmers to cut water usage by 25%    An inflatable dam in drought-stricken California was damaged on Thursday, causing the loss of nearly 50,000,000 gallons (190m litres) of water.  Police said vandals caused “irreversible damage” to the inflatable dam in Fremont, a city in the San Francisco Bay Area. The vandalism caused water meant for local residents to instead flow into San Francisco bay.  The Alameda County water district said the lost water could have supplied 500 homes for an entire year.  “This is a very significant loss of water under any circumstances, and more so in the drought conditions we are experiencing,” said ACWD’s general manager, Robert Shaver. “It is an utterly senseless, destructive, and wasteful thing to do.” Police said that the vandals entered a restricted area on Thursday and intentionally damaged the dam. By Saturday, no one had been arrested in connection with the incident.  The water agency said it would cost $3m to replace the dam, but said it did not expect that the damage would have a long-term impact on the water supply for Fremont, Newark and Union City. Once officials were alerted to the damage, water workers were able to divert water from other sources to stop any further loss. California’s state water board announced on Friday that it had accepted a deal from farmers to cut back their water use as the state endures its fourth year of drought. The deal came as the board warned it would employ mandatory cuts if the two parties could not reach an agreement.

"A global weather phenomenon could cause a famine in the Sahel this year by combining with already dry conditions to create a “double whammy” for the region, scientists and aid groups have warned. Professor Adam Scaife, a long term forecaster at the UK Met Office Hadley Centre, said models now agreed an El Niño event was likely and the first impacts may be felt as early as June. El Niño is caused by a reversal of trade winds in the Pacific that allow warm water to spread east, across the ocean. The two to seven year cycle plays havoc with weather across the world.  “[A] place that’s really important to stress is west Africa, where there is increased risk of drought during El Niño. That is exacerbated this year by some conditions [including] cooling of the North Atlantic,” he said.       In west Africa, Scaife said conditions were aligning in a similar way to the massive 1972 drought that devastated the Sahel with famine. During this event, drying from El Niño tipped the region into full blown drought.  Scaife said the current parched conditions combined with further warming and drying from El Niño would be a “double whammy”. Oxfam’s west Africa regional director Aboubacry Tall said the partial failure of the 2014 rainy season had left between 300,000 and 400,000 people in the Sahel without access to a secure food supply.       Speaking to the Guardian from Sierra Leone, Tall said the first rains of 2015 began to fall just a few days ago and Met Office predictions of a drought as early as June were deeply concerning for people awaiting crop-growing rain in the sub-Saharan areas of northern Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Mali, northern Senegal and Mauritania. “If this rainy season is disrupted then the consequences would be quite drastic because even this year we have some gaps. If you have a second generalised failure of crops across the region you will certainly have the early set in of a food crisis or possibly a famine in the Sahel,” he said.  On Wednesday, US president Barack Obama linked the violence and terror being wrought in Nigeria by Boko Haram to severe drought in the Sahel. It has been reported that young men have joined the al-Qaeda affiliated group after being displaced by food shortages. In the neighbouring coastal countries mounting a fragile recovery from ebola, Scaife said the effect of a possible El Niño was less clear. These areas are traditionally wetter and are more resistant to fluctuations in rainfall. “If anything it is more likely wetter on the Guinea coastline,” he said. This news will come as a relief in countries where people have been driven from their farms and food production has dropped significantly. “If El Niño was to [cause drought] on top of Ebola in affected countries it would certainly be a significant catastrophe in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. It would put back any hope of recovery by at least another year,” said Tall. Apart from Africa, El Niño could also bring dry conditions could in Australia and India during the next few months. In California, wet conditions could put an end to the state’s worst drought in 1200 years. In 2014 many forecasters predicted an El Niño but it never materialised. Scaife said the Met Office modelling did not give the false alarm that led other agencies to make the wrong call. “There was not unanimous agreement that the risk was increased. This year is different. All of the forecast systems that I’ve looked at show a clear increase in risk of at least a moderate El Niño event,” he said. Earlier this month the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared an El Niño. In the past week a strong pulse of eastward winds has emerged in the west Pacific. “If anything that’s going to strengthen it even further,” said Scaife. Professor Eric Guilyardi, from Reading University’s National Centre for Atmospheric Science said the current levels of warming in the Pacific were higher than before the largest recorded El Niño in 1997-98, although this does not guarantee an extreme event. “[An extreme event] is not the most likely outcome but the risk is increased,” he said. “What is specific this year is the level of warming at this time of the year is pretty high. We have to go back to 1987 to see such levels of warming at this time of the year,” said Guilyardi. El Niños are known to temporarily raise the global temperature. Last year was the hottest on record. The global surface temperature was 0.57C above average, despite the aborted El Niño. Scaife said the first months of 2015 were already running an extremely high temperature, with temperatures currently at 0.64C above average.",2015-05-21T14:13:21Z,"El Niño could bring drought and famine in west Africa, scientists warn","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""a4298826c1bea4418762d66703948256eddd5256""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432217274338/ae127ea4-ef69-4531-b7a3-8ac911e84d72-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""People walk past a dry riverbed in the Matam region of northeastern Senegal in the Sahel region of North Africa.

"An astonishing 12.5m trees have died in California, unable to survive a harsh fourth year of drought, according to a US government study. The news of the massive tree die-offs came this week, after the United States Forest Service, a Department of Agriculture agency, released the results of an aerial survey it undertook in April over 8.2m acres of forest. The survey was organized three months ahead of schedule.  “The special early season aerial survey was prompted by knowledge of the worsening drought situation and reports from field crews that copious amounts of new mortality had appeared after the regular survey was flown in July of 2014,” explained Jeffrey Moore, a biologist with the agency who was one of the surveyors on the expedition. The California drought has now entered its fourth year. On 1 April, California governor Jerry Brown imposed the first set of mandatory water use restriction measures – a step never before taken in the state’s history. Brown said the drought had reached “near-crisis” levels.     The dead trees add to the flammability of a drying landscape that is increasingly threatened by large, intense wildfires. Photograph: David McNew/Getty Images    Moore, the US Forest Service biologist, called the death of millions of trees “a cause for concern”. Aerial photos from the survey show a landscape of red, purple and brown trees – the dead ones – interspersed among the usual green. Even those green ones were sometimes lighter and yellower than usual, a sign of distress. These are a mix of colors more usually associated with autumn in New England. But the scenes depicted were hardly romantic. Yellow and pale beige dry-looking earth laid the scene for dead pine and oak trees, still standing among their struggling-to-survive forest companions. The sudden prevalence of such an abnormal amount of dead trees in California’s forests – a scale of loss not seen since the 1970s droughts – has raised concern more broadly about the increased risks of wildfires. “Increased fire risk, already extremely high, at least over the short term is also a serious concern. Freshly killed trees are dry tinder that have the potential to make fires hotter and spread faster,” Moore said. Fire fighters battled more than 5,000 wildfires last year in California, over a thousand more than usual. Last Saturday marked National Wildfire Preparedness Day. Appearing before the press to raise awareness about the upcoming wildfire season, California fire department chief Ken Pimlott not only congratulated those residents living close to forest areas for not wasting water by watering their lawns, he also invited good citizens to take things one step further and rip their lawns out entirely. Just like dead trees, dead lawns increase the temperatures and spreading powers of fires. A lack of water is not the only reason for trees dying en masse. With trees weakened and their sticky resin defense mechanisms down, the last nails in the coffin are often bark beetles. Bark beetles, which are individually no larger than a grain of rice, move in when trees are stressed, weakened or injured. As they eat, they finish the tree off. With beetle colonies expanding as the availability of food does, the current California drought also means there is a risk of massive, exacerbated bark beetle activity. According to the US Department of Agriculture, a thriving bark beetle population, emboldened and enlarged by dying-tree feed, may then be able to turn, through “mass attacks”, to completely healthy trees and successfully destroy those. But Moore warned against too much alarmism. The worst affected areas were fringe ones – harsh sites by tree standards. Trees are surviving in most areas and may even be healthier as a result of some of the deaths, with less competition for the available moisture, Moore said.

"At this time of year the fields around Mendota, the self-described “cantaloupe capital of the world”, should be green, hissing with sprinklers and humming with tractors. Labourers should be on buses criss-crossing lanes and highways as they plant cantaloupe and tend crops of alfalfa, cotton, wheat, tomato and broccoli. Instead, as far as the eye can see, the earth is brown and the landscape deserted. No tractors or buses, barely a sign of human activity, only stillness. The sound of drought is silence. As California enters its fourth parched year a hush has descended on this agricultural community, a mix of mainly white farmers and Latino labourers in the Central Valley 230 miles north of Los Angeles. “It’s a lot quieter. You have an empty feeling,” said Todd Allen, a third-generation farmer who has laid off most of his workers and fallowed all his 473 acres. “There’s not that much to do except maintenance.” His skeleton crew spends its days battling morning glory – “the terrible weed with the beautiful name” – whose roots can burrow more than 20ft, sucking what little moisture remains in the soil. It is about the only thing thriving. The drought is reaping a heavy toll on farmers, forcing some to sell land and consider bankruptcy, and labourers, who are sliding deeper into poverty. Adaptation is proving painful and uncertain. “If people don’t have water it’ll just turn into a desert again,” said Allen, 52, as he surveyed a field of baked, barren earth on his farm, 10 miles outside Mendota. “That’s what this was before they built the whole system.” That system – a network of reservoirs, aqueducts, pumps and canals to supplement rain, rivers and snowmelt – has broken down amid what climate scientists say is one of the worst dry spells in centuries.     Mendota, California   Some reservoirs, such as Lake McClure, are down to 10% capacity. State officials cancelled a trek to the Sierra Nevada to measure snowpack last week because there was no snow.  Snowpack supplies about 30% of California’s water supply when it melts in late spring and summer, replenishing reservoirs. An April measurement showed snowpack water content at just 5% of what is normal for that time period. It is now thought to be down to 3% – half an inch. “Major reservoirs are dropping at a time when they typically would be filling with melted snow,” Mark Cowin, director of California’s department of water resources, warned in a statement. “We need careful, sparing use of water across the state, because we don’t know when this drought will end.” To help meet a state-wide target of a 25% cut in water use, Governor Jerry Brown has ordered a series of measures, including ripping up 50m square feet of lawns and daily fines of up to $10,000 for water wasters. “We are embarked upon an experiment that no one has ever tried,” Brown said last month, when he announced rationing. For residents in coastal cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco, drought blares from headlines but, so far, has barely affected daily life. For those who depend on the fields around Mendota, however, it has unleashed what feels like an existential struggle. Allen’s grandfather, an immigrant from Sweden, worked as a ranch-hand, building canals to irrigate crops, before buying his own land. By the 1970s and 1980s plentiful water – from rain and state-supplied allocation – helped the family farm thrive. “My dad had an airplane. It was like living the American dream,” said Allen.     A sign at Todd Allen’s farm suggests the state has its priorities wrong. Photograph: Rory Carroll for the Guardian    Trouble began in the 1990s, he said, when officials started allocating less water to farmers in order to protect the delta smelt and other threatened fish species. The Allens gradually moved to more efficient irrigation – from furrow, to sprinkler, to drip – and weathered the 2007 to 2009 drought, when the state reduced water supplies. But the latest drought has cut that supply entirely, leaving this married father of two to gaze at cloudless skies, wondering if rain will ever return, and to eye his savings, wondering if he can afford $500,000 to drill a well more than 1,000ft deep, joining a scramble for groundwater. Scientists have expressed alarm at the quantity being sucked up. Such deep water, in any case, is of lousy quality, said Allen. “Pretty salty. It would kill the trees eventually.” California’s water system was built for human beings, not the smelt, he said. “When you put this worthless two-inch fish in front of me and my family, that’s wrong. It’s insanity.”    When you put this worthless two-inch fish in front of me and my family, that’s wrong. It’s insanity       Environmentalists dispute that, saying the smelt is a barometer for a fragile, embattled ecosystem in San Francisco bay’s delta. Allen sold a chunk of land last year to deep-pocketed pistachio growers and may sell more to put his adolescent daughters through college. “My wife doesn’t let me whine and complain. She says we need to count our blessings.” The labourers of Mendota have rather fewer blessings. The impoverished, dusty town, made up almost entirely of migrants from El Salvador and Mexico, has never had it easy, let alone lived the American dream. About half the 11,000 residents live below the poverty line. Two out of three students do not graduate from high school. Agricultural swings batter the economy. A good year keeps unemployment to about 20%, four times the national average. A bad year sees it soar to 50%. A Guardian tour of the area via Route 33 last week turned up just one working crew, 16 men and women in jeans and baseball caps who fanned across an alfalfa field, a rare patch of green nourished by a nearby well.     A rusting water pipe in one of Todd Allen’s fallow fields. Photograph: Rory Carroll for the Guardian    Before the drought there would have been dozens more people out here planting lettuce, tomatoes, melon and cotton, said José Flores, 40, the foreman, perspiring in 90-degree heat. “If this continues we’ll move to other states.” Many had already migrated to slaughterhouse jobs in Minnesota, said Flores. At midday unemployed labourers lounged in the centre of town, a sleepy collection of sun-bleached one-storey homes and businesses. “When the pool hall opens we go there,” said one man, leaning against a wall for shade. He declined to give his name. “And when the food truck comes we go there,” said Isabel Méndez, 62. It comes once a month and she missed the last one, she said. “I got the day wrong.” Officials have blamed unemployment for spikes in crime and drunkenness. The mayor and city manager did not respond to interview requests. Local businesses reported sharply reduced revenues. “Customers can’t spend anything compared to two years ago,” said Ali Mohsen, who owns a phone shop. The exception was Johnny Amador, a flower and balloon seller. Latino culture mandated families to celebrate birthdays and other occasions, he said. “They’ll do what it takes. Save, haggle, ask for credit.” He shook his head. “We don’t do credit anymore. We’ve had enough people burn us.”",2015-05-05T16:36:29Z,"California drought brings sound of silence to baked, barren farms","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""2fd7a0e6771a3c07d3721426f88ee30f90e829a0""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/5/1430841164573/7f8f3bad-b35a-4c05-a460-1e7eeefbe83c-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""todd allen california farmer mendota"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Farmer Todd Allen stands amid his 473 acres of fallow fields near Mendota, California.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Rory Carroll for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>",38,The Central Valley should be a hive of activity but in the state’s fourth dry year farmers count their losses and labourers stand idle beneath cloudless skies,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/5/1430841164857/c3313c31-49d8-48f3-8690-04b7e9c7eed2-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/05/california-drought-farms-silence,4,neutral
"Amid what is normally considered the rainy season, Brazil, the home of the Amazon River, is suffering from a historic, punishing drought.  In a country accustomed to ample water supplies, neighbors are turning against neighbors and hoarding water as taps run dry while businesses close and protesters take to the streets. Some have even speculated that São Paulo, one of the world’s largest cities, is failing.  The costs of a drought are many – water rationing, fines for consumption and constraints on agriculture and industrial production. But for Brazil, a water shortage also leads to another problem: more than 75% of Brazil’s power comes from hydroelectric sources, making it second only to China in reliance on hydroelectric power.  The water crisis is pushing Brazil to take extreme measures to save water even as low water levels are decimating its hydropower supplies, leading to rolling power cuts across the country. With its rainforest, favelas and megacities, Brazil is a huge piece of the puzzle for many of the world’s biggest sustainability goals, and the country has loomed large in environmental discussions since it held the Rio+20 climate talks in 2012.  Water courses through many of Brazil’s biggest sustainability challenges. Not only does water rationing exacerbate the divide between rich and poor in the highly stratified country, but water pollution and water quality issues are threatening the country’s next turn on the world stage: the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, which arrive just two years after the 2014 FIFA World Cup.  Pollution in Guanabara Bay, where Olympic sailing and windsurfing contests are scheduled to be held, is so bad that competitors have described it as an “open sewer”. More than 40 tons of dead fish have been removed from a lake slated to host the rowing contests.  Preparations for the Olympics are suffering from widespread dissatisfaction after last year’s FIFA World Cup. The massive investments to build stadiums and host as many as a million football tourists for the soccer blowout sparked large protests from city residents left out of the economic boom, who complain they are paying higher costs of living without seeing increased services.  Brazil is in many ways an island nation unto itself – it’s practically its own Portuguese-speaking continent amid the sea of Spanish Latin America. But it also faces challenges that are familiar across the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) countries: social inequality, human rights, energy, water, and climate change are all taking a toll on the country’s present and future.      A resident and his dog walk across the drying bottom of the Paraibuna dam, part of the Cantareira water system that provides greater São Paulo with most of its water. Photograph: Roosevelt Cassio/Reuters    Add to these the importance of caring for the Amazon rainforest – the “lungs of the planet”, which stores more carbon dioxide than anywhere else on Earth – and it becomes clear why social and environmental progress in Brazil is at least as important as its economic growth. Deforestation in the Amazon Basin has long been a thorn in Brazil’s side. Not only do numerous human rights and indigenous peoples’ rights threats arise from deforestation, but researchers recently directly connected Amazonian deforestation to the horrific drought in southern Brazil. Fortunately, there is some good news. Over the past decade, Brazil has lowered its carbon dioxide output more than any other country through a historic effort to slow forest loss: it reduced deforestation 18% last year. Now, other countries are trying to follow Brazil’s lead in the war on tropical deforestation.    Related: Why Brazil's megadrought is a Wall Street failure    During Cop 20, the UN climate change conference in Lima last year, Brazilian authorities announced a plan to develop a monitoring system in partnership with the Amazon Cooperation Treat Organization. Around $8m will be spent in satellite data analysis, training, and equipment to be used for monitoring deforestation in all seven countries that are part of the group. Brazil’s megacities also have become home to many of the innovations and disruptions taking root in the US and Europe. Startups working under the banner of the sharing economy such as Uber and Airbnb have found a home in Rio and São Paulo. The B Corporation social and environmental business certification launched in Brazil in 2012 as Sistema B, and just two years later became the home of the world’s first publicly traded B Corp as cosmetics maker Natura earned Sistema B certification. While environmental stewardship is a less-than-common commitment among large Brazilian companies or multinationals doing business in Brazil, the country is host to a thriving social entrepreneurship sector. A number of social entrepreneurship funds operate across Brazil, bankrolling small operations to fight poverty, inequality, and expand educational and economic opportunities among the poor and disadvantaged.

Photograph: Silvia Izquierdo/AP    Brazil casts a big shadow across South America, despite its continental size and generally inward focus. As Brazil’s development bank invests in more projects across its borders, it brings the promise of more economic opportunity to its less-wealthy neighbors – but also the risk of stepping on toes and stirring anti-Brazilian anger. Road-building projects in Guyana and Bolivia, a mining project in Argentina, and Brazilian emigration into Paraguay for agricultural projects have all recently incited opposition from neighboring governments and citizens. Just as Brazil weighs heavily across Latin America, it too lives in the shadow of China. Economically, the mid-2000s were Brazil’s golden years. The nation averaged a healthy 4% growth, propelled by high exports – particularly to China – as well as a spike in domestic consumption. During these boom times, Brazilians saw a bright future just over the horizon. Then came the 2008 global market crash.    Related: São Paulo – anatomy of a failing megacity: residents struggle as water taps run dry    As their export partners slowed their demand, Brazil’s economy followed suit: in 2009, the economy shrank for the first time since 1992, sending shockwaves throughout the country. The rise and fall and rise again of Brazil’s economy is taking place during what may turn out to be the pivotal moment in the global environmental movement. As Brazil responds to extreme drought, high-stakes deforestation, and pollution and human rights challenges, and as the country steps up to the world stage for the Olympics, its decisions will ripple not only to neighboring countries and the BRICs, but throughout the world. One example of this economic muscle-flexing is the recently proposed development of a new BRICs-led global development bank. Offered as an alternative to the World Bank and IMF, the New Development Bank proposed by China, Russia, India, Brazil and South Africa would emphasize sustainable development around the world without the punishing restrictions required by World Bank loans. While the aim of the NDB is to free BRICs and other developing economies from the status quo, observers caution that if the bank truly wants to change the course of sustainable development it must put human rights and the environment at the center of its charter.  Government, business, environmental and civil leaders will be watching closely to find out whether the country will end up being a model for sustainable development or a cautionary tale.

"The Colorado river and its tributaries took a hundred million years or two to carve the Glen Canyon out of the pink and scarlet sandstone which marks out the American southwest. Its myriad gorges, sheer cliffs and towering spires remained a largely hidden secret. Prehistoric peoples farmed part of the canyon and Navajo Indian communities built camps close to the river, but few modern Americans ventured there besides explorers until the canyon disappeared under a man-made wonder, the vast Lake Powell, with the construction of Glen Canyon dam half a century ago. Almost immediately, environmentalists and archaeologists mourned the loss. A final burst of exploration had turned up thousands of ancient ruins and drawn a belated focus on the canyon’s stunning natural architecture.   Related: Washington state declares drought emergency with $1.2bn in crops at risk    “Glen Canyon died in 1963,” wrote the renowned conservationist David Brower, who founded Friends of the Earth. “Neither you, nor I, nor anyone else knew it well enough to insist that at all costs it should endure. When we began to find out, it was too late.” But Lake Powell, the US’s second largest reservoir, proved its own marvel. It draws about three million tourists a year to boat, swim and take days on the water, exploring the crevices and side canyons of a lake that stretches nearly 190 miles across the border between Utah and Arizona. The otherworldly landscape of monumental rock piles and soaring sandstone cliffs has provided the backdrop for scenes in Planet of the Apes and Gravity, and for episodes of Doctor Who. After the dam was constructed at the southern tip of the canyon, the lake took more than a decade to fill with melting snow from the Rocky mountains flowing down the 1,450-mile Colorado river. That brought its own natural phenomenon. What locals nickname the “bathtub ring” runs for most of Lake Powell’s 1,900-mile shoreline, which is half as long again as the US west coast. The ring of white calcium carbonate absorbed into the rock from the water contrasts sharply with the deep colours of the sandstone.      Glen Canyon dam, north of the rural city of Page, Arizona, has seen a dramatic drop in water levels. The levels have dropped by more than 100 feet. Photograph: Jerry Burch/Demotix for the Guardian    These days, it also provides a dramatically visible marker of the crisis facing the Colorado river after years of diminishing snowfalls on the Rockies. Month by month, as water levels fall, more of the bathtub ring is exposed. Today, it towers 100ft or more above the boaters as what federal officials are describing as the worst drought in the Colorado Basin in a century diminishes a river that provides water to 40 million people in seven states. Lake Powell – a crucial cog in the machinery of water delivery – is at only 45% of capacity. Hidden treasures The falling water level has delivered up hidden treasures, the natural arches and narrow side canyons not seen in years. Perhaps the most spectacular is the Cathedral in the Desert, a multi-coloured sandstone arch forming a huge natural amphitheatre, with a waterfall lit by narrow beams of sunlight. In parts of the lake, new islands have emerged and old ones have become towering sandstone pillars. Shores once underwater are now lined with new beaches while old ones, left high above the waterline, are bristling with plants. As the water levels dropped, some of the boating arteries linking different parts of the lake could only be kept open by cutting through the rock. Erin Janicki, an aquatic biologist, has watched the change from the water’s edge. The town of Page, Arizona was built to house workers constructing the dam that flooded Glen Canyon. Janicki lives in one of the original houses, a stone’s throw from the lake. For nine years, she has seen the water rise and fall, but says the overall trend is down. “The water’s 110ft below the top of bathtub ring,” she said. “There are parts of the lake that have pretty much become mud flats. The inlets get silted up. It takes longer to jet around the lake because some of the waterways aren’t open and you have to go around obstacles.  “There’s still a lot of water out there, but there’s been a big change. People hit rock islands all the time.” For Janicki, this has raised questions about the nature of development in arid regions. “I don’t like seeing big developments in the desert,” she said. “These cities growing all the time. More people and less water. It doesn’t seem sustainable to me. Page has a golf course. Here, in the desert.” The Colorado river serves Wyoming ranches, Arizona agricultural plantations and Nevada’s gambling mecca, Las Vegas. It is crucial to the California food industry and growing desert cities across the southwest.   Related: California drought shaming takes on a class-conscious edge    What goes into Lake Powell is largely decided by how much snow falls on the Rockies in winter. But what comes out is governed by complex agreements made nearly a century ago, and adjusted over the years, which divvy up the river’s water between seven states. Under those agreements, Lake Powell serves in part as a reservoir for the states clustered around the Colorado river’s upper basin – Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico. It is also obliged to release specified amounts of water into its sister reservoir and the country’s largest, Lake Mead, 180 miles downriver. Lake Mead in turn provides water to seven out of 10 Nevada residents, to a vast construct of aqueducts serving Arizona plantations and cities, and to help slate the seemingly insatiable thirst of southern California.     A small heart of cattle stand in what once was a watering hole. Photograph: Jerry Burch/Demotix for the Guardian    But after 15 years of diminishing snow falls on the Rockies, the US government agency managing the Colorado river’s water, the Bureau of Reclamation, is now facing a difficult balancing act as levels in both lakes sink to record lows and rationing looms. “We all are depending on the snow pack on the Rockies and Lake Powell is the first reservoir,” said Rose Davis of the Bureau of Reclamation’s Upper Colorado region. “It doesn’t look very good. We have 56% of normal snowpack is the last reading that I saw. It’s just terrible.” The fall in water levels in Lake Mead are as dramatic as those in Lake Powell. It has dropped from over 90% of capacity in 2000 to less than 40%. In April, the water in Lake Mead fell to its lowest level since 1937 when it was still being filled after construction of the Hoover dam. “We are at a record low and we expect to drop even lower in the summer months,” said Davis. The immediate cause is the longest drought in a century. “This 15-year drought that we’re in is the worst drought in the last 100 years,” said Davis. “But we also have tree-ring studies going back to the year 1075 and this is the fourth-worst drought since 1075. So the drought and weather cycles have a natural variability to them but we’ve got data on warmer temperatures and climate change making a difference.  “We could get a crazy amount of snow this winter. We just don’t know. We had a good year in 2011 and it’s not unusual to have one good year in the middle of a drought but this is the longest one in the last 100 years.” Davis said the longest drought in the Colorado Basin of the past millennia lasted more than 60 years. Water conservation as a way of life     On the Navajo reservation near Page, Arizona, a young man looks at a water reservoir fed by a windmill. Photograph: Jerry Burch/Demotix for the Guardian    The southern edge of Lake Powell marks out part of the border of the sprawling Navajo Indian reservation in Arizona. John Begay’s farm sits farm sits alone just off the road south out of Page. At 74, he has watched the transformation of the canyon to a lake, and the rise and fall of the water. “There are people who talk about a drought but I don’t know if there’s a drought or not,” he said. “We don’t get rain like we used to in the 40s, 50s. The two best years were 1949 and 1967. After that it changed. I know it because of my animals. When there’s less rain we have to collect more water. There hasn’t been enough rain since I was a young man.  “We used to get a lot of snow. There’s not been much since 1980. Used to get eight or 10in. Not now.” All the talk of a crisis looming leaves Begay baffled. Like many people living in the sprawling, parched reservation lands, he has spent years conserving water. Seated on the worn wooden porch of the house he has lived in his entire life, he draws from a well run by the Navajo government, filling two 12,000 gallon tanks for his 45 head of beef. “I don’t know if there’s a drought or not,” he repeated. “People talk about drought. The Navajo council is having meetings about this. It doesn’t really change anything for us. We’ve always had to be careful with water here. Look, see how dry this place is.”   Related: Moronic irrigation: LA’s new turf war against its sprinkler-happy celebrities    Much of the reservation is scrub, offering sparse grazing for livestock and making hard work of growing anything more than food for the family. But Begay can at least rely on the well. Others on the reservation are forced to haul every drop they use. Although he lives with his family close to one of the US’s largest reservoirs, Dwight Denatsosie gets his water from a pump at the Shell petrol station in Page. He drops a handful of quarters into the machine to fill three 55-gallon drums on the back of his pickup truck. “I live near Coppermine. It’s real hot over there,” he said. “I need about 15 barrels a week. It depends on the livestock.” The water is cheap but there’s the cost of the fuel for the constant trips to collect it. His house, like those around it, is deemed too isolated to be on the mains. Denatsosie’s brother-in-law, Leraydo Gishie, helps him collect the water. “I grew up in a house with no running water and no electricity,” he said. They too are wary of the idea that the present water crisis is all down to a 15-year drought. Years ago, Denatsosie’s family ran a herd of livestock but the water holes they relied on dried up. One of them was filled by a pump run by a windmill. Looking into the 7ft-high holding tank next to it, there is little more than a few inches of water in the bottom. “A decade ago that was full. It’s not just the rain. The water isn’t coming out of the ground any more,” said Denatsosie. “We had to get rid of our goats and cows. It’s not just the water. Without the rain, there’s nothing for them to eat because nothing grows properly. Now we only have two horses.”  Deeper cuts     Water on the other side of the Glen Canyon dam shows a significant drop over the years from the lack of rain.  Photograph: Jerry Burch/Demotix for the Guardian    Last year, for the first time, the amount of water transferred from Lake Powell to Lake Mead was reduced, by enough to supply about 1.5m homes. If the snowpack on the Rockies is as bad as Davis fears, then there is likely to be a deeper cut in the coming months under a series of agreements which allocate water rights. The original agreement, the Colorado River Compact, carved out nearly a century ago, divides the river’s water between the states that rely on it. With hindsight, it sowed the seeds of some of today’s problems. It failed to foresee the rapid rise in population in the desert states of Nevada and Arizona, and the demands of their cities and farms. Nevada, for instance, was allocated only 2% of total of the water distribution. The compact was also premised on predictions of snow packs on the Rockies which some environmentalists have concluded were based on a period of abnormally high rains in the west during the first quarter of the 20th century. The agreement gives some states greater claim than others when the water runs short. Arizona loses out, except for a county next to the Mexican border which has what are known as “senior rights” because it produces much of the US vegetable crop in winter. Nevada also does badly. The big winner is California, which gets to keep its much larger allocation, for a while, at least. That state of affairs can be traced back nearly half a century to construction of the largest aqueduct system in the US to deliver the Colorado’s water to central and southern Arizona. The canals of the Central Arizona Project (CAP) provide water to cities such as Tucson and Phoenix, and irrigate close to 400,000 hectares (1m acres) of farmland. Without it, Arizona would be less fertile and, probably, less inhabited. But the CAP required the support of California’s members of Congress to win funding and they exacted a price – if the water is rationed, Arizona’s allocation is cut by half before California takes any hit at all. In 2007, seven years into the present drought, new allocations were signed by the US secretary of the interior in case the water shortages grew. The cutbacks to the states kicks in if Lake Mead falls below 1,075ft.  In April of this year it was just 4ft short of that benchmark as it fell to its lowest level since 1937, when the lake was still being filled. If the water levels continue to drop, Arizona and Nevada will face immediate cuts, escalating as the lake falls further. That would threaten cities such as Las Vegas and the very existence farms fed by the Arizona aqueduct. If the lake sinks below 1,000ft, the water intake pipes would start sucking air. The Hoover Dam power turbines would also stop spinning, interrupting an important source of electricity to the region. Davis said it’s a prospect that kicked state governments into gear. “We signed these guidelines in 2007, so all of the states have been very proactive in storing groundwater, implementing conservation measures, using recycling technologies. They have seen this coming,” she said. Nevada is recycling most of the water used by residents and tourists in Las Vegas. The Southern Nevada Water Authority put in place a conservation plan that includes limiting the size of lawns, restrictions on watering gardens and campaigns to shorten the time spent in showers or running dishwashers. The authority says it has reduced demand from about 314 gallons per person per day in 2002 to about 205 gallons per day last year, and saved 32bn gallons of water despite the region’s population rising by more than 500,000 people.   Related: Drought forces California into first mandatory rules to save water    California has been implementing a raft of measures, with new laws to come, to deal with a water crisis across the state beyond areas dependent on the Colorado river. Arizona has cut back water usage to levels last seen in the 1950s. If it comes to it, the state has had to set its own priorities. The cities will get first call over the farmers of central Arizona. Arizona also stashed surplus water in the years of plenty in underground water banks which should provide it with about two years of reserves, although it is a major operation to extract it. But all of that looks a relative sticking plaster next to the predictions made by some environmental studies that the Colorado river’s flow is permanently diminished. Some predict the volume of water coming off the Rocky mountains will fall by a further third by 2050. It’s not just what is on the surface that’s of concern. With less water coming off the mountains, farmers and local municipalities began drilling down to tap into the Colorado Basin’s aquifers. A study by the University of California, Irvine using Nasa satellites found that over the decade to the end of 2013, the Colorado basin lost 65 cubic kilometres, or 17 trillion gallons, of water – more than double the capacity of Lake Mead. The study describes water from the Colorado River Basin as the “most over allocated in the world”.  “Quite honestly, we are alarmed and concerned about the implications of our findings,” wrote one of the study’s authors, Jay Famiglietti. “From a group that studies groundwater depletion in the hottest of the hot spots of water stress around the world – in India, the Middle East, and in California’s Central Valley – that says something.”",2015-05-17T14:11:25Z,Disappearing Lake Powell underlines drought crisis facing Colorado river,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""4a68f26c38a2b430f7e2804497db0debda0c5398""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/4a68f26c38a2b430f7e2804497db0debda0c5398/164_0_3503_2104/1000.jpg"" alt=""lake powell colorado"" width=""1000"" height=""601"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">In Lake Powell, white calcium deposits show the extent to which the water level has dropped, around 100ft.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Chris McGreal for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>",40,"As water levels plummet to 45% in America’s second-largest reservoir, new islands appear – and fears grow for a waterway that serves 40 million people",http://media.guim.co.uk/8cd406b674722b7034a9d6669e62713c236b68ad/0_0_5616_3372/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/17/lake-powell-drought-colorado-river,3,neutral
"In California, a new season of drought brings a new season of drought shaming – or, for those using YouTube, Instagram, Twitter or the “community-minded” app VizSafe, #droughtshaming. Call it tech-savvy snitching for the opulence-sick and environmentally conscious. But this year #droughtshaming – the act of naming-and-shaming water-wasters on social media – has taken on a new, class-conscious, anti-corporate life of its own. Targets in the past few weeks have included Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, for maintaining obscenely green, lush lawns, visible from the air; Walmart, for sourcing its bottled water from the drought-stricken state at enormous profit; rich Beverly Hills residents, for filling up their pools; and even a local Ritz hotel that was “water misting” its too-rich-to-be-hot patrons.     Kim #Kardashian &amp; #KanyeWest really ought to get with the #water #conservation program. RT Get busy #droughtshaming https://t.co/VoIpaoymPg&mdash; OhMo (@OhMo) May 11, 2015    “When we are in crisis, everyone blames everyone else,” said Jon Christensen, an environmental historian at the University of California, Los Angeles. “People say: ‘I’m doing enough, but my neighbours aren’t.’”  In the past, passing the buck for water shortage has had northern California blaming southern California, cities blaming suburban development and water bottlers blaming agriculture.  “What is new is the class warfare that has now come into it,” Christensen said. “There is a lot of focus on the fact that the rich and famous use more water than others.” Drought shaming took off last summer and was initially state-sanctioned. California lawmakers passed a law in July to hand water-wasters fines of up to $500 a day. Offenders included anyone watering their lawns to the extent where the pavement became flooded, washing cars with nozzle-less hoses, and hosing down driveways and sidewalks. Furious Californians were only too happy to help. Eco-vigilantes told on neighbours through official means, helping local governments issue fines and warnings, but also patrolled streets and used social media to shame people into changing their ways. Many tweets and uploaded videos include street addresses. The stakes are higher this year. As California enters its fourth year of drought, and after its governor, Jerry Brown, called for the reduction of water usage in urban areas by 25% and fines of up to $10,000 for wasting water, attention has started to shift towards some of the most obscene versions of water wastage and offensive water profiteering. These point to another California ill: vast economic inequality.  In Los Angeles, one of the most unequal cities in America, while lawns in poorer parts of town have mostly gone brown – because residents do not want to risk fines, because they do not want to pay higher bills anyway, because they may have less immediate incentive to worry about property value – lawns in hyper-wealthy places like Beverly Hills, Bel Air and Pacific Palisades are still reportedly overwhelmingly green.  One Twitter user, Gail Becker, threatened Rancho Mirage’s Ritz-Carlton, a hotel where room prices start at $549 a night, with #droughshaming for its “constant misting”.     Dear @RitzCarlton #RanchoMirage,  love u but w constant misting,  please don&#39;t force us  into #droughtshaming...with @amykavanaugh @shoreen&mdash; gail becker (@gailfbecker) May 3, 2015    On Thursday, Southern California Public Radio aired an interview in which the Nestlé Waters North America chief executive, Tim Brown, said he would not be moving his company’s bottling operations out of California, as other companies have done. Rather he said, if he could increase it, he would.  “The class differences are very real,” Christensen said. “There are people in very poor neighbourhoods who do not use much water anyway and who cannot decrease their water much more.  “The correlation with wealthier people here is very simple: they have bigger yards.”    . Hey @LADWP I know a neighborhood in West LA that wastes water like a mofo. Come fine them. #droughtshaming&mdash; Amir Levi (@LunifiedMaggs) May 12, 2015    Newly implemented rules in California have tried to adapt to such socio-economic differences by imposing water reductions on a scale from -8% to -36%. Residents in areas already working to reduce water use in theory face lower demands than those in water-extravagant ones.  Christensen, however, warned about the limits of a culture of blame and shame, saying it was not conducive to providing creative solutions in resolving the problem of living harmoniously through the drought, and thinking about what California’s way of life will look like in the long term.",2015-05-16T12:00:02Z,California drought shaming takes on a class-conscious edge,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""f5fd657860337639e2562bccf0eef094cb96e1ea""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/f5fd657860337639e2562bccf0eef094cb96e1ea/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg"" alt=""Workers roll out artificial turf after digging up a lawn due to the drought, at a home in Laguna Niguel, California."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Workers roll out artificial turf after digging up a lawn due to the drought, at a home in Laguna Niguel, California.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Lucy Nicholson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>",41,"From Kim and Kanye’s verdant lawns to the Ritz-Carlton hotel’s water-misted patrons, social media users are targeting rich water wasters for public opprobrium",http://media.guim.co.uk/f5fd657860337639e2562bccf0eef094cb96e1ea/0_0_3500_2101/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/16/california-drought-shaming-takes-on-a-class-conscious-edge,0,positive
"Who is the most despicable aqua-villain in Los Angeles? For many years, the answer was Noah Cross, the name of the John Huston character in Chinatown, what with his iniquitous manipulation of the city’s water supply and that business about Faye Dunaway’s daughter also being her sister. But all things must pass, and a series of exciting new challengers to Mr Cross’s title have emerged. Yes, California’s raging drought has proved fertile ground for a new generation of ratbags: celebrities who are still watering their lawns despite high-level warnings about the devastating shortages. It seems the fines for such behaviour are a drop in the reservoir to all manner of stars and entertainment-industry bigwigs, who have treated the plea to switch to fake grass like an invitation to do community theatre in Arkansas. “Even somebody who’s got a mega-mansion,” sighs Julian Gold, the mayor of Beverly Hills, “with a huge lawn and tons of money, has to understand that, at the end of the day, if there’s no water coming out of the faucet, it’s their faucet also.” Has to understand it – but unfortunately has yet to understand it. Think of it as moronic irrigation, the latest celebrity science-craze you are gasping to be a part of. According to the New York Post, one LA water official has revealed a somewhat eye-catching statistic: that an estimated 70% of his district’s water is going to the lawn maintenance of about 100 manicured estates. Thus the drought-shaming has begun. Publications are running aerial photos of various celebrity properties, the emerald lawns in stark contrast to their parched surroundings. As one headline had it: “Let them eat dust.” Who’s in the frame? Well, the likes of Barbra Streisand, Kim Kardashian, Jennifer Lopez … I’m not going to get into a game of “what links?”. But if the euphemism which most frequently attaches itself to your personage is “strong-willed”, then chances are your lawn makes Augusta National Golf Club look like the Kalahari. Also, your neighbours adore you. “The Kardashian flowers and hedges are right in our face,” hisses one Hidden Hills resident to the Post. “It’s disgusting. You walk by and you can smell the freshness.” Smell that Kardashian freshness. Go on, SMELL IT. As for Barbra, it was only last week that her official website was drawing attention to water-conservancy issues, highlighting a report about the effects of drought on a Nevada lake feeding into the Hoover Dam. And a few weeks before that, madam was laughing pointedly along with a comedian who suggested Americans were finally being woken up to climate change because it was affecting their lawns. “The article is satire,” she explained to her devotees. As you may know, Barbra lives in the Beyond Satire district of Los Angeles. Accordingly, her publicist – the uncompromisingly named Ken Sunshine – has emerged to pour cold water on the idea that she is some kind of selfish diva. “She has cut down her water usage by over 50% in the last several months,” he declares, “and she is going to conserve further.” Mmm. Look, I don’t want to suggest that a commitment to desist from Barbra Streisand isn’t the gold standard. But the formbook suggests her sprinklers are on a permanent farewell tour, with each activation absolutely and honestly going to be their last. Let’s not take her commitment to the bank until Ken releases footage of Barbra walking across her scorched brown gardens, singing “You don’t bring me flowers any more” at the parched beds. Anyway, it must be said that amid all the verdant horror there are some extraordinarily moving stories of sacrifice. According to one report, Kurt Russell has planted the vines in his vineyard closer together so they need less watering. LL Cool J no longer runs the shower for five minutes before stepping into it. Sharon Osborne has made the announcement that “when I pee, I don’t flush”. (As far as her excrement goes, you may recall that she puts that in a Tiffany box and sends it to those who displease her.) And a Sky News report from Beverly Hills pointed out that “ordinary residents are having their dried lawns spray-painted ‘grass green’.” Which wins the award for Best Use of the Word Ordinary in a Californian Setting. Meanwhile, a certain Kim Kardashian recently announced that she was doing her bit by only washing her hair every five days. So maybe her thriving lawn is just a miracle – the feeding of the 15,000 sq ft using only one’s own saintliness and half a bucket of recycled hair-washing water. Who can say for sure? Like much of this noir-ish mystery, it has yet to be unravelled – though the mayor of Beverly Hills is promising to get to the bottom of it all. “I’m going to go knock on their door and tell them to stop,” he said this week. “I think it’s going to come down to neighbours policing neighbours.” That’s slightly disappointing. I was hoping it was going to come down to the mayor getting in way over his head with his investigation, and it all ending in a showdown in which he is held back from some Hollywood player’s doorstep by a well-meaning colleague shouting: “Forget it, Jake – it’s Robert Towne.” But if internecine conflict within the celebrity community is the authorities’ preferred approach, then we’ll just have to make our peace with that instead.",2015-05-14T17:34:46Z,Moronic irrigation: LA’s new turf war against its sprinkler-happy celebrities,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""34ecb7d4658c18b2a4929e6436b9a620f6b2dfc1""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431622753450/5aa345ee-64f7-4510-9b29-1ad5211429af-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Jennifer Lopez and Barbra Streisand"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Jennifer Lopez and Barbra Streisand and, in the background, the latter’s well-watered estate.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Splash News/Rex/Getty/Guardian montage</span> </figcaption> </figure>",42,Drought shaming may be the only way to take on Hollywood’s finest and their lush green lawns,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431622753802/5aa345ee-64f7-4510-9b29-1ad5211429af-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2015/may/14/moronic-irrigation-los-angeles-turf-war-against-sprinklerhappy-celebrities-drought,0,negative
"The boss of Nestlé Waters has said the company wants to increase the amount of water it bottles in California despite a devastating drought across the state that has triggered demonstrations at the corporation’s bottling plant. Tim Brown, chief executive of Nestlé Waters North America, said the company would “absolutely not” stop bottling in California and would actually like to “increase” the amount of ground source water it uses. Asked in a local radio interview if Nestlé would consider following Starbucks’ lead and stop bottling water in California during the drought, Brown said: “Absolutely not. In fact, if I could increase it, I would. “The fact is, if I stop bottling water tomorrow, people would buy another brand of bottled water,” Brown said in a discussion with a Nasa hydrologist on 89.3 KPCC radio. “People need to hydrate. As the second largest bottler in the state, we’re filling a role many others are filling. It’s driven by consumer demand, it’s driven by an on-the-go society that needs to hydrate. Frankly, we’re very happy they are doing it in a healthier way.” Brown admitted that Nestlé currently wastes about 30% of the 700m gallons of water a year it draws from the ground in California. On Tuesday, the company announced plans to reduce water waste at its bottling plants in Bakersfield and Tulare by 12%. More than 82,000 people have signed a petition calling on Nestlé to stop bottling from a spring in southern California, and protesters armed with plastic pitchforks have blocked the entrance to a Nestlé plant in Sacramento. Despite the protests, Brown said: “We feel good about what we’re doing delivering healthy hydrating to people throughout the state of California.” Starbucks has announced plans to stop sourcing its bottled water from California after embarrassing revelations that its “water conservation” Ethos brand bottled water was sourced from the drought-stricken state. “It seems hard to imagine, but more than 1bn people on our planet can’t get clean water to drink,” Starbucks says on its website. “Ethos® Water was created to help raise awareness about this terrible crisis and provide children with access to clean water.” Five cents from the sale of each Ethos bottle, which costs about $2, goes towards Starbucks’ Ethos Water Fund supporting water, sanitation and hygiene education programs across the world. The company said it would move Ethos production to Pennsylvania for the duration of the drought. “We are committed to our mission to be a globally responsible company and to support the people of the state of California as they face this unprecedented drought,” John Kelly, Starbucks’ senior vice-president of global responsibility and public policy, said last week.  Walmart, which also bottles water in California, has refused to move its production out of the state. “The drought in California is very concerning for many of our customers and our associates,” a spokesman said. “We share those concerns and are tracking it closely. Our commitment to sustainability includes efforts to minimize water use in our facilities. We have and continue to work with our suppliers to act responsibly while meeting the needs of customers who count on us across California.” Sustainability charity Food &amp; Water Watch has called for a moratorium on all water bottling across the state. “It’s the worst drought we’ve seen in a long time, and it’s irresponsible of the state to allow Nestlé to bottle water that’s supposed to be a public resource,” a spokesman said. “We’re calling for a moratorium on bottling water for private profit.”",2015-05-14T16:17:54Z,Nestlé boss says he wants to bottle more water in California despite drought,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""f6d4d854323eb98c199ca4389fdba5ea1ff534f8""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/f6d4d854323eb98c199ca4389fdba5ea1ff534f8/0_65_3000_1801/1000.jpg"" alt=""Water flows from a pipe connected to a spring on Frazier Mountain in Los Padres National Forest near Frazier Park, California.

"Half of leading bottled-water brands source their product from drought-stricken California, a fact that has media and consumer groups up in arms. It doesn’t help matters that the process by which companies gain access to public water sources in California is fairly opaque, or that the state keeps no record of how much groundwater the “spring water” bottlers – Arrowhead (owned by Nestle), Ethos (owned by Starbucks), Refreshe (Safeway) and Crystal Geyser – use. To make matters worse, new groundwater management regulations won’t change that until 2020. The news that many bottlers operating in California’s national forests are doing so with long-expired permits has only added fuel to the fire. An investigation by the Desert Sun newspaper in Palm Springs, California, revealed earlier this month that Nestle has been piping water out of Southern California’s San Bernardino National Forest under a permit that expired in 1988. The paper found that Nestle’s was one of dozens of similarly expired permits. In response, Tim Brown, chairman, president and CEO of Nestle Waters North America, responded with an opinion piece in the San Bernardino Sun defending his company’s practices and noting that, under federal law, Nestle’s national forest permit is valid until deemed otherwise.    No agency is currently tracking what’s available in groundwater aquifers, or how much is being pumped out of them.    Brown also equated Nestle’s use of California water – 705m gallons a year, bottled at five plants across the state – to the average annual watering needs of two California golf courses. For water rights advocates, though, there are broader implications. “It highlights a bigger policy problem: the state doesn’t track groundwater,” said Adam Scow, of water rights nonprofit Food and Water Watch. Scow added that pumping groundwater has a bigger impact in some parts of the state than others, an impact that is inadequately measured by simply comparing the number of gallons used for bottled water to the number of gallons used for other purposes in the state.  “If Nestle continues to pump in Southern California at high rates, during a drought, when it’s not being recharged, it will be over-drafting that groundwater source,” Scow said. “And that’s a big problem when you’ve got wells going dry and people in the state without access to clean drinking water.” Piping without permits The problems with granting private access to public water go beyond Nestle’s national forest permit, according to Peter Gleick, executive director of nonprofit water research organization Pacific Institute. “If society is going to bother regulating and protecting public water and public lands by issuing permits limiting and managing water use, they should do it right,” said Gleick, who authored a book about the problem with Americans’ fondness for bottled water. “Paper permits are worthless when it comes to protecting the public interest.” San Bernardino National Forest Supervisor Jody Noiron has said that reviewing Nestle’s permit – as well as other water permits in the forest – is now a top priority.     The plant that bottles water for Safeway and Ethos draws from two areas described as being in “exceptional drought”.    Sounding every bit the overloaded and underfunded government employee, Noiron told various media outlets that she had not realized the permit had expired so long ago, and that the issue would now move to the top of the pile. She has also said that various environmental laws were not yet on the books in the 1970s, when Arrowhead first applied for the permit that Nestle now holds. The permit will now need to be updated with respect to those laws, which could take anywhere from 18 months to more than two years, she added. Even if the review is updated to comply with current laws, though, it might still fail to address the concerns of water rights activists. “We have to ask the bigger question: is this a reasonable and beneficial use of public water?” Scow said. “Of course it’s not.” No one knows what’s in the well There’s also the issue of water use transparency, which is murky at best. Local permitting agencies tend to look only at the immediate environmental impact of a groundwater pipeline or bottling facility, while the state water board monitors only the quality of bottled water.  No agencies currently track what’s available in groundwater aquifers, or how much is being pumped out of them. A prime example of the fallout is the Safeway-Lucerne bottling plant in Merced, California. The plant bottles water both for Safeway stores and for Starbucks’ Ethos water – the sales of which, ironically, generates donations for international water charities.  Using groundwater from the Merced area for Safeway and groundwater from a private spring at the foot of the Sierra Nevadas for Ethos, the plant draws from two areas described by the US National Drought Mitigation Center as being in “exceptional drought”. But no information is publicly available as to how much groundwater is being used or how much is available in the aquifers. In fact, due to the state’s historic mismanagement of groundwater, those details may not be known.  Scow said he hopes the current attention around what he called “the most egregious misuses of public water” – bottled water, fracking, and corporate agriculture growing water-hungry crops in the driest parts of the state – will encourage California Governor Jerry Brown to take a more aggressive position.  “The state has all the power it needs to manage groundwater right now,” Scow said. “I don’t expect Nestle to voluntarily stop making money bottling water. That’s why we have government. We just need them to step up and govern.” Unnecessary luxury in a drought Bottlers have also argued that while Americans consume about 10bn gallons of bottled water a year, California alone uses 38bn gallons a day.  Still, there are significant energy and material wastes inherent in the product. Only 38% of plastic bottles are recycled, and it takes about 1.6 liters of water to package and transport every liter, not to mention the energy costs. In a drought situation, Gleick said, every use of water needs to be re-examined. “The drought raises awareness of all water issues and offers an opportunity to look more carefully at every water-using sector of our economy, including bottled water,” he said. “Ultimately, in the US and most developed nations, bottled water is a luxury, not a necessity. When drought forces us to look at all water uses, the first things to challenge are unnecessary luxuries.”",2015-04-30T20:19:58Z,Why are we drinking bottled water from the driest parts of California?,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""42bca190ac3f7a62b10bd497061a32fbc4548ca6""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/30/1430425793481/40312faa-a1d8-46eb-98b4-f8584016657f-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Water lines are visible along the steep banks of Lake McClure on March 24, 2015 in La Grange, California.

"Walmart is the latest company found to be sourcing its bottled water from drought-stricken California, as state residents push for greater regulation of the bottling industry. Starbucks was moved to alter its bottling practices in California last week and Mount Shasta community members are fighting the opening of a major bottling plant by California-based company Crystal Geyser. Then on Friday, an investigation by CBS13 in Sacramento found that Walmart’s bottled water comes from the Sacramento municipal water supply.  The revelations come as state residents face increased water use limits during the fourth year of drought in the state. State governor Jerry Brown signed an executive order last week that calls for a 25% urban water reduction across the state.  “It’s only logical that as the governor has asked all Californians to reduce their water consumption that he holds extractive industries like bottled water companies to the same standard, yet he hasn’t asked anything of them,” said Adam Scow, the California director of Food &amp; Water Watch, which is calling for a moratorium on bottling water.  There is little oversight or monitoring of bottling plants in the state, which are also operated by major corporations including Nestle, Coca-Cola and Pepsi.  About 1% of state water is used in industry, and the bottling industry represents an even smaller fraction of that, according to the US Geological Survey. Walmart, like other large companies, draws water from municipal supplies to keep costs down. A Walmart spokesperson said that the company is “very concerned” about how the drought is affecting its customers and associates.  “We share those concerns and are tracking it closely,” the spokesperson said. “Our commitment to sustainability includes efforts to minimize water use in our facilities. We have and continue to work with our suppliers to act responsibly while meeting the needs of customers who count on us across California.” Starbucks was pushed to stop sourcing its Ethos bottled water from California after Mother Jones  discovered that it had been drawing water from Placer County. Starbucks said it would move production to a supplier in Pennsylvania over the next six months. It is also looking for alternative suppliers for its west coast distribution.  “At the end of the day, bottling the public’s water for private profit is not in the public interest,” said Scow.  He said the practice has a negative effect on local watersheds, that the oil and energy used to make plastic bottles and transport them across the nation are harmful to the environment and that there is a huge waste problem with plastic bottle disposal.  Crystal Geyser, a bottled water company headquartered in San Francisco, announced it is opening a new plant near Mount Shasta, which feeds water into the Sacramento River. The company does not need to obtain a permit to draw the water and there is not a requirement to conduct an environmental impact report. Raven Stevens, community liaison for the Gateway Neighborhood Association, told the San Francisco Chronicle that the top concern is that there is little regulation for bottling plants.  “Crystal Geyser in one day plans to pump more water than any three of my neighbors will use in an entire year,” Stevens said. “The entire state is under a 25% cut, farmers are letting fields go fallow and we don’t have one piece of legislation regulating water bottling.”",2015-05-11T17:19:45Z,Walmart found to be sourcing bottled water from drought-stricken California,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""8e23bb907696b1faa9c5e42f720f2c4dec87c6bb""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/8e23bb907696b1faa9c5e42f720f2c4dec87c6bb/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg"" alt=""California water"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A dry boat dock sits next to a water bottle lying on Huntington Lake bed after the water receded, in the High Sierra, California.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Lucy Nicholson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>",45,Residents who have faced increased water use limits amid fourth year of drought push for greater regulation of water-bottling industry,http://media.guim.co.uk/8e23bb907696b1faa9c5e42f720f2c4dec87c6bb/0_0_3500_2101/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/11/walmart-sourcing-bottled-water-california-drought,4,negative
"The Abbott government has earmarked $83m in new spending to assist drought-affected communities, including money for local infrastructure projects and pest control programs. The government was due to announce a $333m drought assistance package on Saturday, a figure that includes $250m to continue access to existing drought-specific concessional loans. The loan funding is rolled over from previous allocations. The new funding includes $35m for shovel-ready infrastructure and employment projects, which aim to stimulate spending at a time when local economies are facing significant difficulties. A further $26m to manage pest animals and weeds in drought-affected areas would “provide work for rural contractors while assisting landowners to deal with the impact of feral animals on livestock and pasture”, the government said in a statement. Other spending will be directed to help community wellbeing, with $20m to improve access to mental health support and counselling services and $1.8m for additional rural financial counsellors in drought-hit areas. Tony Abbott said the assistance was “an acknowledgment of the difficulties being experienced by farmers and by the communities they help to sustain”. “It is critical these communities remain viable and that people stay in jobs so that they can take advantage of better conditions when the drought breaks,” the prime minister said. Abbott foreshadowed the funding in a joint statement with the deputy prime minister, Warren Truss, and the agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce. They said helping farmers through times of drought was in the national interest. “Despite unprecedented drought conditions in some parts of the country and a third failed wet season in large parts of the north, Australia’s agriculture sector will contribute an estimated $52bn to the economy this financial year,” they said. The package includes $250m in the 2015-16 financial year to extend access to existing drought-specific concessional loans schemes which were due to expire. The government said it had approved $270m in concessional loans to 531 farm businesses over the past two years – although it has previously faced some criticism over tight eligibility criteria. It is understood the $270m in loans approved over the past two years comes from a total pool of $700m earmarked for three streams of loans, which include not only the drought concessional loans but also drought recovery and farm finance loans. Labor’s agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, issued a statement on Friday anticipating the latest drought package announcement. “It is now clear the announcements of drought assistance which followed the prime minister’s well-publicised drought tour in February 2014 have been a failure, and this weekend, he is about to concede as much,” Fitzgibbon said. “The promised $280m concessional loans sounded big, but little of it has been spent because too many farmers just don’t qualify or have simply concluded they are a waste of time, particularly as interest rates continue to fall.”",2015-05-08T15:10:52Z,Abbott government hands extra $83m for drought-affected regions,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""a605fcdd3209e0db12482e9cc6e8d2ab85cf0c9e""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/a605fcdd3209e0db12482e9cc6e8d2ab85cf0c9e/0_11_4636_2783/1000.jpg"" alt=""Rains have failed for three years running in some parts of northern Australia, the government said."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Rains have failed for three years running in some parts of northern Australia, the government said.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Dan Peled/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>",46,"Government earmarks cash for infrastructure projects, pest control programs and ‘community well-being’",http://media.guim.co.uk/a605fcdd3209e0db12482e9cc6e8d2ab85cf0c9e/0_11_4636_2783/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/may/08/abbott-government-hands-extra-83m-for-drought-affected-regions,2,negative
"Global food prices, which have been rising since 2012, may be ready for another hike.  In a report released Thursday, Ceres, a sustainable business consortium based in Boston, found that most food companies aren’t prepared to deal with the water risks that it expects will lead to higher water and food prices.  “We are coming to an end of cheap, plentiful water. Most of the food companies assume that water will remain cheap, and for investors that assumption is dangerous in terms of the companies’ long term profitability,” said Brooke Barton, the report’s co-author and director of the Ceres water program. “We feel that most companies are not addressing these risks adequately.” Water is a major ingredient in food, from bacon to pizza: growing crops and raising animals account for about 70% of the world’s water use, according to the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization. It takes 15,415 liters of water to produce a kilogram of beef, according to the Water Footprint Network, a Netherlands nonprofit that consults on water management and policy. A kilogram of pasta requires 1,850 liters of water. Moreover, one third of the food production takes place where water is becoming scarce, according to the World Resources Institute, a Washington DC research group that studies water, food and energy. Better water management plans by governments and businesses are needed, according to the Ceres report, which ranked 37 companies on their water management.  Scores were based on how the companies track water use and implement conservation plans – and whether their efforts include only their own operations or also their suppliers – as well as what companies are doing to reduce water pollution from fertilizer runoffs and other farming and production processes. Most of the companies scored poorly. On a scale of zero to 100, 31 companies ranked lower than 50.     The Ceres report ranked 37 companies on their water management. Photograph: Ceres    Kraft Foods Group, the maker of Cool Whip and Oscar Mayer sandwich meat, scored a mere six points. Tyson Foods, the company behind Jimmy Dean sausage and Sara Lee desserts, got eight. Constellation Brands, supplier of many happy hour staples such as Corona beer and Svedka vodka – and wine producers including Robert Mondavi Winery and Ravenswood – received 24.  The bottom three scorers were Monster Beverage with one point, Pinnacle Foods with one point and Pilgrim’s Pride with three points. Meanwhile, Unilever scored the highest at 70, followed by 67 for Coca-Cola, 64 for Nestle and 57 for General Mills. Ceres used publicly available data, such as corporate financial and sustainability reports, to make its assessments. Four of its member companies are ranked in the report: General Mills, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola and Brown Forman.  Where companies fall short In many cases, companies included in the report aren’t tracking water use beyond their own operations, or aren’t tracking it well, according to Ceres. That’s a problem given that some of the top water uses come from their supply chains. Most companies also don’t have incentives in place – either internally or for their processors or farmers – for improving water conservation or reducing water pollution, the report said.  Kellogg’s chief sustainability officer, Diane Holdorf, praised the Ceres report for raising awareness about the challenges companies face and giving examples of practices worth emulating.  Kellogg, which scored 54, plans to do better, Holdorf said. The company’s 2014 sustainability report, issued last month, set new goals for 2020. The company is on track to meet its 2015 goal of reducing the amount of water it uses per metric ton of food produced by 15%-20% from 2005 levels.  The 2020 goals include working with farmers to use water and fertilizers more efficiently and protect their watersheds. In February, Kellogg announced several water conservation projects, including one slated to receive $10m in federal funding, on rice farms in Louisiana and wheat farms in Michigan. “Water is an important issue for us and for the food and beverage sector,” Holdorf said. “I think all of us have plenty of work to do.”    Related: US water parks stricken by drought attempt to conserve a dwindling resource    Packaged food and drink Drink and snack makers scored the best for their water risk management plans: they tend to have more recognizable brands and are under more pressure from their customers to be good environmental stewards, according to Ceres.  Some have already seen cuts in their sales and expansion plans because of dwindling or polluting water supplies, Barton noted.  Drought punctuated by a short period of intense rain in California contributed to a 28% profit decline in a carrot farming division of Campbell Soup Company during the last quarter of 2014. Last month, Coca-Cola abandoned a project to build a bottling plant in India after a battle from the local community over worries about depleting groundwater supplies.  Overall, packaged food and beverage companies fared better than meat and agricultural product companies such as Chiquita Brands, Archer Daniels Midland and Fresh Del Monte.  Meat and grains Jackie Anderson, an ADM spokeswoman, declined to comment on the Ceres assessment, which gives the company a score of 10. Most of the company’s processing plants that use high volumes of water are in regions where local water resources are not stressed, she said in an email, adding that ADM surpassed its goal of cutting water use 15% between 2008 and 2018 early, by the end of 2014. Meat producers face some of the highest water risk because meat production requires so much water. Among the six meat companies included in the report, Smithfield Foods received the highest score – and that’s a paltry 33.  Kathleen Kirkham, a spokeswoman for Smithfield, which makes bacon and sausages, emailed to say the company has already exceeded its 2015 goal of reducing water use by 10%, from 2008 levels, per 100 pounds of product produced, and plans to set new goals.    Related: World Water Day: the cost of cotton in water-challenged India     Tyson spokesman Dan Fogleman wrote that the report didn’t take into account some of the new technologies the company been using to conserve and reuse water, leading a 14.7% cut in the gallons of water used per pound of finished product “over the past several years”. He said the report also “mischaracterized” the company’s North American wastewater discharge as pollution. “The water we release back into the environment has been though a government-permitted treatment process,” he said.  Barton said she did consider the water saving technologies in her assessment, but Tyson lost points for not having a publicly stated water reduction goal. Ceres’s evaluation – which didn’t address the regulatory compliance of wastewater discharge – was based on the most recent public data reported to the US Environmental Protection Agency, according to which Tyson was responsible for the largest wastewater discharge in the US, she said. “Those discharges are permitted, but are still labeled by the US government as a form of pollution,” Barton said.  Some of the companies declined to comment on the report – such as Hormel Foods and Constellation Brands – or didn’t respond to requests for comments by press time, such as Dr Pepper Snapple Group.  Best practices and next steps Ceres also highlighted examples of strong water management policies. For example, Campbell Soup, Dean Foods, Molson Coors and Unilever offer executives financial incentives for achieving water management goals.  Coca-Cola, General Mills, Kellogg, Nestle and Unilever have deadline-driven goals to expand sustainable water management practices, which range from planting cover crops to reduce water runoffs and soil erosion to capturing and storing rainfall, across the majority of their suppliers.   Related: $8bn habitat conservation plan scrapped as California prioritises agribusiness    The report also recommends several things the industry can do to improve.  While some companies require reporting from their suppliers, it’s not clear how they use the data to make better purchasing decisions or to help their suppliers improve. Creating new standards for reporting and data collection could help reduce the amount of time farmers and other suppliers need to spend filling out surveys – and could lead to industry-wide solutions.  Ceres recommends that companies work more closely with their suppliers, including farmers, to collect good data, secure water supplies and conserve more. Businesses should also support watershed protection and report water risks regularly to their board of directors and shareholders, the group claims.  Meanwhile, investors who want to include water risks in their financial analyses should demand more comprehensive water use reporting from their portfolio companies and make investment decisions accordingly, Ceres suggests. According to the report, they should consider three key factors: how much water is needed, how secure the water supply is, and how the management deal with water scarcity, pollution and other related risks.  “Right now, a lot of what we are producing is linked to the fact that water is free,” Barton said. “We will see a shift.” The water hub is funded by Grundfos.

"Water has its own language in this town. Residents talk about nervous neighbors “pulling the hose”, or speculate about which houses on a street are “on the line”. People gripe about how neighbors use “tank water” to hydrate plants.  That water lingo developed in this rural city of 6,700 – mostly poor Latino farm workers – should not be surprising. There has been a preoccupation with the stuff that comes from the tap since residents started running out of it. East Porterville is the epicenter of individual suffering in drought-stricken California. Nearly 1,000 private wells that once delivered water to homes and small businesses inside Tulare County have dried up, leaving desperate residents with just a few costly options, and no water. In all of California, there are 800 more such wells. Now, as the well failures expand and without much water infrastructure to speak of, the people of East Porterville are expecting a long, hot summer without precipitation. Waterless residents are struggling to shower, cook and clean. And more permanent solutions, such as drilling a new well, come with no small amount of expense, frustration and worry.     The Tule River in Porterville is dry except for a few pools of water. Photograph: Scott Smith/AP    State and county officials, along with a patchwork of volunteers, have taken up emergency measures, delivering bottles and installing tanks. But with few solutions, the intensifying drought is likely to only worsen the water nightmare here. East Porterville’s unofficial water maven, Donna Johnson, encountered her first dry well last spring – her own. Though water would sometimes dribble out of her faucet through the hot summer months, she didn’t accept that her well could fail until weeks after it actually did. Almost a month had passed when her husband, Howard, attempted to extend the well by 10ft. As he lowered an electric pump into the hole that once supplied their home with water, there was an audible “clunk” when their should have been a splash. So Johnson started asking around: Do you have water? “I thought it might have been 15, 20 wells” that went dry, said Johnson. But as she went door to door asking, the list of people who had no water – to drink, cook, clean or bathe – only grew. When it reached 100, she called local authorities. “Had she not done that, I don’t know that we would have had any sense of the severity of it,” said Andrew Lockman, Tulare County’s emergency manager. Johnson didn’t stop at 100. She kept knocking on doors, asking folks if their well had gone dry. The answer, over and over again, was yes. She delivered bottled water, buying it with her own money, earning her the nickname “water angel”. Since the county started tracking private well failures in September, 996 have been reported, the vast majority in East Porterville. County officials have approved more than 2,600 well-drilling permits; 654 households have bottled drinking water hand-delivered; and the United Way of Tulare County has received 683 drought-related calls for assistance. The water angel’s efforts have caused spats with her husband. She receives late-night phone calls from hysterical mothers without water. Friends and neighbors – even her well contractor – have spit frustration her way, for lack of anywhere else to turn. “Nobody had a concept of what it was like to live without water,” Johnson told the Guardian. Fewer still know when it’s going to come back. Emergency measures, from the pastor to the governor     Pastor Frankie Olmedo, left, who volunteers four hours a day to hand out water, fills up a container for Luis Bocanegra in Porterville. Photograph: Lucy Nicholson/Reuters    About 80 homes in East Porterville now have small, clear boxes sitting out front. The square plastic tanks hold around 350 gallons of non-potable water. It’s enough to run toilets and take showers, but nothing with which to wash dishes or cook. The county has installed 53 large potable water tanks, which hold up to 2,500 gallons of water at homes around Tulare. Thirty-one such tanks sit in East Porterville. More water comes in bottles, distributed from churches, the county and Johnson herself. And there remains hope that the end of April could bring a storm. More people still have improvised solutions of their own. Some have hooked a neighbor’s garden hose to their house, cautiously sipping from a neighbor’s well. (When a well-owner takes the water back, that’s called “pulling the hose”.) Others haul water home in giant barrels or gray plastic garbage cans from a large tank at the town’s fire station.   Related: California drought spurs protest over 'unconscionable' bottled water business    At Iglesia Emanuel, where a trailer with 16 emergency showers sits in the parking lot, a steady stream of cars pass through the lot looking for bottled water. Security guard Daisy Martinez directs the drivers to the pastor’s remaining bottles. “Every day there’s always people asking for water,” said Martinez, a new mother who lives in Porterville on the municipal water system. “He runs out very quickly.” Pastor Ramon Hernandez gave away his final box on Wednesday morning. He didn’t expect more until the following week. Of course, East Porterville isn’t the only town experiencing extreme drought in California. Nearly the entire state is at least “abnormally dry” (0.14% is not). Almost half the state (44%) is in “exceptional” drought, the most severe condition, according to the US Drought Monitor. That prompted Governor Jerry Brown to declare mandatory restrictions on urban water use, ordering a 25% cutback. The measures, however necessary, have been criticized for not requiring enough of agriculture, which accounts for 80% of human water use in the state. Still, some researchers believe much of California’s water use remains obscured by a complex regulatory system built around the state’s most precious resource. California’s water rights system regulates surface water but not groundwater, making it difficult to track which users slurp up the most water, despite acknowledgements from the state water board that the two resources are interdependent. Two scientists at the University of California found that the state’s surface water alone is over-allocated by a factor of five, and that it’s unclear how much water California actually uses. “Without improvements to the water rights system,” they wrote last summer, “growing human and environmental demands portend an intensification of regional water scarcity and social conflict.” Surface water is allocated by water rights in California. Groundwater, by comparison, is largely free for the taking, unregulated by the state board. In an effort to mitigate the regulatory gulf between surface water and groundwater, California’s legislature passed a law to require sustainability plans from local water agencies. However, the law won’t be in full effect until 2040. Meanwhile, the San Joaquin Valley is one of the heaviest groundwater users in the state, and authorities have known for some time that many small California towns lean heavily on groundwater supplies. A 2003 Department of Water Resources report expressed this in the plainest of terms: “Many small- to moderate-sized towns and cities are entirely dependent on groundwater for drinking water supplies.” Up to 50% of Californians use groundwater for at least part of their water supply, but there is little data or management of the resource, the report said. Groundwater generally supplies most domestic uses in Tulare County, according to Lockman, the county’s emergency manager. Both East Porterville and its sister city Porterville are dependent on such groundwater. The key difference between the two cities is that Porterville has water, and East Porterville does not. ‘The poor get poorer’, from Porterville to East Porterville       Porterville was developed with a municipal water system hooked to a deep, industrial-grade well. Residents of Porterville depend on groundwater as much as their neighbors to the east, but because the larger city has infrastructure to pump from a deep aquifer, taps in Porterville haven’t gone dry. The lack of public infrastructure in East Porterville is part of what makes the “disaster” so difficult to mitigate: to get federal cash, a disaster must impact public infrastructure. In East Porterville, it’s largely impoverished farm workers bearing the brunt of the drought. “This is a kind of the-poor-get-poorer situation,” said Lockman. “It really is just like after a hurricane, and you still have a roof over your head but you can’t flush the toilet, you don’t have water.” Anecdotally, many residents of East Porterville work at citrus packing plants or pick oranges or grapes, according to locals. The per capita income is $11,046. Parishioners at Hernandez’s church, for example, are almost all farm workers, he said. Of the 1,700 residences in East Porterville, 69.3% don’t speak English at home, according to the US Census Bureau. Without infrastructure, homeowners of East Porterville have to find water by their own means. Usually, that means drilling a new well, at a cost of $10,000 to $30,000, according to Lockman. Payment options are limited. There are some grant programs available, but most cover only a third of the cost of drilling. Low-interest loans are available, but the exorbitant cost of drilling can make payments hundreds of dollars per month. The county’s ability to help is also limited by cash. Installing a municipal water system in East Porterville would likely take the better part of a decade and cost up to $60m, Lockman said. And that cost only includes pipes.  Connecting to Porterville’s water is also tenuous. Some houses are simply out of the system’s reach, miles from the nearest connections; for others constructing a connection is too expensive. The divide between Porterville and East Porterville, and even between neighbors with city water or dry wells, has created an aura of anxiety. There’s sniping between those trying to help, and bickering between neighbors. The topic of water can be delicate even between family members. Dalia Madrigal is a cashier at Hari’s Market, a Valero gas station and convenience store on one of East Porterville’s main thoroughfares. Her house, which she rents with four other people including a two-year-old, hasn’t had water since July. Her neighbor loaned the house a garden hose to provide running water, but she and her housemates are cautious about using it before 10pm. “My brother lives over on the west side, and people are watering their plants over there,” Madrigal said. “It’s not like you’re going to go, ‘Hey, we’re in a drought, could you please turn off your water?’” Judgment swirls around the relatively few people with lush green yards, and there are tales of neighbors calling the police on one another for watering plants with tank water. Johnson called the cemetery and golf course in town “irritating”. At Angelica Nungaray’s house, an elementary school cafeteria worker in East Porterville, there is no car-washing and no lawn-watering. She, her husband and her son take “two-minute” showers. And she fears seeing sand come from the tap, a sign that a pump is delivering the last water reserves of an empty well. “I’m scared because sometimes my pressure goes really low,” said Nungaray. She said she was especially nervous when her neighbors’ well pump had a mechanical problem. She feared that their well had gone dry. “When your neighbor starts having problems, you’re going to have problems.” While most people seem to take the shortage in good humor, the stress is evident.     Is there water at the end of the rainbow – or just more suffering? Photograph: Donna Johnson    At his auto repair shop, Edy Rodriguez knocks the rear disc brake of a late-model Chevrolet Malibu into place, while trying to explain to Johnson why his family of seven has no water. When Rodriguez attempted to navigate a web of bureaucracy to get his $30 water tank filled, “They told my wife, not for right now,” he said. Rodriguez’s family uses a hose from his neighbor’s house, an informal agreement that costs Rodriguez $50 per month. His business is also without water. California’s drought is only expected to intensify through the summer, according to the Climate Prediction Center, making a full recharge of East Porterville’s wells unlikely. Tulare County, identified by the state as a high priority for installing groundwater management, is overdrafting its supply by around 65m gallons per year. In the meantime, Lockman said, the county is attempting to provide “first-world type of things”. The only surefire way to mitigate the public health hazard “is to go out and red-tag the homes”, said Lockman, using government jargon for condemning the properties. “We take over a stadium and now you’re running a shelter, and you’ve displaced people from their support systems and their lives. “Realistically, I don’t think it’s beyond the point of failure to have double the number of wells go dry,” he said. “There’s so many straws in the glass that sooner or later it’s going empty.” • This article was amended on 23 April 2015.

"  Related: California drought water-use rules could force 36% reduction on Beverly Hills    Californians facing the prospect of endless drought, mandated cuts in water use and the browning of their summer lawns are mounting a revolt against the bottled water industry, following revelations that Nestlé and other big companies are taking advantage of poor government oversight to deplete mountain streams and watersheds at vast profit.  An online petition urging an immediate end to Nestle’s water bottling operations in the state has gathered more than 150,000 signatures, in the wake of an investigation by the San Bernardino Desert Sun that showed the company is taking water from some of California’s driest areas on permits that expired as long as 27 years ago.  Last month a protest at a Nestlé Waters North America bottling plant in Sacramento, the state capital, forced a one-day closure as protesters brandishing symbolic plastic torches and pitchforks blocked the entrances. The revelations have agencies from the California State Water Resources Control Board to the US Forest Service scrambling to justify a regulatory framework that is poorly policed and imposes almost no requirements on the big water companies to declare how much water they are taking.  Nestlé itself insists its water use is efficient and has minimal impact on the environment – something the activists reject out of hand. “While California is facing record drought conditions, it is unconscionable that Nestlé would continue to bottle the state’s precious water, export it and sell it for profit,” says the petition, which is sponsored by the political activist organisation the Courage Campaign. While city-dwellers and tourists might not think twice before knocking back an Arrowhead – Nestlé’s premier California still water brand – or a Crystal Geyser, residents near the affected springs and watersheds tend to be more vocal, because every drop Nestlé takes is one drop less for their own use and for the local flora and fauna.  “Nestlé has repeatedly ignored requests from local residents to halt its operations,” said Erin Diaz of the nonprofit Corporate Accountability International, which is running a “Think Outside the Bottle” campaign. “It’s clear that Nestlé has no intention of voluntarily halting its dangerous water bottling practices. It’s time for state water regulators to step in.” Nestlé and its competitors point out that bottled water accounts for a tiny fraction of California’s overall use, particularly when compared with the state’s vast agricultural infrastructure. Almond farming alone sucks down 10% of the state’s water, at a rate of roughly one gallon per almond.  In an online op-ed piece addressing the company’s relation to the drought, Nestlé Waters North America president and chief executive Tim Brown wrote: “We have made investments in all five of our facilities in California to further reduce the amount of water used for bottling and non-bottling processes.  “In 2014, we invested in conservation measures, which are projected to save at least 1.4 million gallons of water in California each year.”   Related: Is it fair to blame almond farmers for California’s drought?    But water-bottling also carries symbolic weight because it takes a natural resource that theoretically belongs to all and turns it into a product retailing for many thousands – some studies suggest hundreds of thousands – of times what it costs at source.  Studies over the past decade and a half have challenged the claims of an industry that barely existed 25 years ago that bottled water is healthier than tap – in fact somewhere between one quarter and one half of bottled water comes from the tap – and decried the environmental impact of the plastic bottles it usually comes in. “Pure drink or pure hype?” the National Resources Defense Council asked in 1999, and the question has never gone away. Until now, however, such objections have had little impact on the growth of the industry, whose sales topped 10bn gallons in the US for the first time in 2013 – 32 gallons per person – and are projected to be as high as 13bn gallons in 2014.  The US is now the world’s second-biggest consumer of bottled water, behind China. Nestlé and the other water giants, Coca-Cola and Pepsi, have often cut deals with relatively isolated, impoverished rural communities whereby they take a percentage of the local water supply, paying enough to keep municipal rates low for local residents. Government oversight often falls between the cracks of state agencies, the US Forest Service and autonomous Indian tribes, giving the companies greater leeway. The Desert Sun investigation found that a Nestlé pumping operation at Strawberry Creek in the San Bernardino National Forest, 60 miles east of Los Angeles, had been unlicensed since 1987. Another operation in the same National Forest, at Deer Canyon Springs, involves a deal between Nestlé and the local water district that has not been permitted since 1994.  The US Forest Service, which has undergone multiple budget cuts over past decades and has been under attack for its handling of fire prevention and restoration in the parched American West as well as water management, now says that dealing with the expired permits and considering whether to renew them is now a “top priority”.  One key question will be how much water Nestlé is taking to create what one industry group delightfully calls “the quintessential hydrating beverage”. The company claims 700m gallons a year, or about what it takes to keep two golf courses green. That might more easily be verified if legislation to force regular disclosure of volumes bottled and sold had not been vetoed by former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2008 and 2010.  Another regulatory headache, according to the activist group Food and Water Watch, is the near-absence of legislation governing groundwater – an absence largely explained by the lobbying power of agribusiness in a state that boasts the single most productive concentration of farm land on the planet.    Related: California water restrictions have not stopped the sprinklers from flowing    Governor Jerry Brown, who has come under fire for imposing a 25% reduction in water use on cities and municipalities but not on farms, signed a relatively toothless law last year that gave the state no power to assign rights to groundwater use.  According to Adam Scow, California director of Food and Water Watch, the governor and state agencies could in theory disregard the legislature and act on the California constitution which bars “waste or unreasonable use” of the state’s water supply.  “We need to start managing and protecting groundwater as a public resource,” Scow said. “In a drought, bottling public water for private profit qualifies as wasteful and unreasonable.”",2015-04-19T15:25:36Z,California drought spurs protest over 'unconscionable' bottled water business,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""68f48f78484bb61f7875840cb2e2c3129b247952""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/19/1429455040126/0c30dfdd-8ab2-4cd2-bab7-3c79f0f346e4-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""bottled water"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Bottled water is facing growing controversy amid California’s drought.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>",49,"Report reveals lax oversight as petition against Nestlé bottling operations garners 150,000 signatures<br>",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/19/1429455040444/0c30dfdd-8ab2-4cd2-bab7-3c79f0f346e4-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/19/california-drought-protest-bottled-water,4,neutral
"  Related: California water restrictions have not stopped the sprinklers from flowing    Billionaire-studded Beverly Hills will be ordered to cut water usage by 36% under a tough new mandate proposed by regulators on Saturday to try to help parched California cope with its extreme drought. Los Angeles will have to reduce usage by 16%; the more environmentally conscious San Francisco will only have to reduce its water consumption by 8% after doing more in the last year to cut use voluntarily, according to the California State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB). The framework of new emergency water conservation regulations was announced on Saturday as the proposed outline of efforts to conform with Governor Jerry Brown’s executive order, issued on 1 April, that California must cut water use in urban areas by 25% in the next year. Emergency regulations for agriculture in the state are still under discussion. On Saturday a table of targets – backed up with heavy potential fines for water companies – was issued to cover different cities and counties. The framework will be open for comments before a further draft is drawn up and then the final version of the regulations is issued next month. Reductions will then have to be achieved by the end of February 2016. “We don’t know when it [the drought] will end,” Felicia Marcus, chair of the SWRCB, said on Saturday. “Californians need to step up; we don’t even know if it will rain or snow much in the next year.” California is suffering from a prolonged drought, with two-thirds of the state in extreme drought conditions and 41% suffering from the most serious classification issued by state authorities – “exceptional drought”. The new proposals are likely to provoke opposition from urban water supply companies, which will be fined $10,000 a day if they fail to achieve the cuts. After four years of drought, the state has warned Californians that they need to make “real lifestyle changes”.   Related: California governor tells climate change deniers to wake up    A plan to voluntarily cut water use across the state by 20% failed, with most areas falling far short and some areas, particularly in southern California, increasing water consumption, Governor Brown said earlier this month, saying he had therefore been forced to issue an executive order. The state only managed to achieve a 9% reduction in water consumption. Under the new proposed mandate, Beverly Hills is given the most dramatic reduction level, of 36%. Also included at that level are San Bernadino County, Coachella Valley, Modesto and Tahoe City. Not far behind, Newport Beach, Sacramento County and the city of San Bernadino would be told to cut water use by 32%. Fresno, Burbank and Sonoma must slash water use by 28% under the latest proposal, with Napa and Palo Alto being told to reduce by 24%. At the lowest end of the spectrum, San Francisco and Santa Cruz will be required to cut water use by 8%. San Diego and Santa Barbara will have to cut water consumption by 16% and San Jose by 20% if the framework ends up being mandated as outlined. Under the proposals, householders would not be able to use hosepipes without shut-off mechanisms. Although hosepipes would not be banned outright, hosing sidewalks for cleanliness with potable water would be banned and only drip or micro-spray sprinklers allowed. Restaurant and café-goers will only be given glasses of tap water upon request, not automatically upon sitting down. Many establishments have been doing so voluntarily. The water restrictions will not be imposed on individual city and county authorities but on the water supply companies that services them. The state is also encouraging people to recycle water from washing machines to flush toilets or water lawns.  This article was amended on 19 April to correctly identify the percentage cut in water use proposed for Los Angeles.

"Ten years ago, an especially strong and destructive hurricane season brought Katrina to Louisiana in August, followed two months later by Wilma slamming into the Florida coast. And then, for the next 10 years, nothing: no major hurricanes have hit the United States since.  As the US approaches another hurricane season beginning on 1 June, it will also be approaching a historic milestone: there have been no category 3 or above hurricanes in nearly a decade, a stroke of luck that scientists say is truly out of the ordinary. This current “hurricane drought” is the longest ever recorded since scientists began keeping track of hurricanes in 1851. The last record of eight years happened from 1861–68. New research from Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, published this week in Geophysical Research Letters, suggests the historic drought is probably just a coincidence. “We concluded it’s basically dumb luck,” said co-author of the report and senior scientist at Nasa’s Goddard Institute Dr Timothy Hall. “If [the drought] went on and on and on we’d question our assumptions, but for now it seems to be luck.” There have been plenty of major storms and hurricanes since 2005, but all major hurricanes have missed the US and instead concentrated on other regions around the Atlantic Ocean. And there have been more minor storms that were nonetheless destructive within the US: Hurricane Sandy in 2012 (category 1), Hurricane Irene in 2011 (category 1) and Hurricane Ike in 2008 (category 2). Most of the damage from those storms came from rain and subsequent flooding (partially exacerbated by sea-level rise and storm surge).  Hall said the lack of major wind damage from hurricanes in the last decade could have serious consequences if people are lulled into a sense of complacency about extreme weather. Hall’s study, carried out with Kelly Hereid from ACE Tempest RE, a reinsurance firm, found that insurance rates were falling in hurricane-prone areas, and people were flocking to the coasts – meaning there could be more damage when a major hurricane eventually makes landfall.",2015-04-30T18:10:28Z,"US hurricane drought is 'basically dumb luck', scientists say","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""75f4e5c88d41cbea797c04afffe0b6817e0ec939""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/30/1430415132029/cf5652a1-6734-436d-b1f5-236a40871089-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was one of the last category 3 or above storms to hit the US."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was one of the last category 3 or above storms to hit the US.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Noaa handout/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>",51,"No hurricanes category 3 or above have hit the United States for a decade, the longest recorded stretch since scientists began tracking the storms",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/30/1430415132301/cf5652a1-6734-436d-b1f5-236a40871089-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/30/us-hurricane-drought-dumb-luck-katrina-wilma,8,negative
"California and the American south-west are suffering the worst drought in a generation. But despite consumers and businesses being urged to drastically cut their water usage, water parks requiring large volumes of H20 to operate rides and slides continue to open their gates to thrill-seeking hydrophiles. How is this possible? Some solutions are neither environmentally nor economically sustainable. Last summer’s drought restrictions in Wichita Falls, Texas, for example, forced the Castaway Cove attraction to truck in 9,000 gallons of water a day to stay afloat.    Related: Kathmandu: a city within sight of glaciers struggles with water crisis    The Seaworld and Aquatica water park in San Antonio, however, has successfully weathered the storm – or lack of it – for the past two and half years of drought in the city. Operators of the park, also in Texas, claim their ongoing conservation efforts mean they were well prepared for drought restrictions long before they were enforced. From using condensate water collected from air conditioning to power ornamental fountains to minimising loss through evaporation by replacing a pool’s old canvas cover with a more efficient aluminium roof, the park prides itself on its innovative conservation methods. Scooter Mangold, Seaworld and Aquatica’s vice president of general services, says they are able to capture roughly 162 gallons of condensate water an hour from just one building’s air con system. Their forward thinking, he adds, also protected the business from any public backlash resulting from tight limitations on water use. During a drought emergency, customers will inevitably ask: “How can a water park stay open when I’m not even allowed to hose my lawn?” It’s therefore important to publicise the company’s sustainable practices, explains Mangold.  “Educating the public about our conservation efforts is very important,” claims Mangold. “The work we do has always been behind the scenes, but now we are changing our approach, making visitors aware of the different innovations used to save water throughout the park to inspire our guests to make a change themselves after they have left.” Thirsty service sector Eric Hansen, director of development services for Hotel and Leisure Advisors – a US-based feasibility and market analysis company specialising in the water park sector – believes water parks need to be as responsive as possible to drought emergencies. If the authorities declare an emergency, water parks must clearly show what direct action they are going to take to tackle the event. They should also be realistic about the size of a park’s water footprint – customers may be surprised to discover it is far smaller than they originally imagined. He claims restaurants and hotels waste far more water through catering and laundry services. Because of the huge costs involved, conservation is an essential design principle when developing any water park.     A woman at a house in Porterville, California, which had no running water for several months as a result of drought Photograph: Global Warming Images/Alamy    “The key issue is to understand the difference between water use and consumption,” Hansen explains. “A water park is a very heavy water user, but that doesn’t mean every drop is going down the drain after someone has swum in it. It’s a process of reclamation, where a significant amount of the water is reused.  “When we talk about water consumption in a park, we are talking about that portion of water that is put back into the sewer and not reclaimed again.” Designing solutions The main source of loss in a water park is backwash – running water backwards through the filter to clean it out. Traditional sand filters consume 1,500 gallons of water a day, but new filters such as the Defender have reduced consumption to 450 gallons per month.  A filtration system by Creative Water Solutions, which uses sphagnum moss to inhibit the formation of organic contamination and accelerate its removal, means that parks do not have to backwash filters so often and promises to reduce the amount of chemicals needed to clean water by 90%. The company’s chief executive and co-founder, David Knighton, adds that it has the potential to save up to 950,000 gallons a year and, because the moss can be farmed naturally, the product is one of the most sustainable options on the market. Other causes of water loss, such as splashing, are less easy to solve. Jacob Tompkins, managing director of Waterwise, claims that design is key when trying to maximise conservation in a water park. But that isn’t restricted to the slides. He claims you can also use the landscape of the park to minimise losses – from looking at how you can support the way water flows across the site to how pools are positioned in relation to the direction of the sun and wind. You could even consider planting greenery to reduce wind flow across the park so any large amount of splashing from the curve of a slide isn’t lost by a strong gust.    Related: Is it fair to blame almond farmers for California’s drought?    “What you need is a holistic water audit,” he recommends. “Parks need to look at not only where they get the water from but how they dispose of it.” Collaborating for conservation There is an issue of sharing best practice, Tompkins adds. Water parks need to collaborate and cooperate better to ensure everyone involved in the process of developing an attraction is aware of the latest innovations in water conservation. Many of these can be incorporated into the design of the park during the initial planning stages, such as creating slides that reduce splashing. Investing in water conservation, he says, will not only save the park money, it will increase footfall. Tompkins says: “If you take care of these environmental aspects it will increase the general overall performance of the park. If you are constantly looking at how you can design your rides to minimise things like splash loss it means you are spending a lot of time looking at the rides, which increases safety and even enjoyability.  “It might well be that you save more water and as a result can increase the splashing where the customer drops. So instead of it leaking out, you have more to squirt on people.” The water hub is funded by Grundfos. All content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled ‘brought to you by’.

"The California drought is an all-encompassing natural disaster that requires everyone in the state to share the sacrifices and work cooperatively on long-term solutions to this critical water situation (In parched California, there’s still plenty of water for nut trees – and for Nestle’s bottles, 20 April). Despite suggestions to the contrary, farmers have been sharing the pain as all Californians work to get through the drought. Federal and state agencies slashed agricultural water supplies deeply last year, fallowing 500,000 acres of farmland at the cost of $1.5bn and eliminating 17,000 jobs in the region. This year promises to be even tougher as the drought continues. Agriculture will get just 20% of its normal state water allocation and zero federal water at all for the second straight year. Contrary to some claims, almond farms occupy less than 12% of the state’s total irrigated farmland and use only about 8% of the agricultural (not total) water supply. Of these, 90% are family owned and about 75% are less than 100 acres. As such, farmers in the region know the value of water on a very personal level, and are taking steps to use their allocation as resourcefully as possible. To support this push for water efficiency, the Almond Board of California has funded 87 irrigation research projects to date. With 70% of almond orchards now using micro-irrigation systems, the amount of water needed to produce each pound of almonds has been driven down by 33%. Our farmers engage every day in advancing methods that save water, while still producing a large share of the US and global food supply. We want to be part of the solution to this drought and know we have more to do, but suggestions that agriculture and specifically almond farmers are reacting irresponsibly to this water shortage are completely unfounded.Richard WaycottCEO, Almond Board of California",2015-04-29T18:01:32Z,Almond farmers are acting responsibly during California’s devastating drought,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""ee314713ba75e8e3baf9b069da9e79bc44453f97""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/29/1430317084705/Almonds-ready-for-harvest-005.jpg"" alt=""Almonds ready for harvest in Hilmar, California, In 2011."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Almonds ready for harvest in Hilmar, California, In 2011.

"For the past eight years, California politicians, utility companies, farmers and environmentalists have been arguing over the Bay Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP). Environmental groups are now speaking out after recent announcements that the conservation part of the plan has been shelved.  Authorities have billed the BDCP as a comprehensive strategy to restore a sensitive, damaged ecological area and reliably deliver water from the wetter northern regions of California to the drier south.  Critics, however, argue that the purpose of the plan is to justify charging taxpayers to fund an expensive project to divert water to California’s agricultural regions, in effect subsidising agribusinesses in a water-scarce region. $240m (£157m) has been spent on the plan’s research and development to date.   Related: US water parks stricken by drought attempt to conserve a dwindling resource    Earlier this month, California governor Jerry Brown announced that the BDCP would be moving forward without the habitat conservation part of the plan. The state’s natural resources director, Richard Stapler, says a parallel conservation effort will ensure the protection of habitat and fisheries, but environmental groups are angry and frustrated, calling the announcement a classic case of bait and switch.  A river runs through it The Sacramento Delta sits at the intersection of California’s two largest rivers - the Sacramento and the San Joaquin. A large pump in the Delta takes water from the region and sends it south, negatively impacting water quality and fisheries in the process.  Even those who benefit from the export of Delta water - farmers in the Central Valley and urban water districts - complain about the current infrastructure. Because 21 Delta fish are listed as endangered, the pump cannot be operated as often as originally intended.     Efforts to protect the finger-sized Delta smelt, which lives only in the wetlands stretching north of San Francisco, have been met with mixed reactions. Photograph: Peter Johnsen/ US Fish and Wildlife Service    Jason Peltier, chief deputy general manager of Westlands Water District, a 600,000-acre agricultural district in San Joaquin Valley, blames the Endangered Species Act more than drought for his farmers’ water woes. “The focus is on limiting the movement of water from the Delta south,” he says. “That has resulted in chronic shortages for us - we have only had our expected supply for three of the last 20 years.” The BDCP would replace the pump with two 35-mile tunnels taking water from the Sacramento River, underground past the Delta, and delivering it to export pumps near Tracy, about 60 miles east of San Francisco. From there, an existing system of pumps, canals and aqueducts will deliver the water to Los Angeles, Silicon Valley and millions of acres of farmland in central California.    The economic system we have rewards the sale of water, so water utilities lose money when they sell less water.  Peter Gleick     Putting a price on water The tunnels are estimated to cost $12-14bn to build, but given expected construction overruns and maintenance costs, the overall budget has been estimated at $50 to $64bn . That cost will largely be covered by property taxes and water rate hikes. Critics have complained that agricultural water districts will have an unfair advantage: the ability to re-sell their BDCP water supply. In a 2014 Kern County Water District policy document, the largest Central Valley water agency indicates its intention to sell any excess supply it receives from the BDCP tunnels, in an effort to offset construction costs. In a 2012 senate hearing on the project, Westlands’ Peltier said he couldn’t assure legislators that his district wouldn’t end up re-selling BDCP water. While it makes sense that water agencies recoup their investments, BDCP critics are concerned that the policy sets a precedent for the privatisation of a public resource. “They continue to say we’re about farming,” says Barbara Barrigan-Perilla, executive director of nonprofit Restore the Delta. “But the reality is that in 25 to 30 years those drainage-impaired lands in Westlands will have to be retired no matter what.” Westlands has in fact already retired some 300,000 acres, about half the district, according to Peltier. The district has bought back water rights from several of those farmers. “I think that’s the end-goal: farms will have to be retired, farmers will walk away with settlements from the federal government, and Westlands Water District will buy back water rights and re-sell their existing shares of water,” says Barrigan-Perilla. It’s indicative of a larger issue in California. “The economic system we have rewards the sale of water, so water utilities lose money when they sell less water,” says Peter Gleick, executive director of Pacific Institute. “We learned in the energy business to decouple efficiency from rates and reward efficiency, and we could do the same with water.” The ‘bare-minimum’ approach The now-scrapped habitat restoration component of the BDCP had earmarked $8bn and 140,000 acres of habitat. By separating restoration from the permitting of the tunnels, Stapler says restoration efforts can start immediately. He has also said that some of the funds made available under California’s Water Action Act (Proposition 1) will be used, but it’s unclear how the state will get anywhere near the $8bn originally intended for habitat restoration. In addition, the separate restoration plan will not address any issues caused by the tunnels themselves, over which both environmental groups and government agencies have voiced concerns. Last year, the US Environmental Protection Agency asked for a more thorough environmental impact analysis, with particular focus on water quality and the tunnels’ impact on fisheries (most notably salmon).   Related: Five years after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, we are closer than ever to catastrophe    Nonetheless, Stapler is convinced that the state needs to pursue every course of action: alternative water strategies, restoration and the completion of the tunnels.  “The Delta provides a substantial amount of the basic water supply for 25 million people,” he says. “We know that working toward an ideal of regional self-reliance is important. However, we must also maintain and improve our current system because we will continue to rely on it well into the foreseeable future.” According to Chelsea Tu, staff attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, in addition to taking a “bare-minimum approach” to environmental impacts, the new plan puts the tunnels project in the hands of federal permitting agencies, effectively bypassing the public. “Now Californians will not have a say in a project that is so costly and has so many environmental impacts,” Tu says.

Southern California cities, where residents used more water than ever this February (pdf), as the state rolled into its fourth consecutive drought year. And Governor Jerry Brown, who is either anti-agriculture or anti-urban dweller, depending on who you’re speaking with.    Related: California governor tells climate change deniers to wake up    But the biggest villain this year has been the state’s almond growers, accused of gobbling up land and water, replacing more water-efficient crops like lettuce and strawberries with higher value almond crops, and taking more than their fair share of the state’s water.  There are a few reasons almonds have become this season’s bad guy: A major spike in planting (25% from 2013 to 2014, according to statistics on sales of new almond trees), the increase in almond acres owned by investment firms, the fact that the majority of the state’s almonds are planted in one of its driest regions (San Joaquin Valley), and the skyrocketing demand for almond milk. All have been pointed to as unnecessary drivers of California’s water emergency.      Fruit developing on an almond tree. Photograph: Tom Rogers     Related: Alarm as almond farmers consume California's water    “The whole thing is completely ridiculous,” says Richard Howitt, an agricultural economist at the University of California at Davis. “The almonds don’t use any more water than most other food crops – they require a bit more than alfalfa and less than various vegetables and fruit. And they’re a very water-efficient way to provide protein. Overall, almonds take about 10% of the state’s water but they produce a tremendous amount of value, jobs, income, and a healthy product. So why they became the bad guys I don’t know.”  But according to Barbara Barrigan-Parrilla, executive director of environmental group Restore the Delta, there’s one very good reason to point the finger at almond growers: “30 to 40 years ago, before you had the agri-chemical revolution and new equipment that made these bad soils easier to farm, people down there [in San Joaquin Valley] grew what they were supposed to grow with extra water: lettuce and tomatoes,” she says. “And in drought years, they fallowed those fields and grew grain to save water. So they could plant according to the amount of water available.  “Now they‘ve gone crazy for almonds and they don’t do that anymore. They’re fallowing a bit more now because of the drought, but still almost everything is planted, post to post, with almonds, which are a permanent crop. That hardens the water demand, and they can’t go backwards without losing a lot of money.” The water steward Tom Rogers’ grandparents emigrated from Italy to Madera, in the San Joaquin Valley (also known as the Central Valley), in 1916, and bought the 175 acres on which Rogers’ almond farm now sits. Back then, his grandfather ran a dairy on the land. When Rogers’ father took over the farm, he raised cattle on pasture for a while, and then grew a variety of row crops – alfalfa, cotton, corn – before planting his first almond trees in 1981. Those first trees were pulled out and replaced with new trees this year. By 2006, the farm was planted entirely in almonds.      Planting new almond trees. Photograph: Tom Rogers    Rogers says he and his brother, with whom he now owns and runs the farm, decided to stick with almonds because it’s a long-term investment crop. “With only 175 acres, it’s tough to buy equipment for two or three different crops,” he says.  Unlike some of the larger corporate almond farms, Rogers has also made substantial investments in technology to better manage his water use.  “My brother and I always say that we’re really blessed because our dad started to pay attention to water efficiency a long time ago. He was measuring soil moisture and adjusting watering back in the early 80s.”  Today, that simple measuring system has transformed into a network of wireless sensors connected to the internet, telling the Rogers brothers in real time exactly what their trees are using and when. This year the brothers installed weather stations as well.  They also use a pulse irrigation system so that they can put water on the trees for an hour, then off for two hours, on again for another hour, and so on. Rogers says this holds water in the upper layers of the soil, which is where almond trees want it.     Irrigation control machinery. Photograph: Tom Rogers    Although Rogers says he thinks it’s unfair to demonise almond growers, in some ways he understands. “It’s a high-value crop and the money’s been good the past five years,” he says. “It always feels good to point the finger at people making money. Society needs a villain and right now we’re convenient.”  “ I will carefully admit there has been an awful lot of almonds planted that maybe shouldn’t have been because outside money came in and wanted to plant,” he says. “I’ve had real estate brokers call me and say ‘hey, you hear of any land you give me a call.’ But I understand why they’re doing it: almonds are doing good, so what are you gonna do, plant grapes? They’re a drag right now.” Managing groundwater The response of farmers to accusations that they’re using too much water often falls along the lines of ‘if you want to stop eating, we’ll stop growing food.’ And the solutions proposed by many environmental advocates is unpalatable to agri-businesses.  Barrigan-Parrilla, for example, suggests fallowing much of the almond orchards in Westlands Water District, which covers large swaths of land in Fresno and Kern Counties. But Howitt says that while it is a problem that so much farmland has shifted from more adjustable crops to perennials like almonds, he has a simpler solution: better management of groundwater.  After years of failing to manage groundwater at all, in 2014 California passed its first ever groundwater regulation, making it the last of the country’s parched western states to do so. Although environmentalists applauded the move, farmers generally fought it and delayed its implementation by what most, including Howitt, consider a foolish amount of time.    Related: How much do you know about your nuts?    The state’s counties have until 2017 to select or establish an agency to manage groundwater, and until 2020 to draw up groundwater management plans, with a target of sustainable groundwater use by 2040. In the meantime, it’s business as usual, which means farmers can use (or buy) as much groundwater as they like.  This doesn’t mean that California farmers aren’t concerned about their use of groundwater.  Wisconsin-based Wellntel, which provides sensors for wells that tell farmers how much groundwater they have and how much they’re using, begins shipping product this month. CEO Marian Singer says the company was getting requests from Californian farmers even before the groundwater regulations were passed.  Part of the selling point of Wellntel is that farmers can keep their groundwater data private, which Howitt says is something will have to change. “There’s this Daniel Boone, pioneer mentality around water rights and this whole silliness about not reporting what you’re pumping,” he says. “It’s a really archaic way of looking at a collective resource. And it doesn’t necessarily benefit farmers: If I have a well on my land, I want to know about what’s going on with the other wells around me so I can get a sense of whether mine is going to run dry.”  Rogers says in years where surface water is available he’ll use that, even when it’s more expensive, but last year and this year his irrigation district has had zero surface water available, so he irrigates from the groundwater wells on his property. Those wells have traditionally been recharged by runoff from the snow pack in the Sierra mountains, but that snow pack is at about 6% of its usual size this year.                California drought: no snow to replenish reservoirs for the first time in 75 years.    Rogers is one the the rare farmers who is grudgingly in favour of the state’s groundwater rules.  “It will be invasive, and I’m certain it will end up restricting the amount of groundwater I’m allowed to use,” he says. “Instead of 175 acres, I’ll maybe be able to farm 100. So do I like it? No. But it is way better than the alternative, which is that it manages itself. I’d rather take care of it and be able to plan for the future.”  The know your nuts series is funded by Olam. All content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled ‘brought to you by’.

Public lawns will be replaced with “drought tolerant landscaping” and enforced cuts to water-usage of 25% will be mandatory for California’s 38 million residents. Meanwhile, farmers, who use the majority of the state’s water supply, face further unemployment and low yield as more fields are left fallow.

"Television is all that separates MLS from becoming the truly major league its name bills it as, or so the commonly repeated rhetoric goes. For all that Stateside soccer has drawn a steep growth curve over the past decade – building state-of-the art venues, expanding to 20 franchises, having the third-highest average attendance of a sports league in the US and generally finding credibility – television is the one barrier the league has left to clear. Perhaps the new eight-year agreement with ESPN, Fox and Univision – signed last May and reported to be worth a combined $90m – will change that. MLS wants more than just a bolstered revenue stream from its new domestic broadcast deal. Ratings and engagement, rather than attendance figures, are now the yardstick by which the league’s progress is gauged. The same could now be said for such development outside North America too. On the face of it, MLS’s new four-year deal with Sky Sports – which sees the Rupert Murdoch-owned British broadcaster show at least two regular-season games a week, as well as the All-Star game, every play-off fixture and the MLS Cup final – is little more than just another television deal with just another broadcaster.  But with this new partnership, soccer in North America has gained a degree of legitimacy in the UK, something it has often struggled for. BT Sport – the previous holder of MLS rights in the UK – has made quite the impression since its launch in August 2013, splurging £897m on three years of exclusive Champions League rights from next season, but Sky Sports can be worn as a badge of authenticity by MLS. Imagine a television drama switching from Lifetime to HBO. In sporting terms, that’s what MLS has done in Britain. Apart from anything else MLS will now be showcased to a bigger audience in the UK, with Sky Sports boasting over 10 million subscribers compared to BT Sport’s 2.5 million. This year’s season-opener between Orlando City and New York City FC drew 36,000 viewers and many more through the broadcaster’s on-demand service. The production value isn’t quite of Super Bowl standard – with nothing more than an announcer and a colour commentator speaking over a centralised feed – but nonetheless, MLS has heightened its visibility in soccer’s hottest hotbed. “This is another important moment that shows the continued growth of MLS,” said David Beckham - Sky Sports ambassador and MLS cheerleader - in a statement released upon news of the deal’s completion. “I have seen first-hand how popular soccer has become in America. Having fantastic partners such as Sky Sports on board will not only add to the coverage of the game, it will also broaden its appeal outside of the US.” Disregard Beckham’s glossy, PR-talk and the former LA Galaxy man prompts a pertinent point of discussion. For so long MLS has focused its efforts on growing and developing within its own borders, and understandably so. Globalisation doesn’t work without a key demographic to begin with. But has the time come for MLS to consciously evolve its appeal and image abroad? If so, has such an effort started with its new British broadcast deal? MLS doesn’t just have increased TV prominence in the UK this season, it also seems to have found its own time slot in Britain’s crowded television sports schedule. On BT Sport, MLS struggled for a regular and consistent time slot. There was no routine behind what Stateside soccer was broadcast on the channel, with only the LA Galaxy and the New York Red Bulls receiving any live coverage during the regular season. On weeks when no live games were shown, MLS fans would have to make do with highlights – sometimes broadcast in the early hours. Sky Sports too has been somewhat guilty of focusing on the league’s marquee teams – having broadcast all three of New York City FC’s opening games this season, capitalising on any interest sprung from the franchise’s close links with Manchester City – but the same could be said of essentially every division the world over. The exact scheduling might not give a full picture of MLS, but that there is a picture given at all – at a set time, every week – represents progress. After ‘Super Sunday’ and the Premier League’s weekly dose of afternoon hyperbole, as well as whatever offerings La Liga, Serie A and Ligue 1 has for cultured europhiles, but before the BBC’s Match of the Day 2, is where MLS has positioned itself - at 10pm GMT on Sundays. And it’s not a bad position to be in. British sports fans will watch live soccer, regardless of where it is played, especially when nothing else is on. So what’s in this new agreement for Sky Sports? Why has MLS been added to a stable which already holds rights for English Premier League, La Liga, Scottish Premiership and Dutch Eredivisie games? The belief that Brits are unwilling to embrace the ‘Americanisation’ of sport is something of a misconception. Tickets for NFL games at Wembley Stadium sell out within minutes, with the same going for NBA games played at London’s O2 Arena. Even at local level, attendances are burgeoning across the country’s ice hockey and basketball leagues as fans look for the family-friendly, confetti-sprinkled sporting spectacle soccer generally can’t offer. Sky Sports has translated such an appeal into success with its NFL coverage – which attracted close to 14 million British viewers over the course of last season – and is now counting on the same allure to make a success of MLS in the UK. At odds with pretty much the rest of the soccer world, scheduling barbs have been angled at MLS ever since the day of its inception as a predominantly summertime pursuit. It is often claimed that implementing a more orthodox calendar – in keeping with Europe and Fida’s mandatory international dates – would aid the league’s global appeal, and yet the very opposite seems to be true in the case of Sky Sports’ interest in MLS. Wimbledon and cricket can only fill so much airtime over the British summer – when Europe’s soccer leagues take their off-season break. A cynic would claim MLS has been bought as summertime fodder by Sky Sports, but whether or not that is true should be of little concern to the league. Either way, the league has found more than just a wider audience and a niche market in the UK, but a stamp of approval too.",2015-04-08T10:00:08Z,MLS's UK TV deal can exploit Europe's summertime football drought,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-e277906e-d37d-4284-9908-29d5aba235b5""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/7/1428444553916/572006b1-17c6-42cb-9eaa-ecbf484893d2-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""MLS fans"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Fans cheer during the inaugural MLS game between New York City FC and Orlando City. </span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Joe Burbank/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>",57,"<strong>Graham Ruthven:</strong> The league is now broadcast live in the UK, something that could help boost its growth in the US<br>",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/7/1428444554651/3eeed411-78fd-497f-ad8f-80f1a0534873-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/apr/08/mlss-uk-tv-deal-can-exploit-europes-summertime-football-drought,2,positive
"California’s drought is threatening Beverly Hills with a triple whammy on its lawns, pools and checkbooks. New water restrictions could limit watering to two days a week, ban draining and refilling of existing swimming pools and set fines of up to $1,000 for violations. The city council is also considering banning washing cars outside homes and ordering restaurants to serve water only upon request. Long associated with wealth, glamour and luxury, Beverly Hills has now acquired notoriety as one of California’s biggest per-capita water guzzlers – more than 215 gallons daily. Four consecutive years of drought prompted Governor Jerry Brown earlier this month to impose a mandatory 25% cut in urban water use compared with 2013.  As an especially profligate user, Beverly Hills must cut consumption by 36% by February. San Bernadino County, Coachella Valley, Modesto and Tahoe City are facing a similar target. Newport Beach, Sacramento County and the city of San Bernadino are just behind, with 32%. Los Angeles, by contrast, will have to reduce usage by 16%, while uber-conserver San Francisco will have to reduce consumption by only 8% after impressive voluntary cuts last year, according to the California State Water Resources Control Board.  Nestled between Santa Monica and West Hollywood, Beverly Hills has been in the second stage of its emergency water conservation plan, which sought 10% savings with voluntary measures. The city council is now considering three sets of tougher restrictions. The most drastic would activate the fourth stage of the emergency plan, which, among other things, would turn off fountains and ban refilling pools, spas and ponds except when necessary for health. The city manager would decide when residents and businesses could water their landscapes. Violators could be charged with misdemeanors and fined up to $1,000. Another option would go to stage three of the emergency plan, with milder restrictions and penalties to achieve a 20% reduction. A hybrid third option would demand 30% cuts. The state-mandated 36% conservation benchmark may be revised before state regulators formally adopt an emergency water plan next month. Critics of the measures complain that agriculture, which accounts for 80% of California’s human water use, has been given a free pass. Farmers dispute that. Two-thirds of California is enduring “extreme” drought conditions and 41% is suffering “exceptional” drought, according to official designations.",2015-04-22T20:43:51Z,California drought threatens luxe Beverly Hills lawns and swimming pools,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""2f8bbc07f8ff147c3794bf08b8ba05fb3914827a""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/22/1429734854337/8882725804_e2ab79fa44_o-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""The Beverly Hills Hotel."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The Beverly Hills Hotel. <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/alan-light/8882725804/"">Photograph: Alan Light/flickr</a></span> </figcaption> </figure>",58,"Violations of proposed water restrictions could carry $1,000 fine as city guzzles more than 215 gallons of water per capita every day",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/22/1429734854649/8882725804_e2ab79fa44_o-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/22/california-drought-beverly-hills-lawns-pools,0,negative
"It’s hard to overestimate the appalling environmental and economic crisis that’s brewing in Brazil right now. The country is in the grip of a crippling megadrought – the result of pollution, deforestation and climate change – that deeply threatens its economy, society and environment. And the damage may be permanent: São Paulo, Brazil’s largest city and industrial center, has begun rationing water and is discussing whether or not it will need to depopulate in the near future.  But if Brazil’s drought is shocking, Wall Street’s shortsighted approach to the country is appalling. Institutional investors’ reports on the country – the seventh largest economy in the world – cite worries about inflation, government cutbacks and low consumer confidence. But I could not find a single analysis that mentioned the existential threat facing the country: the megadrought that is expected to last decades and could destroy the Brazilian economy. Not a single analysis cited the brutal global impact that this will cause. In other words, a host of institutional investors have found worrisome things to say about Brazil, but none seem to be aware of – or, at least, willing to face – the country’s greatest threat.  Attempting to separate economies from environment – as many of these analysts seem to do – is like trying to separate mind and body. It simply doesn’t work.  We will never repair our business models and government policies to conform to the real environmental constraints of the 21st century until we repair this fundamental flaw in our economic system. Investors and analysts regularly review a host of factors – including national debt, inflation, currency devaluation and other financial considerations – when they formulate their economic predictions. Their decision to omit the environment as a fundamental economic consideration is willfully ignorant and negligent.    Keep it in the Ground embed   Economies are cyclical, with periods of boom and bust. But a lack of water can cause permanent damage. São Paolo, which is one of the richest cities in the world, serves as the financial center for most of South America. The consequences of this drought are hard to calculate, but one can get an idea by imagining how water rationing in New York City – and the attendant population drop, public outcry and social instability – would affect the world’s economy.  This lack of foresight on the part of financial analysts is nothing new. They are overlooking this high risk situation, just as they did with the dotcom boom and bust, the subprime global meltdown, and a host of other financial crises. This willful delusion is also cyclical, and also a significant threat to the world’s economy. I have worked with dozens of multinational corporations on transformative projects and initiatives that cut or eliminate waste, water usage, emissions and energy consumption. Every single company has had the same complaint: they do something spectacularly difficult and smart that enhances their company’s long-term financial security. But, when it comes time for the quarterly earnings calls with Wall Street, no one ever asks about it.  Executives are responsible for maintaining a stable supply chain, a predictable P&amp;L, a respectable brand image, and a keen awareness of competition and regulations. Sustainable business innovation connects with all of these, and is one of the pillars needed to keep a modern financial house in order. Unfortunately, Wall Street doesn’t seem to notice.   Related: Political will is the biggest barrier to tackling global water risk    This is as egregious as ignoring subprime debt in 2007. In India – the world’s fastest-growing economy and the darling of Wall Street – one out of six deaths each year is caused by air pollution. Factor in water and pesticide issues, and the death toll creeps higher. (I guess all that economic growth will help pay for all those health care costs.)  Just as in China, India’s wealthy people are moving their kids away from the big cities and centers of pollution. But clean air and water ought to be human rights, not luxuries reserved for the rich. There are so many parables about the cost of money, from Midas who died of starvation and killed his beloved daughter when he valued nothing more than gold, to the New Testament, where Jesus teaches about the price of a rich man’s soul. But we don’t have to get religious to agree that without clean air, land and water, and a stable climate, we all suffer.

"The governor of California has ordered unprecedented and mandatory water restrictions in the state as officials conducted a regular measurement of the Sierra Nevada snowpack and found “no snow whatsoever” amid the state’s ongoing drought.  “This was the first time in 75 years of early-April measurements at the Phillips snow course that no snow was found there,” the California Department of Water Resources said in a statement on Wednesday at the conclusion of a survey attended by the Governor Jerry Brown. It said readings from Wednesday put the state’s level of water content at just 5% of the historical average for the date. “Today’s survey underscores the severity of California’s drought,” said DWR director Mark Cowin. “Water conservation must become a way of life during the worst drought in most Californians’ lifetimes.” Brown on Wednesday ordered the State Water Resources Control Board to reduce statewide water use by 25%. The action – the first time ever state officials have imposed mandatory water restrictions – is expected to save 1.5m acre-feet of water by the year’s end.   Related: California drought goes from bad to worse as state grapples with heat wave    Experts say a massive response is needed to confront California’s punishing dry spell, now languishing into a fourth year and exacerbated by scorching temperatures. Saying “a distinct possibility exists that the current drought will stretch into a fifth straight year in 2016 and beyond,” Brown’s order requires city and town water suppliers to reduce per capita usage. Brown’s order would also:  prohibit watering ornamental grass on public street medians; require new homes to use water-efficient drip irrigation system for landscaping; direct urban water agencies to set up a new pricing structure to maximize water conservation; require urban water and agricultural agencies to report more water usage information to the state.  “It’s a different world,” Brown said. “We have to act differently.” Brown made the announcement while standing on a patch of brown grass in the Sierra Nevada, which would have historically been covered in snow.  “This historic drought demands unprecedented action,” Brown said in a statement. “Therefore, I’m issuing an executive order mandating substantial water reductions across our state. As Californians, we must pull together and save water in every way possible.” The 1 April snowpack survey is an important indicator of the amount of water the state will have in its reservoirs as the state’s wet historically wet season winds down. “In what were considered normal precipitation years, the snowpack supplied about 30 percent of California’s water needs as it melts in the spring and summer,” the DWR said in a statement on Wednesday. California relies on a few big storms during the winter months to drop snow on California’s mountain ranges. During the spring and summer months the snowpack melts and fills the state’s reservoirs. Historically, 1 April marked peak snowpack for the year. This year, the mountain runoff will be just a trickle.David Rizzardo, chief of snow surveys for the California Department of Water Resources, said the previous driest condition on the 1 April was 25%, which occurred in 2014 and 1977. “We’re not only setting a new low, we’re completely obliterating the previous record,” he said on a conference call with reporters. “And this is the supply of 30% of the state’s fresh water.” To conduct the survey, the state’s water agency dispatches researchers to measure the level of snow manually at 250 separate sites in the Sierra Nevada, Rizzardo said. Additionally, the survey includes readings from 130 automated snow sensors. An official count will be released on Wednesday afternoon. Last week, Brown signed into law a more-than-$1bn plan to fast-track emergency relief to drought-stricken cities and communities, including food aid and drinking water. The proposal also includes hundreds of millions of dollars to fund long-term projects, involving water recycling, conservation awareness and flood control projects. At the signing, Brown said the plan was part of a wider effort to prepare California for an “uncertain future”. The package followed action by the state water board this month to pass what has been described as the most restrictive water conservation measures in state history.

"  Related: California farmers resign themselves to drought: 'Nobody's fault but God's'    Spring is starting to feel a lot like summer in California, as a record-setting heat wave punishes the parched state now in its fourth year of what is said to be the worst drought in a millennium. Experts say the scorching spring days are part of a long-term warming pattern – driven largely by human activity – that is increasing the chances that future droughts will be as bad as this one. At fault is a warm and dry weather combination, which exacerbates the already dire drought conditions by drying soil, melting snow and driving up water usage. “It’s like a one-two punch,” said Jeanine Jones, deputy drought manager for the state Department of Water Resources (DWR). “Not having enough water to fill our reservoirs and having the hot weather evaporate the little that we do have.”  According to the most recent US drought report, moderately below-average precipitation, coupled with extremely above-average temperatures, has maintained or worsened drought conditions in California. The consequences have been devastating, from shriveling reservoirs to vanishing groundwater, dying crops, thinning herds and raging wildfires. California relies on a series of massive storms during the winter months to drop snow on the Cascades and Sierra Nevada mountain ranges. During the spring and summer months the snowpack, acting like a natural reservoir, melts as water demand rises. But the recent extremely warm weather has caused precipitation to fall as rain rather than snow. The effect is dramatically less snowpack melt from the state’s mountain ranges, which can provide as much as a third of California’s water supply. This year, the mountain runoff will likely be just a trickle. Snow on the mountains has fallen to 12% of average levels, from 28% last year. In March, data collected from parts of the Cascade and Sierra Nevada mountains indicated that some sites were for the first time snow-free by the first of the month. Jones said the 1 April snowpack measurements, which will be reported next week, are expected to be the lowest on record. “That does not at all bode well for our depleted reservoirs,” Jones said. Hotter temperatures are predicted to be the new norm in California, the result of rising temperatures under climate change. This month, for the first time since record keeping began in the late 1880s, the temperature in Los Angeles peaked in the 90s fahrenheit for six consecutive days, according to the Los Angeles Times. Based on the current warming trajectory, the likelihood that low rain years will coincide with high heat years is almost a certainty. “California is in a climate regime where are much more likely to get this kind of drought event again because of the role of temperature rise,” said Stanford University professor Noah Diffenbaugh, who led a study examining the role of warm temperatures in California’s droughts. That study, published earlier this month in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that historically, California’s worst droughts occurred when conditions were both dry and warm, and that those conditions had occurred more frequently in the past two decades than in the last century. Diffenbaugh said global warming was increasing the risk that dry and warm years would coincide to almost ensure a drought similar to the present one. The researchers also found that in the early and mid-20th century, the warm and dry conditions occurred more or less independently. “We’re heading into a regime where the temperature is essentially always conducive to drought,” he said. With no foreseeable end to the drought in sight, policy makers at every level are scrambling to conserve the little water the state does have and avert dire predictions that the state could run out of a water soon, possibly in one year. “This is a struggle,” California governor Jerry Brown said at a press conference earlier this month. “Something we’re going to have to live with. For how long, we’re not sure.” On Friday, Brown signed into law a more-than-$1bn plan to fast-track emergency relief to drought-stricken cities and communities, including food aid and drinking water. The proposal also includes hundreds of millions of dollars to fund long-term projects, involving water recycling, conservation awareness and flood control projects. At the signing, Brown said the plan was part of a wider effort to prepare California for an “uncertain future”. The legislation followed action by the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) this month to pass what has been described as the most restrictive water conservation measures in state history. The plan limits the number of days residents can water their yards, and requires bars and restaurants to ask customers if they would like a glass of water before serving it. “We are not seeing the level of stepping up and ringing the alarm bells that the situation warrants,” Felicia Marcus, the chairwoman of the SWRCB, said during the meeting this month. She said the measure was a first step, and that the board may consider even more stringent measures this spring.   Related: Marijuana cultivation in California is sucking streams dry, says new report    Amir AghaKouchak, an assistant professor at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Irvine, said the $1bn water spending plan included “forward looking” measures that would help the state prepare for future dry spells. For example, the plan aims to improve infrastructure such as the state’s levees, which could help replenish underground aquifers, which have been drained by farmers drilling for groundwater to irrigate crops. But he warned that there is still a lot scientists don’t know about droughts. “We still don’t know a lot about how droughts develop, how they form, why they form,” AghaKouchak said. “If California wants to stay at the front of this, we have to consider science, and the best science. But it requires support.” AghaKouchak said investing in “basic research” around water technology, water management and water harvesting could in the long-run improve strategies for responding to extreme weather. He also called for funding research to create better risk-assessment models to improve the predictability of droughts. While there are conservation and planning policies that lawmakers can take now to conserve water and prepare the state for the next extreme weather event, California’s best hope lies ultimately in the willingness of the global community to confront climate change. “This drought is not a local California issue,” AghaKouchak said. “This is a global issue. A single policymaker, or even all policymakers in California, alone cannot really do much about global temperature. This requires unprecedented international efforts and a truly global will to address these issues.”",2015-03-29T14:29:21Z,California drought goes from bad to worse as state grapples with heat wave,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""f0e910ac4279ab66116e8dcb95b9fcb46118e19c""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/29/1427638535486/56b169e5-add6-4919-ba9f-5c6283bcde80-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""california drought lake mcclure la grange"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A concrete block that was used to moor a boat sits in dry cracked earth that used to be the bottom of Lake McClure in La Grange, California.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",61,Experts say fix requires global effort going into an era of climate change in which ‘the temperature is essentially always conducive to drought’,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/29/1427638535760/56b169e5-add6-4919-ba9f-5c6283bcde80-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/29/california-drought-heat-wave-climate-change,4,negative
"There’s a rapidly growing body of scientific research finding that California is in the midst of its worst drought in over a millennium, global warming has made the drought worse, and decades-long mega-droughts could become the norm in the state later this century. A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS) by scientists at Stanford University adds to this bleak picture for the Golden State. There has been some confusion about the human contribution to California’s drought, now entering its fourth consecutive year, because some reports have said that humans have not influenced the amount of precipitation falling in the state thus far. This is a subject of debate – some studies have found evidence of a human ‘fingerprint’ in the high pressure ridge that’s diverted storms away from California over the past three years. But overall, while precipitation has been low, there have been a few years in the historical record where it was lower. However, evidence indicates that California is in the midst of its worst drought in over 1,200 years. The new PNAS paper helps reconcile these two facts. As an accompanying commentary by Michael Mann and Peter Gleick notes,  Part of the challenge is that the term “drought” can be defined in different ways: for example, meteorological, hydrological, agricultural, and socioeconomic drought. Drought, most simply defined, is the mismatch between the amounts of water nature provides and the amounts of water that humans and the environment demand.  California’s worst droughts have historically happened in years that are both dry and hot. While humans may or may not be influencing the amount of rain falling in the state, we are indisputably making it hotter. If we could flip coins representing precipitation and temperature each year, the first could come up wet or dry, but humans are weighting the second such that it will increasingly come up hot. This will make conditions like those that caused California’s current record-breaking drought return more often as the planet keeps warming.     California temperature (°F) and precipitation (inches) anomalies from January 1895 to November 2014, plotted as 3-year anomalies relative to 1901–2000 mean. Data from the National Climatic Data Center nClimDiv dataset. Source: PNAS; Mann &amp; Gleick (2015).    The PNAS paper summarizes the significance of these findings.  California ranks first in the United States in population, economic activity, and agricultural value. The state is currently experiencing a record-setting drought, which has led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk ... we find that human emissions have increased the probability that low-precipitation years are also warm, suggesting that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of the co-occurring warm–dry conditions that have created the current California drought.  Mann and Gleick similarly note that the Golden State is quickly becoming an arid brown state, but that we still have an opportunity to stop this dangerous transition.  As drought has taken hold, the Golden State is slowly becoming a more arid, brown state, where constraints on water availability threaten a large and growing population (up nearly 80% since the severe drought of 1976–77), unique ecological resources, a major source of agricultural produce, and one of the largest economies in the world ... That might sound like bad news, and certainly the trends are moving rapidly in the wrong direction. The good news, however, is that this is only one possible future. If society works to limit global warming to under 2 °C, which is still possible (1), then we can likely avoid committing to a brown California. California still has a chance to remain the Golden State.  In fact, California has become a leader in tackling global warming, with a carbon pricing system as part of the strictest climate-related regulations in the United States. With such a large economy and agricultural sector, drought impacts on California will be felt far beyond the state’s borders, and California can’t slow global warming on its own. Fortunately there’s some evidence that we may be turning the corner towards solving the problem. However, more action is needed to prevent the Golden State from turning brown.",2015-03-30T13:00:03Z,Global warming and drought are turning the Golden State brown,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""1b2bf696708cabe3c102dd0321399d5749fc8244""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/28/1427581096269/3387b059-93c2-4c10-a545-f194471a28cb-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Irrigation water runs along a dried-up ditch between rice farms in Richvale, California."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Irrigation water runs along a dried-up ditch between rice farms in Richvale, California.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Jae C.

"When Santiago hosts the final of the Copa América on 4 July this year, it will be 22 years to the day since Gabriel Batistuta received a quick throw-in from Diego Simeone, turned away from Mexico’s Raúl Gutiérrez and curled a brisk left-foot finish into the bottom corner of Jorge Campos’s net. It was a goal that meant Argentina defended their continental crown; it was also the last time that any Argentinian scored a winner in a major international final. Nobody could have foreseen then that seven Copas América and six World Cups later, Argentina would still be waiting for another title. They have won five Under-20 World Cups and two Olympics in that time, their clubs have lifted the Libertadores eight times since but the drought at full international level goes on. The urge to scratch that itch has motivated almost everything Gerardo Martino has done since he replaced Alejandro Sabella as the Argentina coach, and certainly explains why his squad selection, even for the upcoming friendlies against El Salvador and Ecuador, seems so conservative. The rhythm of international football in South America is different to that in Europe. In Europe there are qualifiers for the World Cup, then the tournament itself, then qualifiers for the Euros, then the tournament itself, then the cycle begins again. In South America there are World Cup qualifiers – a gruelling 18-game marathon – then the tournament itself and then for a year there’s nothing, just friendlies before the same 10 teams who will meet in the World Cup qualifiers are joined by two guests – Mexico and Jamaica this year – for the Copa América. It comes only a year after the World Cup and tight on the end of the European season – five days after the Champions League final in this case – and the result is that teams often arrive at the Copa América under prepared. There is a frisson to the opening games as the favourites, starved of competitive football for a year, seek the balance and edge a qualifying series might have given them. Four years ago Argentina sleepwalked into the Copa América it was hosting, distracted by the ramifications of River Plate’s unexpected relegation and by the insistence of Sergio Batista, then the coach, that his side could play like Barcelona. They couldn’t, drew with Bolivia and Colombia, beat Costa Rica, and then went out on penalties to Uruguay in the quarter-final, despite having a man advantage for 48 minutes. Martino is determined that won’t happen again, which is why he has overlooked the claims of the likes of Palermo’s Paulo Dybala, Internazionale’s Mauro Icardi and Villarreal’s Luciano Vietto, all forwards who have been in fine form this season, preferring to stick with those who got Argentina to the World Cup finals. The time for experimentation, Martino has said, comes after the Copa América – although the schedule is complicated by the special centenary Copa América to be contested in the US in 2016, with all 10 Conmebol sides and six teams from Concacaf. Not that Argentina are short of forwards, with Carlos Tevez returning from exile to join Lionel Messi, who is fit, despite rumours he would be ruled out with a foot injury, Gonzalo Higuaín, Sergio Agüero and Ezequiel Lavezzi in the squad. Tevez, Higuaín and Agüero, Martino has said, will all be given game time over the two friendlies, his implication being that he will stick with the 4-3-3 shape he has preferred so far, with a central forward flanked by Messi and Ángel Di María. There is the option of playing Di María deeper, as one of the three midfielders, as Sabella did at the World Cup, or of bringing in Javier Pastore and playing a 4-2-3-1 as Argentina did in their defeat by Portugal last November but Martino has tended towards caution. The glut of high-class attacking players in the Argentina squad means, paradoxically, that fewer of them can be picked. Deficiencies in defensive areas mean Martino prefers the blunt solidity of seven largely defensive players to provide a platform for his rotating cast of three stars. Javier Mascherano’s place at the back of midfield is certain but elsewhere there are places in the Copa América starting lineup to be earned. Martino has spoken of his admiration for Valencia’s Enzo Pérez but he is out injured, leaving Lucas Biglia and Ever Banega as the two most likely players to flank Mascherano. The situation is no clearer at the back. Martín Demichelis, Santiago Vergini and Federico Fazio have been left out of the squad, opening the door for Mateo Musacchio of Villarreal to come in alongside Ezequiel Garay in the centre of defence and perhaps add some much-needed pace to the back four. Martino needs solutions soon. The clock is ticking; after these two matches Argentina have only one friendly scheduled – against Bolivia on 6 June, when they may be missing players to the Champions League final – before they begin their Copa América campaign on 13 June against Paraguay in La Serena.",2015-03-26T15:21:00Z,Can Gerardo Martino end Argentina’s cup drought with Copa América glory?,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""e20dd81e172cbdd88cd41214d4462410d27480bd""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2015/3/25/1427305696953/Gerardo-Martinos-squad-se-005.jpg"" alt=""Gerardo Martino's squad selection for Argentina's friendlies appears conservative"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Gerardo Martino's squad selection for Argentina's friendlies against El Salvador and Ecuador appears conservative.

"  Related: California water restrictions have not stopped the sprinklers from flowing    As his state faces the worst drought in its history, with mandatory water rationing for residents and fears of destruction to the agricultural sector, California governor Jerry Brown had a message Sunday for climate change deniers: wake up. “With the weather that’s happening in California, climate change is not a hoax,” Brown said, on ABC news. “We’re dealing with it, and it’s damn serious.” Snow pack in California this year, which historically has renewed the state’s water reservoirs each spring, has been measured at just 8% of usual levels. Reservoirs sit mostly dry, with 38 million residents downstream wondering where water for showers, dishes and drinking will come from. Earlier this week, Brown announced new rules for the amount of water California residents and municipalities can use, with the aim of cutting statewide water usage by 25%. Residents faced restrictions on watering lawns and flushing toilets. Cities were prohibited from watering ornamental grass on street medians and told to revisit how much water utilities charge. “It is a wake-up call and it should be for everyone,” Brown said on Sunday. “It affects lawns. It affects people’s how long they stay in the shower.” The governor said that if people ignored rationing, which could be measured through local water districts, they could face fines. “The enforcement mechanism is powerful,” Brown said. “In a drought of this magnitude, you have to change behavior.” California senator Dianne Feinstein told CNN, meanwhile, that the historic drought facing her state represented a “very, very serious problem” and announced that she was working on emergency legislation to provide relief to farmers and residents whose livelihoods were threatened.   Related: California farmers resign themselves to drought: 'Nobody's fault but God's'    Brown responded to criticism that the rationing rules did not do enough to limit water consumption by the agricultural sector. About 9m acres of farmland in California are irrigated, accounting for 80% of all human water use, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. High-growth crops include almonds and other nuts, grapes, citrus and other fruit. “The farmers have fallowed hundreds of thousands of acres,” Brown said. “They’re pulling up vines and trees. Farmworkers are out of work. There are people in agriculture areas that are really suffering.” Brown said shutting down agriculture production in the state was possible but “that would displace hundreds of thousands of people, and I don’t think it’s needed.” “If things continue to at this level, that’s probably going to be examined,” he said.",2015-04-05T15:17:40Z,California governor tells climate change deniers to wake up,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""1c3ee6ebc0b5353e9ab5348bf2d40eddc4fa9810""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/1c3ee6ebc0b5353e9ab5348bf2d40eddc4fa9810/0_120_3000_1799/1000.jpg"" alt=""California governor Jerry Brown"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Earlier this week, Brown announced new rules for the amount of water California residents and municipalities can use, with the aim of cutting statewide water usage by 25%.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Randall Benton/ZUMA Press/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>",64,"California senator announces planned measures to help farmers and residents facing threats to their livelihoods amid ‘very, very serious problem’",http://media.guim.co.uk/1c3ee6ebc0b5353e9ab5348bf2d40eddc4fa9810/0_120_3000_1799/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/05/california-governor-drought-climate-change-dianne-feinstein,0,negative
"As California enters year four of one of the most severe droughts in state history, officials on Tuesday welcomed a host of temporary water measures that limits landscape irrigation and restricts how restaurants and hotels use the vital resource.   Related: Drought-stricken California only has one year of water left, Nasa scientist warns    Under the new rules, districts that haven’t already restricted outdoor watering to two days per week are required to do so, restaurants and bars must ask customers if they want a glass of water before automatically serving one, and hotels and motels must offer guests the option to not wash their sheets and towels daily, among other provisions.  Though the new measures are among the most drastic efforts taken by the State Water Resources Control Board to reduce water use, many water conservation groups are disappointed the restrictions did not go further.  “The State Water Board’s extension of the water conservation regulations are a logical and reasonable next step, but this epic drought calls for deeper and permanent reform,” Sara Aminzadeh, executive director of California Coastkeeper Alliance, said in a statement.  Last summer, officials approved emergency measures that prohibited people hosing down sidewalks, driveways and patios, washing cars without a shutoff nozzle and using drinking water in ornamental fountains.    Related: California farmers resign themselves to drought: 'Nobody's fault but God's'    Officials on the board said the growing severity of the drought demanded new action. Days before the vote, Nasa released new data that showed the state has only about one year of water left.  “We are not seeing the stepping up and the ringing of alarm bells that the situation warrants,” Felicia Marcus, chair of the State Water Resources Control Board, said during a meeting in Sacramento, the state capital, on Tuesday. The new measures will first be reviewed by a legal team, and, when approved, will be put into effect for 270 days. Those caught in violation of the measures could face a fine of as much as $500, though critics say enforcement will be difficult. “Local jurisdictions have to implement and enforce these measures to actually reduce water usage,” Liz Crosson, executive director of Los Angeles Waterkeeper, said in a statement. “Many of the State Board’s mandatory measures are still not enforced in Los Angeles. Until Californians take the drought seriously, we will continue to see reserves depleted and the future become more uncertain.” Last year, the board directed the state’s major urban water advisers to implement measures that limited landscape watering. But the response was piecemeal and didn’t have the intended impact.   Related: American drought: California’s crisis    “The way we wrote things this last year, in hindsight, was probably too big of a loophole to leave open,” said Max Gomberg, a senior environmental scientist at the water board, told the Sacramento Bee.  The latest measures are meant to tighten this rule by requiring water agencies to limit landscape watering to certain days. Smaller water agencies would also be allowed to impose new rules that would help minimize usage, but are not required to specify watering days. The move, however, is expected to have little impact on cities in the southern half of the state, where local agencies already have strict restrictions in place. New data released in January shows that the state fell short of the governor’s emergency drought order that called for reducing water use by 20% each month. The data showed that Californians reduced their water usage by just 8.8% in January compared to what they used in January 2013.

"Imagine having two bank accounts with money for your everyday needs, only one of them – the one you draw from when the primary account runs low – is a virtual black box. You really have no idea what the balance is, and there is no record of deposits and withdrawals. This is how water is managed in California, with 38mn people and the world’s eighth largest economy. In years of “normal” precipitation, the semi-arid state gets most of its water supply from winter rain and spring snowmelt. However, when this “primary account” of surface water supply dwindles during droughts, farms and communities rely heavily on a mystery account called groundwater, which truly is out of sight and, unfortunately, out of mind. Few people have information about the underground stores that provide up to 60% of the state’s water supply during droughts, including water to about 600,000 relatively shallow domestic wells, located mostly in rural areas.  State records that provide information needed to characterize groundwater aquifers are kept confidential under a 64-year-old law that considers them proprietary to well drillers. Known as well logs, the records contain data that is public in every other western state – details such as where wells are located, their depth, potential pumping rates, diameter and descriptions of the groundwater-bearing sediments and rocks they are bored through. Because the state’s database of 800,000 well logs is not publicly available, local agencies, consultants, academics and communities looking for safe water supplies must develop their own information in order to develop groundwater models, discover the water quality characteristics of a basin, or determine which wells are likely to go dry. Where local agencies can’t afford it, the costs of this restrictive policy have prevented local basin characterization altogether. Meanwhile, residents reliant on wells are running out of water across the state, from the small farm communities of Orange Center and Easton in the San Joaquin Valley to the foothill communities of the Sierra Nevada. In homes that have run completely out of water, families must use a bucket or a bottle of water to brush their teeth, make coffee, wash dishes, flush a toilet, and even wash their hands. In the Tulare County town of Poplar, which has a population of 2,500, groundwater levels have dropped so much that the community had to draw from a backup well known to be contaminated with high levels of nitrates from agricultural fertilizer. And all too often, neither the well owners nor local water managers have the information they need to protect their wells and predict when and where wells will go dry – as the community of East Porterville discovered last summer when more than 600 wells failed. The lack of information is a major impediment to stewardship of the resource. California wells went dry by the thousands last year and thousands more will follow suit this coming summer, but communities can’t access data about what parts of the groundwater system around them have been tapped, which wells are at risk or what the water quality is. This information is needed to understand how drought and groundwater development impact local water supply and how to respond quickly and effectively. When the state legislature passed historic groundwater legislation last year, it stopped short of changing the law and providing critical information needed for sustainable groundwater management. The lack of transparent well log data is holding back innovation and solutions at a time when they are needed most. Making these records publicly available would incentivize better data management on this important resource and better science to understand both groundwater supply and pollution. At best, the lack of publicly accessible well logs is slowing down progress toward sustainable groundwater management. At worst, it’s thwarting progress entirely. Making well logs accessible would create opportunities to invest in groundwater management projects and public-private partnerships that will develop more effective and cost-efficient solutions for California’s groundwater. Over the last year, the state has spent more than $20 million in emergency drought relief to help communities like East Porterville. Without access to the data and tools necessary to prevent acute drought impacts in the state’s most vulnerable communities, however, the intensified drought will cost the state and local residents far more this coming summer. The California Assembly passed a resolution earlier this month to celebrate “the public’s commitment to openness”. The first line of the resolution reads: “California has a long tradition in support of open government and access to government records”.  Senate Bill 20, introduced by State Senator Fran Pavley in December, would make well log data publicly available in California. Perhaps as more community and farm wells dry up this summer, the legislature will extend its enthusiasm for transparency to the critical information needed for more equitable and sustainable management of our groundwater.",2015-03-27T12:07:34Z,Groundwater records should not be kept confidential in drought-stricken California,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""74a5b13d49ea5cd2d8c85385148c837ff6e6fb76""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/26/1427406691039/d20f6c38-c4c2-47ae-a983-1e03106e6a88-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""water"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">How much water lies beneath the ground?

"California’s drought – which last year is estimated to have cost the state’s agriculture industry $1.5bn and more than 17,000 seasonal jobs – has been met with a drought of ideas from some of the world’s most out-of-the-box thinkers. But while close to $12bn went into just internet startups last year – even as analysts talk about another emerging internet bubble – only few hundred million dollars are traditionally invested in water startups every year. In 2014, among the 60 deals that were done in water, as tracked by the Cleantech Group’s i3 research, there was funding for a company called Axine Water Technologies that makes a cell (with electrodes like a battery) that can clean waste water for the chemical or oil and gas industries. Another startup that found rare funding last year was MemTech, which makes low-cost, ultra-filtration membranes that clean wastewater.   Related: California's drought is not getting better but experts look to startups for ideas    But none of those companies have the profiles (or money from) California residents Mark Zuckerberg, Peter Thiel or Tim Cook; none of them have half the hype of pie-in-sky Hyperloop – the crazy transportation idea that has the attention of multiple competing startups – self-driving cars or apps of the day like Meerkat. The problem is, according to water industry leaders, that there’s no value in saving water unless society starts placing a value on water. Water is a commodity in many places, often free or priced at a bare-bones cost, so it’s difficult to build businesses around something that isn’t valued. At a summit focused on water innovation in the face of the drought last September in Berkeley, California, water execs called this problem “the misaligned price of water”. The business of delivering cleaner and more efficient water is tough. And in contrast, the barrier to building, say, the next-photo sharing mobile app or connected device, is lower than it’s ever been. The time and money it takes to commercialize more science-dependent water tech innovations – like new membranes for water desalination – is far greater than it is for commercializing internet technologies. “An investor that puts money into dotcom companies can get a return on that investment in three to five years, while for a water tech company it could be over a decade,” said James Fotouhi, a research analyst at BlueTech Research, a firm focused on intelligence for the water industry. The same difficulties have plagued many Silicon Valley energy startups over the years, including many of the companies that tried to manufacture the next-generation of thin, flexible solar panels. And solving California’s drought – and helping to better manage global water resources in an increasingly water-constrained world – isn’t necessarily a problem that needs to be solved by new technology. Other regions around the world like Israel are already successfully using (and exporting) available water conservation and cleaning technologies. As David Sedlak, co-director of Berkeley Water Center, told the tech news site Re/code last year: “Solving the problem of water supply over the next 10 or 20 years is going to rely on technologies that are here and mature now.”  There’s no reason to wait to deploy future disruptive water innovations, when there’s current water tech that just needs financing and maybe the right business model to deploy now.  Israel reuses about 80% of its municipal wastewater, mostly for irrigation, and plants are using activated sludge (circulated micro organisms), membrane filtration and stabilization ponds, among other methods. Israel is also aggressively using conventional reverse osmosis desalination tech to clean seawater and is now a world leader for desalination. From a startup perspective, one area that is ripe for new ideas and entrepreneurs is helping bring the world’s water infrastructure into the digital age and making it much more efficient, similar to what is now happening with the power grid. At a conference in San Francisco last week, startups like Lagoon, Valor Water Analytics, and Fathom, showed off algorithm and data-driven water products for companies and water utilities. The majority of California’s (as well as the world’s) water use goes to agriculture – not to water used by cities, industries or the water-intensive energy industry. And agriculture is actually one area where Silicon Valley is starting to pay a lot more attention recently. Investors call this sector “precision agriculture” and it’s focused on using the latest computing technologies – from robotics, to big data tools, to drones to sensors – to help farmers deliver crops with less energy, water and fertilizer. The large tech industries in the area can also just help by starting to make the same types of aggressive pledges to water conservation and reuse that they’ve started to do with issues like clean power. Google, Apple and Facebook have all made aggressive pledges to adopt large amounts of clean energy to power their data centers, despite the early nature and sometimes higher cost of these goals. Google has experimented with using recycled wastewater to cool a data center in Georgia, and seawater for a data center in Finland.",2015-03-27T12:00:07Z,The California drought is a problem Silicon Valley isn't helping to solve,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""d371ee4cfbec6ec53631a48ef20f03c4a6eeafe7""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/26/1427400771035/291a7b74-03dc-40ff-8175-0a00201cf674-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""A sign indicating that recycled water is used to water plants is seen in Burbank, Los Angeles, California March 19, 2015.

" At the moment they are whippy saplings needing the support of canes to stand straight. Over hundreds – and hopefully thousands – of years, they will soar high into the Cornish sky.   Clones of some of the oldest and biggest coast redwoods have been flown in from the western seaboard of the USA to the Eden Project in the far south-west of Britain as part of a hugely ambitious scheme to preserve the magnificent trees for future generations.      Tim Grigg of the Eden Project prunes the coast redwood saplings. Photograph: Emily Whitfield-Wicks/Eden Project    Coast redwoods are the tallest living things on Earth, growing to 115 metres in height. But almost all have been cut down over the last 150 years and the remaining specimens are under threat in their west coast home because of drought, forest fire and the decline of the foggy, sometimes chilly, conditions they thrive in.  Experts from the Archangel Ancient Tree Archive, based in Michigan, have sent climbers to the top of the forest giants to take cuttings from the fastest growing shoots, and collected sprouts from the stumps of felled trees. New saplings have been cloned from these samples and sent to Cornwall.   The batch of redwoods delivered to Eden’s nursery comprises 10 specimens each of 10 remarkable trees, including the Fieldbrook stump, the remains of a famous northern Californian redwood felled in 1890 when it was around 3,500 years old.     Children on the Fieldbrook stump, date unknown. Photograph: Ericson Collection, Humboldt State University Library     If it had not been cut down it would probably be the world’s largest tree by now. It left a stump more than 10 metres in diameter, wider than any other known single trunk. Material was taken from shoots that grew from the stump, to clone the new saplings.  David Milarch, co-founder of the AATA, described the project as “assisted migration” and said the arrival of the trees in Europe and at Eden was a historic moment.  “This will enable the formation of Europe’s first old-growth redwood forest,” he said. “Conditions in Cornwall and at Eden are perfect for redwoods, which help fight climate change by storing vast amounts of carbon. This new plantation will be a library of the tallest, oldest living things on earth.”      Biomes at the Eden Project in Cornwall. Photograph: Alan Copson/JAI/Corbis     Little by little, the aim of the AATA is to reforest the world and help battle climate change. “We’re doing this for our grandchildren. They deserve better than they are lined up to get,” said Milarch.   Each of the specimens that the AATA propagated are cloned from a single tree. This means that the resulting offspring are a full genetic match to the original whereas a specimen grown from a seed will have half of the DNA of each parent.  Sir Tim Smit, executive vice-chairman of the Eden Project, said the trees would be planted near the site’s northern boundary. “The idea is that when they grow they will be seen for miles around and become a new landmark. Planting saplings which could exceed the height of a 30-storey building and live for 4,000 years requires a different kind of planning.”      Grigg tending the coast redwood saplings. Photograph: Emily Whitfield-Wicks/Eden Project     Inspired by the success of Archangel in propagating the ancient trees, Eden is planning a UK-wide ancient tree-cloning project. The UK has more ancient trees than the rest of northern Europe put together, with over 130,000 already mapped. Eden plans to follow the same model as AATA, cloning ancient trees and using them for reforestation.   Smit pointed out that the Eden project will not – in all probability – exist by the time the redwoods have reached full maturity. If its conservation goals are met, the place will be redundant; if they have failed then there may not be much left of the world as we know it.

"Kim Hammond does not want responsibility for her neighbours’ livelihoods, or for the crops which stretch in all directions as far as the eye can see, or for the earth itself in this corner of California.  But these days, her little bungalow office in the yard of her family’s drilling company can feel like Mount Olympus. “It’s just way too stressful, playing God,” said Hammond, a grandmother who co-owns the company and works as its secretary. “Every day we have people on the phone or here in person, pleading. It breaks your heart. But I always give it to them straight. I don’t sugarcoat it.” It is her job to tell farmers when – or if – a team can visit their property to drill for groundwater and make a well which can save a crop, avert bankruptcy and, perhaps, preserve a way of life.  As California faces a likely fourth year of drought, demand for drilling in the Central Valley has exploded. Hammond’s company, Arthur &amp; Orum, can barely keep up: its seven rigs are working flat-out, yet a white folder with pending requests is thicker than three telephone books.  The waiting list has grown to three years, leaving many farmers to contemplate parched fields and ruin in what has been one of the world’s most productive agricultural regions. It supplies half of America’s fruit, nuts and vegetables. “We’re overwhelmed. We’re going crazy,” said Hammond. “Everyone is in a desperate situation. Everyone has a sad story.” Arthur &amp; Orum has bought an additional rig for $1.2m, and out-of-state drillers have moved into the area. But as drills criss-cross the landscape, boring ever deeper into the earth, there is a haunting fear: what if they suck up all the groundwater? What if, one day, the water runs out? “We’re having to go deeper and deeper,” said Hammond. “They say we’re tapping water millions of years old. That boggles the mind. I can hardly grasp it.”  Meagre rain has depressed the water table so much that in some areas drills bore more than 1,500ft. Sucking up water stored long underground can cause soil to subside and collapse. In some places the land has dropped by a foot. Hydrogeologists have warned that pumping out groundwater faster than it can recharge threatens springs, streams and ecosystems.  Hammond said she was conflicted that the family business was saving some neighbours’ livelihoods for now but risked long-term devastation. “They say we’re cutting our own throats. I live here. I don’t want to live in the desert.” Sensing drama, a reality TV production company has asked the family company about doing a show. Desperate times The spectre of desertification inched closer this week. The Sierra Nevada snowpack, which supplies about a third of California’s water, is paltry. The California Cooperative Snow Surveys Program found just 6.7in of snow – close to the lowest on record – at a survey spot near Echo Summit. Storms in December and February mean reservoirs hold more water than this time last year, but they remain well below average. Conservation efforts are slipping. In January urban areas used 9% less water than January 2013, far below the official target of 20%.  El Niño, the weather system which often douses the western US, has returned after a five-year absence but promises little relief. Mike Halpert, deputy director of the Climate Prediction Center, said in a statement it is “likely too late and too weak to provide much relief for drought-stricken California”. Federal officials warned last week that for a second consecutive year irrigation projects were likely to allocate zero water to Central Valley farmers without senior water rights. “This is an absolutely devastating shock,” said Ryan Jacobsen, executive director for the Fresno County farm bureau. “Unless things change dramatically in the next six weeks, we expect 2015 to be much worse than last year.” Crisis is apparent as you drive through the valley. Many fields are fallow – some idled last year, others more recently. The earth is baked hard. Preliminary estimates suggest Fresno may have recorded its warmest-ever February, prolonging what has been dubbed the “time without winter”. Roadside signs warn of the consequences. “No water = no food.” “Food grows where water flows.” The American Meteorological Society has found no definitive link between climate change and California’s drought, but a recent report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences said rising temperatures caused dry periods to overlap more often with warm periods. ‘It’s like frigging chemotherapy’ Computers and state-of-the-art irrigation have not spared Shawn Coburn, 46, who owns a farm near Dos Palos, in Merced County. Last year he abandoned alfalfa and pomegranates and cut his 1,000-acre tomato crop by two-thirds. “This year I’ll fallow all of it. You’ll see a lot more land fallowed this year.” Like many farmers, he assailed pumping restrictions aimed at protecting the delta smelt, a threatened fish, and other environmental regulations, branding them ruinous and futile. Environmentalists call them vital to the entire ecosystem. Coburn has spent almost $4m on wells but said in some areas water plumbed from ever lower depths was often laden with salt and other minerals. “It’s like frigging chemotherapy,” he said. “You can get away with it for one year. By the third year you’re basically killing the tree.” Even so, many farmers see no alternative.      Clarence Freitas. Photograph: Rory Carroll for the Guardian    Clarence Freitas, 56, who owns 70 acres of almonds and grapes, watched with relief as a team from Arthur &amp; Orum drilled into his baked soil, boring through 80ft a day until reaching 440ft and an expensive, urgent replacement for his old 160ft-deep well.  “My heart hurts, my bank account hurts,” he said, as muddy water gushed from pipes. Neighbours advised him to go deeper, in anticipation of the water table plunging further, but Freitas said the men in his family tended to die young – “I hope it’ll last 20 years and by then I’ll be gone.” He was not optimistic about the valley. “This could go back to being desert, the way it was before irrigation.” Many farmers are descendants of migrants who fled here to escape the 1930s dust bowl, a trauma immortalised in John Steinbeck’s novel The Grapes of Wrath. It could happen again, except this time in California’s man-made Eden, said Matt Hammond, 51, Kim’s husband, on his way to a drilling site.  “They’ll keep growing crops around here until they pump the valley dry. If something doesn’t change, everything will dry up and die. It won’t be farmable anymore.” The community had hoped for a “miracle March” of bountiful rain but that seems unlikely, he said, scanning azure skies. “Nobody’s fault but God’s.”",2015-03-07T13:00:04Z,California farmers resign themselves to drought: 'Nobody's fault but God's',"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""19b13026fa8f4fcd334a457fe9500e9ef39634b7""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/6/1425670154775/3cfe79c8-dec1-4cc1-9e5f-c1adc5a10bd1-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Fresno drought"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Baked earth at Clarence Freitas’ farm, outside Fresno.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Rory Carroll/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>",70,"Despite efforts to dig deeper into the earth to get at diminishing groundwater, the spectre of desertification may cost Central Valley farmers too much to carry on",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/6/1425670155111/79b07f18-0fe7-4c74-8d36-97920c0ad815-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/07/california-drought-farmers-drilling-groundwater-environment,4,negative
"A rapidly advancing storm system affected southern California earlier this week, bringing more than an inch of rain, and prompting warnings of mudslides and flash flooding. Winter thunderstorms are not uncommon in California but these particular storm cells created the unusual sight of beaches and palm trees smothered 20-30mm deep in hailstones. A waterspout, in essence a tornado that forms over open water, was also spotted just off the coast of Santa Monica. The same winter storm left more than a foot of snow in Californian ski resorts, including Bear Mountain, and other south-western states such as Arizona and Utah, also saw large snowfalls. Extreme heat continues to roast western Queensland in Australia, worsening drought conditions across large areas. Temperatures have exceeded 40C, several degrees above the seasonal norm, for days on end – 16 consecutive days in the small town of Boulia in the Queensland outback, peaking at 44C, although temperatures exceeded 37C every day in February. Worryingly, this region is in the midst of its climatological wet season with only a few weeks until the official dry season commences. Reservoirs are at record lows with very little farmland grazing remaining, promoting concern for the rest of the year’s agricultural industry.

"  Related: California farmers resign themselves to drought: 'Nobody's fault but God's'    As California experiences the fourth year of one of the most severe droughts in its history, a senior Nasa scientist has warned that the state has about one year of water left. In an LA Times editorial published last week, Nasa Jet Propulsion Laboratory senior water cycle scientist Jay Famiglietti called for a more “forward-looking process” to deal with the state’s dwindling water supply. Famiglietti, who is also a professor at University of California at Irvine, said the state had about one year of water in reservoir storage and the backup supply, groundwater, was low. “California has no contingency plan for a persistent drought like this one (let alone a 20-plus-year mega-drought), except, apparently, staying in emergency mode and praying for rain,” Famiglietti wrote. “In short, we have no paddle to navigate this crisis.” Nasa data shows that water storage has been in steady decline in California since at least 2002, before the drought began. Famiglietti called for specific measures to combat the crisis, including accelerated implementation of a law that requires groundwater sustainability, a state taskforce focused on long-term solutions and immediate, mandatory rationing. He also said there was a need for the public to be more involved in the issue. A Field poll released in February showed that 34% of California voters supported a mandatory rationing policy, though 94% agreed that the drought is “serious”. The majority of respondents – 61% – favored the voluntary reductions the state currently encourages.   Keep it in the ground petition   On Tuesday, the State Water Resources Control Board is scheduled to vote on a conservation measure that would limit landscape watering, the strictest mandate directed at such water use the state has considered. “Our state’s water management is complex, but the technology and expertise exist to handle this harrowing future,” Famiglietti said. “It will require major changes in policy and infrastructure that could take decades to identify and act upon. Today, not tomorrow, is the time to begin.” Scientists are working to determine what role climate change has played in California’s drought. Earlier this month, a study by Stanford researchers showed that high temperatures increase the risk of drought conditions. Last year, two research teams said in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society that they could not definitively pin the drought on climate change.

"The prolonged and devastating drought that sparked the mass migration of rural workers into Syrian cities before the 2011 uprising was probably made worse by greenhouse gas emissions, US scientists say. The study is one of the first to implicate global warming from human activities as one of the factors that played into the Syrian conflict which is estimated to have claimed more than 190,000 lives. The severity of the 2006 to 2010 drought, and more importantly the failure of Bashar al-Assad’s regime to prepare, or respond to it effectively, exacerbated other tensions, from unemployment to corruption and inequality, which erupted in the wake of the Arab spring revolutions, the scientists say.  “We’re not arguing that the drought, or even human-induced climate change, caused the uprising,” said Colin Kelley at the University of California in Santa Barbara. “What we are saying is that the long term trend, of less rainfall and warmer temperatures in the region, was a contributing factor, because it made the drought so much more severe.”  From 2006, the Fertile Crescent, where farming was born 12,000 years ago, faced the worst three year drought in the instrumental record. Unsustainable agricultural policies meant that the drought led to the broad collapse of farming in northeastern Syria. Their livelihoods gone, an estimated one to 1.5 million people surged into the cities. The arrival of so many rural families came on the heels of a million Iraqi refugees who arrived after 2006, causing what Kelley refers to as a “huge population shock” in Syria’s most affected urban centres. Many of the displaced settled on the edges of cities, where already tough living conditions were made more challenging by poor access to water and electricity. Writing in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Kelley describes how the unsustainable farming practices in Syria led to a massive depletion of groundwater which was crucial for irrigating land beyond the reaches of the rivers.  But the dwindling groundwater was accompanied by a long term decline in rainfall in the region that affected farms watered from rivers. According to records Kelley studied, the Fertile Crescent, including Syria, witnessed a 13% drop in its winter rainfall since 1931. Another trend saw summer temperatures rising, which dried out much of the remaining moisture in the soils. To explore the causes of the drought, the US scientists turned to climate change models. They found that the models predicted the drier and warmer trend for Syria, but only when they included human greenhouse gas emissions. The trend made such a severe drought in Syria more than twice as likely, they report. “There’s a strong argument to be made that the long term trend contributed to this drought and was the reason it was the most severe drought they have ever had,” Kelley said. The theory has not convinced everyone though. Francesca de Châtel at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, points out that rural communities had been left disenfranchised and disaffected from 50 years of policies that exploited and mismanaged Syrian resources.  In the journal Middle Eastern Studies last year, she wrote that the government’s failure to respond to the drought crisis was only one of the triggers of the protests that started in March 2011, along with a host of other political, economic and social grievances. “The uprising has more to do with the government’s failure to respond to the drought, and with broader feelings of discontent in rural areas, and the growing gap between rich and poor, and urban and rural areas during the 2000s, than with the drought itself,” she told the Guardian. “I don’t think the uprising would have started in Syria if other countries in the region hadn’t set the example,” she added. “I also don’t think the movement would have persisted without input and support from organised groups in Syria who had been planning for this moment for years and certainly since before 2006 or the start of the drought.”  The US researchers agree that civil unrest never has a simple or unique cause, and that the civil war in Syria is no exception. But they warn that global warming is predicted to bring more severe climate events, and that some could hit countries where they could spark unrest. Kelley’s latest work suggests that Yemen could face its own problems with reduced rainfall in coming years. “This is an example of the emergence of climate change beginning to influence countries in a negative way. And if it continues, we’ll see more examples of that in the future,” he said.",2015-03-02T20:00:08Z,"Global warming contributed to Syria's 2011 uprising, scientists claim","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""8202074e27384438d53fb0915dc5b3d1ff499073""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/8202074e27384438d53fb0915dc5b3d1ff499073/0_196_2000_1200/1000.jpg"" alt=""Syrians pray for rain in Damascus"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Syrians prayed for rain in Damascus after Bashar al-Assad called for citizens to make their personal pleas. </span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Youssef Badawi/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>",73,US study claims regime’s unsustainable agricultural policies meant drought led to collapse of farming in north-eastern region and triggered mass migration to cities and added to feelings of discontent,http://media.guim.co.uk/8202074e27384438d53fb0915dc5b3d1ff499073/0_196_2000_1200/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/02/global-warming-worsened-syria-drought-study,6,negative
"California is in the midst of its worst drought in over 1,200 years, exacerbated by record hot temperatures. A new study led by Benjamin Cook at Nasa GISS examines how drought intensity in North America will change in a hotter world, and finds that things will only get worse. Global warming intensifies drought in several ways. In increases evaporation from soil and reservoirs. In increases water demand. It makes precipitation fall more as rain and less as snow, which is problematic for regions like California that rely on snowpack melt to refill reservoirs throughout the year. It also makes the snowpack melt earlier in the year. The record heat has intensified the current California drought by about 36%, and the planet will only continue to get hotter.         NASA scientists used tree rings to understand past droughts and climate models incorporating soil moisture data to estimate future drought risk in the 21st century.    The study finds that drought intensity will increase, but could be manageable if we follow a path that involves slowing global warming by cutting carbon pollution.     Soil moisture 30 cm below ground projected through 2100 for scenario RCP 4.5, which involves action to reduce carbon pollution. Brown is drier and blue is wetter than the 20th century average. Source: NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center    However, decades-long mega-droughts in North America could be much worse than those experienced during medieval times, which led to the decline of native populations, if we continue on our current business-as-usual path.     Soil moisture 30 cm below ground projected through 2100 for scenario RCP 8.5, which involves business-as-usual high levels of carbon pollution. Brown is drier and blue is wetter than the 20th century average. Source: NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center    Jason Smerdon, a co-author and climate scientist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, described the implications of the study in stark terms,  The 21st-century projections make the [previous] mega-droughts seem like quaint walks through the garden of Eden   The mega-droughts are projected to hit the main agricultural regions in the United States – both California and the Midwest “breadbasket.” The chronic water shortages that are anticipated in these regions under the business-as-usual scenario would make farming, as well as ranching in the American southwest, nearly impossible. This study reveals the flaw that underlies the ‘CO2 is plant food’ myth. While some types of plants benefit from a high-CO2 environment in a greenhouse where we can control all other variables, in the global climate, carbon pollution has other consequences. Among these are higher temperatures and more intense droughts, which are not good for plants or agriculture. It’s another example of the risks we face in a hotter world. This is an important time in human history, where we’re at a fork in the road. If we follow the business-as-usual path, we move towards a future with extremely disruptive climate consequences, like mega-droughts and water shortages in major agricultural regions. If we follow the path to cut carbon pollution, we significantly reduce the risks of disruptive climate change.",2015-02-16T14:00:04Z,Nasa climate study warns of unprecedented North American drought,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""74a5b13d49ea5cd2d8c85385148c837ff6e6fb76""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/14/1423939541398/2d2193f2-dea5-4839-970c-93ba6c6314f9-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""A section of Lake Oroville in California is seen nearly dry on August 19, 2014 in Oroville, California.

"Severe drought and an ailing economy have forced cities and towns across Brazil to abandon or scale back their plans for Carnival, which is due to start on Friday. In Brasília, the capital, the local authorities have cancelled the samba school parade for the first time since 1983, in an attempt to plug the R$4bn (£900m) hole left in the accounts by the previous administration. “It was a really unpleasant surprise,” said Geomar Leite, the president of Brasília’s Union of Samba Schools, said. “We had all the programme ready; the music, the costumes. We feel really frustrated.”   Related: Brazil’s worst drought in history prompts protests and blackouts    Even the world-famous Carnival of Rio de Janeiro is not immune. The state oil company, Petrobras, though mired in a massive corruption scandal, has promised to continue its funding of the main samba schools. But this year’s street parties, known as blocos, which rely on private-sector funding, will be more modest affairs. Rita Fernandes, the president of Sebastiana, an association representing street parties in Rio’s wealthy southern zone, said there had been a massive reduction in the interest of sponsors this year. “We have suffered a lot. Normally brands are desperate to be associated with us. This year that didn’t happen.” As a result, the organisation has had to cancel two dance events. Elsewhere in Brazil, the shortage of water is the main problem. The south-east is experiencing its worst drought in 80 years, and its two most populous states, São Paulo and Minas Gerais, have seen the biggest cutbacks, with 10 towns cancelling celebrations. In the town of Cordeirópolis, whose water supply has come from a mining pit for the past three months, the council issued a statement arguing that using water to clean up after the party would be “even more controversial” than cancelling. In Itapecerica residents have been without running water for up to five days each week. Although supply has now been restored, Welliton Cruz, the town’s tourism secretary, said the decision to cancel came after the local utility company said it could not guarantee water to the thousands of tourists that usually visit each Carnival.     A former resident of the re-emerging old city of the Igarata. The ruins of a sunken town which had remained underwater since 1969 have re-emerged, as parts of Brazil grapple with the country’s worst drought in 80 years.  Photograph: Nacho Doce/Reuters    “The town approved of the decision,” he said. “Even though there will be a negative economic impact for the bars, the hotels and the transport sector.” In the city of São Paulo, three hundred blocos, attracting an estimated two million, have been registered with the authorities. But with many receiving no running water for several hours each day, some question whether the city can cope. Flávio Pires, the president of the Association of Gastronomy, Entertainment, Art and Culture in Vila Madalena, a fashionable district in western São Paulo, said his members were worried. “The bars don’t even have water in their toilets at night. We are having to use buckets,” he said. The mayor’s office has announced that street cleaners will use untreated water to wash the streets afterwards. In the sambadrome, where tens of thousands gather to watch the samba schools parade, water pressure to the bathrooms has been reduced fivefold to avoid wastage. With water rationing in effect in some places, Brazilians have been stockpiling water. But improperly covered water tanks are a fertile breeding ground for mosquitoes. Nationwide, cases of dengue fever were up 57% year-on-year this January. Now some local authorities have chosen to spend cash earmarked for street parties on disease control. Catanduva, a town 250 miles north of São Paulo, usually attracts 100,000 visitors to its Carnival. This year, however, a mass-spraying programme will replace the street parties.",2015-02-11T16:44:40Z,Brazil scales back Carnival festivities as drought and weak economy persist,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""8779fa552cf88d6208f23ab57e6b3a1a800839a5""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/11/1423676482147/0ed1266e-64a0-405e-86fa-5ad5180e0db5-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Revellers participate in the 'Cordao do Boitata' pre-carnival parade in downtown old Rio de Janeiro."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Revellers participate in the ‘Cordao do Boitata’ pre-carnival parade in downtown old Rio de Janeiro.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Marcelo Sayao/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>",75,Shortage of water and funds has cities and towns across the country cancelling or hedging plans – even for the world-famous Carnival of Rio,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/11/1423676482536/0ed1266e-64a0-405e-86fa-5ad5180e0db5-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/11/brazilian-cities-scale-back-carnival-drought-economy,3,negative
"It should be the rainy season. Instead Sao Paulo state is experiencing a third consecutive year with soaring temperatures and rainfall patterns well below historic records.  The main water reservoirs are operating at their lowest capacity. The Cantareira reservoir system, which serves more than nine million people in the state, is only 5% full. At the Alto Tietê reservoir network, which supplies three million people in greater Sao Paulo, water levels are below 15%.  Simple calculations indicate that given the current level of consumption versus the predicted raining patterns there is only enough water on the system to last four to six months. That means the water could run out before the next rainy season starts in November. State officials recently announced a potential rationing program of five days without water and two days with, in case the February and March rains do not refill the reservoirs. This extreme climate scenario, combined with a series of management flaws, political negligence and a culture of waste and pollution, is bringing the largest metropolitan region of Brazil to the brink of collapse.  Since 2013, after decades of warnings about misguided development policies and destructive land use practices, experts and civil society organisations have been calling for increasingly strong measures to reduce water consumption to keep the minimum secure levels for supply reservoirs. The calls have been ignored by the state government – the system’s main operator – and federal and municipal authorities turned a blind eye to the severity of the situation.   Related: Desperately seeking solutions to worst drought in decades in Brazil    The government took a few small steps in early 2014, such as offering a discount on water bills for people who voluntarily reduced their consumption. It also increased supply from the Billings and Guarapiranga reservoirs, but as these sources receive most of the urban waste from Sao Paulo, the water needs to be carefully tested and treated to be adequate for human consumption, adding to the complexity of securing safe water supply during the drought.  The government’s main initiative has been to reduce pressure on the distribution network, so that it pumps less water through the system. As the measure was not officially recognised by leaders or the media, people were unprepared to live without drinkable water for a couple of days when the supply glitches started to happen. Taken by the population as a de facto rationing, the lack of transparency about the times and places affected by pressure reduction caused more problems and increased distrust among Sao Paulo’s citizens.     The Cantareira reservoir system serving more than nine million people in Sau Paulo state is only 5% full. Photograph: Nacho Cubero/Reuters    The recovery measures adopted so far account for a 22% reduction on the water volume extracted from reservoirs. Experts, however, advise that the reduction should be around 50% to sustain the minimal conditions needed for the system.  Many might be surprised that such a scenario is happening in a tropical country famous for its abundance of natural resources, crossed by hundreds of rivers and with plenty of underground water. But for regional environmentalists and experts it comes as no surprise. They have been raising the alarm on water pollution and campaigning for watershed protection and safety standards since the 1980s. But scientific and technical reports, advocacy measures and pressures on companies were lost among the apparently unstoppable powers of real estate, agriculture and industry development. Urban land use, extensive monocultures and illegal occupation of watersheds have damaged and polluted the water production areas, jeopardising their capacity to survive and recover from extended dry seasons.   Related: Flooding in Nepal: will the economy survive the deluge?    National development policies strongly focus on macro-infrastructure plans such as large hydrodams, ports and roads, the expansion of agribusiness into the Amazon, and the predatory mining industry. These sustain the exports of soya, beef and pig iron while being responsible for the majority of Brazilian greenhouse gas emissions. More and more scientific studies show the link between deforestation in the north and the reduction of rainfall in the southeast, presenting further evidence of how the effects of climate change are already upon us. Despite the relative gains in poverty reduction over the last decade, the imminent collapse of the water supply system of the richest region in Brazil shows that basic development structures have yet to be addressed and fundamental human rights have yet to be secured in this country. Millions of people from the poorest communities have entered the consumer market, but their access to housing, sanitation, clean water, citizen security and transport remain unguarded.      A sign reading ‘Don’t jump in the water’ at the dried up part of the Guarapiranga reservoir in November 2014. Photograph: Paulo Whitaker/Reuters    This is where an old cliché becomes real: major opportunities lie within this crisis. The transcending effect of the water shortage creates a space for unity and coordination among Brazilian social movements. It offers the chance for environmental organisations to link deforestation with urban issues, to communicate that social justice will not be achieved as long as the priority is given to an unequal and unsustainable development model. Moreover, the urgency and scale of the water crisis is likely to bring NGOs and labour unions closer to the organic and youth protests that drew hundreds of thousands of people to the streets in 2013. The time and place for a solid narrative that links poverty reduction to ecological protection seems finally to have arrived. In October 2014, more than 40 NGOs, experts, independent collectives and social movements joined forces to launch the Alliance for Water, a network that is monitoring the government’s response to the crisis and presenting positive solutions for surviving the probable collapse. The alliance aims to collaborate to build a new culture of water use and conservation in Sao Paulo and is producing a series of technical reports and events to qualify the debate among a wide range stakeholders, from specialists to politicians to social movements and grassroots groups.    Related: Why isn't Brazil exploiting its amazing wind capacity?    Today more than 13 million inhabitants of Sao Paulo state find themselves on the edge of an unprecedented public calamity. The absence of political leadership and government transparency fuels panic and fear. Until now, the government has not outlined a clear emergency plan to guarantee minimum water supplies for essential services such as hospitals, police stations and prisons, and for the poorest people who have no structure to store or buy mineral water. A chaotic scenario might take place where, faced with a severe and sustained lack of water, many communities will resort to polluted sources or even violence, raising significant concerns over safety and health. Civil society has a pivotal role to play by challenging development models, establishing social control over emergency plans, securing human rights and promoting the values of ethics and solidarity. As is usual in calamity situations, the most vulnerable, poorest communities are likely to pay the highest price with their health and their dignity. These people need to know they can count on organised civil society to support them across the turbulent times that lie ahead.

"The taps have run dry and the lights have gone out across swathes of Brazil this week as the worst drought in history spreads from São Paulo to Rio de Janeiro and beyond. More than four million people have been affected by rationing and rolling power cuts as this tropical nation discovers it can no longer rely on once abundant water supplies in a period of rising temperatures and diminishing rainfall. The political and economic fallout for the world’s seventh biggest economy is increasingly apparent. Protesters in dry neighbourhoods have taken to the streets, coffee crops have been hit, businesses have been forced to close and peddle-boat operators have had to cease operations because lakes have dried up. In São Paulo – the most populous city in South America and the worst hit by the drought – a year of shortages has cut water use in the city by a quarter since last January, but Jerson Kelman, the head of the main water company Sabesp, urged consumers to do more in helping the utility to “prepare for the worst”.     ‘Welcome to the Cantareira desert’ is written on a car which was once submerged in water, at the Atibainha dam, part of the Cantareira reservoir. Photograph: EPA    “There is a significant part of the population that is not yet aware of the seriousness of the situation and refuses to change habits,” he wrote in an op-ed published on Thursday. “They must be convinced to change their behaviour.” If the dry spell continues, he warned full-scale rationing would be introduced – something the city government denied would be necessary during last year’s elections. At least six cities have been hit by blackouts due to weak hydroelectricity generation and high demand for air conditioning as temperatures soar over 35C. In response, utilities are burning more fossil fuels, adding to the cost of energy and greenhouse gas emissions. The government acknowledged on Thursday that Brazil is also now importing power from Argentina to try to cover the shortfall. In São Paulo, subway trains on one line had to be halted for more than a hour. Lights and internet have also been cut in some areas for days, causing substantial inconvenience to residents and hefty losses to businesses.     Brazilian waitress Elisabeth de Souza looks out from a patio at low levels of water, in Nazare Paulista city. Seventeen of Brazil’s 18 biggest reservoirs are at lower levels than during the last water crisis in 2001. Photograph: EPA    Agriculture is suffering with international impacts. Production of arabica coffee beans – a commodity that Brazil supplies in far greater bulk than any other country – fell 15% last year pushing up the global price of the commodity by almost half. Growers in Minas Gerais said rainfall was just 900 millimetres last year, about half its usual level. As coffee has a two-year growing cycle, the impacts will be felt next year too even if the rains return. Sugar and ethanol output has also been hit. Last week, Raizen, the country’s biggest producer, announced it will lay off 250 workers and cease production at its Bom Retiro mill for two years because of cane shortages caused by the drought. Seventeen of the country’s 18 biggest reservoirs are at lower levels than during the last water crisis in 2001. The southeast is worst affected. “The region has seen alarming reservoir levels since January 2014. Now in 2015, the levels are very worrying, It’s a critical situation,” Paulo Canedo, a water management specialist at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, said. Although the authorities hope for relief from the skies, the current rainy season has only added to concerns. In the first three weeks of January – usually the height of the season – rainfall into the main Cantareira reservoir system was less than a quarter of the average for this period. The reservoir is now down to 5.4% of its capacity, according to government monitoring stations.     A São Paulo technician works on an electrical post during a 30-hour power outage in the Pinheiros neighbourhood of Sao Paulo.  Photograph: Reuters    In Rio, the four reservoirs in the Paraiba system – which supplies the main source of tap water in Rio – are at the lowest level in history – about 1%. The problem is spreading elsewhere. At least 93 cities have imposed rationing, affecting 3.9 million people. In the northeastern city of Olinda, authorities are cutting water supplies for three days a week. The shortages are affecting the poor more than anyone. Short of supplies for drinking, cooking and washing, several communities have taken to the streets to protest. Groups of residents have beaten empty buckets and cans to express their frustration in the Madureira district of Rio, which has been without tap water since before Christmas. The city of Guarapari has seen two such demonstrations. The media have reflected such frustrations. “Sem Luz, Sem Agua” (Without Light, Without Water) ran a front-page headline in the Extra newspaper. The finger of blame has been pointed at national and local governments that have responded slowly and fallen behind in upgrades of pipes, dams and transmission lines. Waste is rife. A recent central government report showed that 37% of tap water is lost due to leaky pipes, fraud and illegal access.     A worker from the São Paulo state company that provides water and sewage services inspects cracked ground near Jaguary dam, Braganca Paulista. Photograph: Reuters    São Paulo’s water company Sabesp has begun upgrading, but with 64,000 km of old pipes, this operation is likely to take many years. In the meantime they have extended reductions in pressure, which means many homes suffer water cuts for days on end. Water authorities counter that they are having to deal with extreme weather and rising demands from a growing and increasingly wealthy population. “There are a lot of factors behind this – rising population density, higher average temperatures increased water consumption and global warming” said Ian Cardoso from CEDAE, the company responsible for water in the state of Rio. Climate change, however is denied by the country’s new science minister, Aldo Rebelo, who has declared the environmental movement is “nothing less, in its geopolitical essence, than the bridgehead of imperialism”.     Scientists say Brazil’s weather patterns have been disrupted by the loss of Amazon rainforest. Photograph: Reuters    Scientists think otherwise. As well as global warming, they say Brazil’s weather patterns have been disrupted by the loss of Amazon rainforest and the growth of cities. Antonio Nobre, researcher in the government’s space institute, Earth System Science Centre, told the Guardian the logging and burning of the world’s greatest forest might be connected to worsening droughts – such as the one currently plaguing São Paulo – and is likely to lead eventually to more extreme weather events. Augusto José Pereira Filho, a hydrometeorology expert at the University of São Paulo, said the microclimate of the city was affected by population growth and urban expansion, which create a heat-island effect and reduce the amount of low cloud.

"Yosemite National Park’s famous waterfalls are cascading down the valley’s towering cliffs despite one of the worst droughts in California’s history. Thanks to a handful of December storms that have hit the dry state, Bridalveil, Cascade and Yosemite Falls are living up to their reputation as some of the most beautiful natural wonders in the country. At 2,425 feet, Yosemite Falls is one of the tallest in North America and comprises three separate waterfalls: Upper Yosemite Fall, Middle Cascades and Lower Yosemite Fall. The National Park Service has a webcam that shows latest conditions at Yosemite Falls.  The falls were mostly dry in the summer months, but two major storms moved through California in the past few weeks providing some water in the extremely dry state.          Yosemite falls in December    “When you stand close, the decibel level seems impossible,” Lucy Garces, 27, a park employee, told the LA Times.  “You can hear the power and the danger and you feel so small, but it’s so big that you get to be here and cherish it.” Vernal and Nevada falls have more land with snowmelt to feed them, so usually they fall longer and stronger later into the year than Yosemite Falls.             In May, snow surveys showed that the river drainage for the Merced and Tuolumne rivers that flow through waterfalls and creeks into the valley were at unusually low levels. Merced drainage was at 15% of average and Tuolumne at 25% average. In May 2011, the Merced river drainage was at 199% of the average and Tuolumne at 184% the average. While the rain and snow have helped the waterfalls, this month’s rain is barely putting a dent in the debilitating drought in the state. State officials warned on 12 December that consistent rains through the winter and spring are needed to begin drought recovery.

"Esidronio Arreola never gave much thought to the well that so reliably pumped water to his traditional clapboard house in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas. But one day in March, he opened the tap and all he got was air. Through the searing summer heat, the Mexican immigrant to California’s Central Valley and his family endured a daily routine of collecting water in his pickup truck from an emergency communal tank, washing from buckets and struggling to keep their withering orchard alive while they waited for snow to return to the mountains and begin the cycle of replenishing the aquifer that provides water to almost all the homes in the region. But as more of Arreola’s neighbours in East Porterville, a ramshackle, low-income town in sprawling Tulare County, reported their wells running dry, and state officials warned that the most severe drought in living memory may well extend into 2015 and beyond, he realised he might not have water for years to come. So Arreola, who makes his living dealing in old fridges and washing machines from his garage, bit the bullet and borrowed the lion’s share of the $11,000 it cost to drill a new well four times as deep as his old one. In mid-November, seven months after the pipes went dry, water began flowing to his taps again. Arreola just doesn’t know for how long. Yet for all the difficulties, he considers himself fortunate. “We’re among the lucky ones. It’s weird to say that, but our old well was shallow and ran dry early – so, once we decided, we only had to wait a month for them to start drilling a new one. Now the waiting list is a year and I hear the price has gone to $17,000,” he says.“There are a lot of people who cannot afford a new well. Even if you drill one, you don’t know how long it will last.”     Spray fan: Daniel Arreola and his father Esidronio use their new well after not having running water for over six months. Photograph: Barry J Holmes for the Observer    At the other end of Tulare County’s 4,800 square miles, Chris Kemper is the principal of the poorest school in California: Stone Corral Elementary. The water supply to his entire small town of about 500 people, Seville, stopped in April when its collective well ran dry. “We had sponge baths, like in the army. Doing that for a week or two isn’t bad but for months – it’s difficult. Well, it’s awful. The school found it harder and harder to function. When the kids would flush the toilet nothing would happen,” says Kemper. “If you can imagine going to an underdeveloped country, it was worse. No potable water. It was a humbling experience. You figure you’re here in California, which is a rich state in a developed country, but you turn on the water and it comes out in drips.” The only supply for Kemper and his eight children through a scorching summer was bottled water delivered by the county’s emergency office. “We used that for bathing. We used it for washing our clothes,” he said. “It really made you manage your life differently. It changed how we think about water. You appreciate just how precious water is in our lives.” Eight decades ago, the worst drought in living memory helped drive hundreds of thousands of people from Oklahoma’s Dust Bowl to central California in search of work and a future toiling on the fruit farms that fill the San valley. It’s a part of the American epic immortalised in John Steinbeck’s bitter novel, The Grapes of Wrath. In time, many of the “Okies” were replaced by Mexican migrant workers as the Central Valley farms grew to produce up to half of the US’s fruit, nuts and vegetables. But now the 400-mile long agricultural basin of four million people is facing its own life-changing drought that, like the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, is hitting hardest those with the least. California’s governor, Jerry Brown, declared an emergency in January as 2013 was the driest on record in the state, and this year is little better. The federal authorities say more than half of California is enduring “exceptional drought” – the highest category. The state’s main reservoirs are at an average of only 40% of capacity.     A lot of bottle: Chris Kemper, principal of the school in Seville, which has had to rely on delivered water.  Photograph: Barry J Holmes for the Observer    At the beginning of the year, John Laird, the state’s secretary for natural resources, told the US Congress in a letter that “California is experiencing the worst water crisis in our modern history. We are in our third consecutive year of below-normal precipitation and this year’s snowpack – on which 25 million Californians depend as the source of their water supply – currently is only 10% of what it should be. “As you know, California’s climate is such that it is generally dry for almost half the year – and we rely on rain and snow during the winter season to carry us through the year,” he wrote. “Conditions – in terms of both supply and quality – are unprecedented and serious.” A recent study for the National Science Foundation, a US government agency, found that the drought is “very likely” linked to climate change. The immediate cause is a region of high atmospheric pressure over the Pacific, diverting storms away from California. Known to scientists as the “Ridiculously Resilient Ridge”, it is blamed on rising greenhouse gases and the study described its persistence and intensity as “unrivalled”. Other studies say California is part of a “mega-drought” in the western US that could stretch for decades, even if the rains return periodically. The sharp drop in water levels in rivers, canals and dams is responsible for what a University of California report called “the greatest absolute reduction in water availability for California agriculture ever seen”. That has prompted farmers to seek alternative sources of irrigation for ever-more-demanding crops. Drought-resistant cotton has given way to more profitable but thirsty plants such as the massive almond farms which now grow 80% of the world’s supply – farmers are now drilling under their fields to tap into aquifers. But that has only added to the pressure on groundwater already depleted by lack of snow on the mountains. As agriculture drew heavily, wells serving individual houses and small communities began to suck air. The impact in Tulare County, where some of the richest agricultural areas in the US sit alongside people with the lowest incomes, is starkly on display. There are queues at communal water tanks and the irrigated fields plump with crops abruptly give way to hard-baked soil forced to sit fallow.     ‘We bought in three truckloads of water and got rid of it in eight hours’: Andrew Lockman, manager of the Office of Emergency Services for Tulare County, being interviewed. Photograph: Barry J Holmes for the Observer    Within Tulare County, where one-third of the population lives below the poverty line, nowhere is harder hit than East Porterville – a community of about 7,400 people. More than half of homes are now without running water and many of the remainder wonder how long their wells will last. “Back in January, the county was getting these sporadic calls: ‘Hey, my well’s gone dry,’” says Andrew Lockman, head of Tulare County’s Office of Emergency Services, who is in charge of relief efforts. “By June, there were over 800 households with dry wells. In East Porterville, we brought in three full truckloads of bottled water – 15,552 gallons of drinking water – and we got rid of all of it in about eight hours.” Lockman installed a 5,000-gallon tank in front of the fire station with a motorised pump. A steady stream of residents make the daily journey to fill buckets and drums. Houses without running water – mostly small, low-slung bungalows on plots marked out by wire fences – are often signalled by large blue storage barrels. Many of the houses are wood with corrugated iron roofs that drive people outdoors in the scorching midday heat. The sun has drained colour from their walls and paint is luxury for families struggling to pay for utilities. If there are gardens at all, and mostly there is only bone-dry dirt, they have withered for want of water. No one is going to waste it on grass, although some, like Arreola, are trying to save sources of food. He’s been using waste water to keep alive a small orchard of kiwi fruits, and lemon, apple and cherry trees. There has been no fruit this year but the vines have survived. If the drought has taken a physical toll it doesn’t seem to show on faces already weathered by years in the fields. Some seem to shrug off the added hardship as just another price of poverty. Lockman has been struck by the stoicism of people. “We’re seeing a lot of neighbour helping neighbour,” he says. “We see a lot of folks in East Porterville who say, ‘You’re out of water, hook up to mine,’ knowing full well that theirs is low and then theirs goes out. Choosing to help their neighbours to their own detriment over time is pretty refreshing to see.” For all that, some residents in low-income communities feel shunned by more affluent towns close by. The city of Porterville has for years resisted incorporating East Porterville into its municipality, and hooking it up to a reliable water system, out of a suspicion that it would drag down property values. And as grateful as residents are for the assistance they receive, there is worried talk in some low-income communities that people could lose their homes because of regulations requiring houses to have running water. Steve Worthley, a member of Tulare County’s council, the Board of Supervisors, is aware of the concern but does not entirely allay fears. “We’re not doing that and we have no desire to, but as a long-term situation, people cannot live in a home without water,” he says. With winter setting in, Lockman decided it was too much to ask people to wash in buckets, so in mid-November he moved in two articulated lorries with shower stalls. Some residents had already taken to using the showers at a camp site at a neighbouring artificial lake.     Success Lake: fishing well below the usual shoreline. Photograph: Barry J Holmes for the Observer    Water levels have fallen so far that much of Success Lake’s 150ft-high dam is visible. A road that served as a boat ramp now ends abruptly 35ft above the water. “Have you seen the lake?” says Katherine Hampton, sitting on the doorstep of her wood cabin home on the edge of East Porterville. A large broken window is roughly patched up with a piece of board. “It’s normally so full. It’s so down right now you can walk across it.” Hampton, 32, has five children and is pregnant with her sixth. The drought has cost her husband, Johnathan, his job. “I haven’t worked in eight months,” he says. “I work in agriculture doing anything: transplanting trees, yard work, tilling ground. I was going around all the farms asking, and everyone was saying ‘no’. I thought maybe they had a problem with me. I went to four or five different farms in Tulare. Then I came across a big old sign: ‘Water shortage. No jobs for farm hands.’ So I came home.” Hampton gets no unemployment benefit because he didn’t hold a permanent job. He takes the hardships in his stride. “I do anything I can do. Cleaning people’s houses when they move out. There’s not much work. We get by because we don’t spend much,” he says. He’s a man of God and says the drought is part of the Lord’s plan. “People are small in their faith and bring this on themselves,” he said. “I’m hoping people start praying there’ll be some water.” The University of California report estimates that the drought has already cost the state’s agricultural industry $1.5bn and 17,000 jobs. But the dependence of so many people in Tulare County on agriculture for a living has largely muted any criticism of farmers for drilling deeper and pumping more. “People see farms getting water as a necessity,” said Kemper. “They’re more resentful of the water going to the cities than to the farmers.” The drought has exacerbated a less visible but widespread issue: pollutants contaminating the underground water. Nitrates from fertilisers and septic tanks have been feeding into the groundwater for decades. A University of California study found that one in 10 people in the Central Valley are exposed to unsafe drinking water. But as water levels have fallen, the nitrates – which are dangerous to young children, nursing mothers and the elderly – have become more concentrated and the drinking water even less safe. Susana de Anda, director of the Community Water Centre in Tulare County, which campaigns for access to clean water, said more than one million people in California are drinking from contaminated supplies. “More residents are getting notifications not to drink the water because they are over the legal limit of the contaminant,” she says.      Tulare’s health department has issued thousands of letters to users of municipal systems warning against drinking the water, but no one knows how many individual wells are also affected because they are not tested. The situation in Seville was so bad that in 2011 it attracted the attention of a United Nations investigation into lack of access to clean water. Its report warned that what amounts to discrimination in the provision of water and sanitation in parts of the US “may intensify in the coming years with climate change and competing demands for ever scarce water resources”. Earlier this year, Seville’s school board became so alarmed at tests showing high levels of contamination that it decided to start buying bottled drinking water for students at a cost of $700 a month from Kemper’s budget. “That’s money we’re spending that could buy a laptop a month for the school,” he says. But the drought has, to some extent, proved fortuitous for Seville because one crisis has drawn action on another. The state and federal authorities did little over the polluted water, but once there was none at all, funds were rapidly found to drill a new well. It was built and on line within a week in August – a speed Lockman describes as unprecedented – at a cost of more than $250,000. “Frankly, we kind of look at that as a silver lining of the story,” says Lockman. “If we didn’t have all the other drought issues going on, we probably wouldn’t have been able to make that happen.” But Lockman says that Seville is probably not an example for a lot of other towns. For a start, it already had an established municipal water system. “There’s going to be a lot of places where there’s nothing around,” he says. “East Porterville is probably our biggest challenge. We’ve looked at putting in a new water system. It’s really not viable to do, largely because that area has nitrate contamination.” The crisis has forced California to think about long-term management of the ever-increasing demand for its limited water supplies. A state-wide conservation campaign has reduced water consumption in urban areas by about 10% over the past year, even if some of southern California’s wealthiest residents have come under fire for continuing to water the vast lawns of their sprawling mansions as if there was no crisis. Individual cities have introduced a slew of initiatives, such as San Diego’s recycling of wastewater for drinking.      In October, the governor approved new laws to regulate the use of underground water supplies for the first time in the state’s history. Worthley says that should include rationing in agriculture. “There are going to be some very serious issues in agriculture about what is going to be a sustainable yield of water,” he points out. “My guess is that there’s going to be a monitoring of the wells to see how much they’ve been taking out and a limit on how much they can remove. You’re going to have to decide: how much of my land do I allow to go fallow? Do I grow a different kind of crop?” Farmers are not likely to accept further restrictions without a fight. Relief programmes are in part funded by federal money and Congress in Washington is considering its own legislation to address the crisis. But California’s leaders fear federal laws being used for political ends – particularly to weaken environmental standards at the behest of large agricultural corporations and some cities, which object to water being shifted from farms to fish conservation. While the severity of the drought in some ways matches that which created the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, the consequences so far are very different. For a start, it has not prompted a mass migration. Kemper came to Seville from LA because he was weary of the problems and violence of an inner-city school. Back then he wondered why modern day agricultural workers didn’t follow the example of the Okies in the 1930s and go somewhere else. “When I lived in Los Angeles and I’d hear about drought I used to think, ‘Why don’t those people just move?’ But living here, you see why. Where do you go? When you’re a poor family, to move is very expensive. You have to have a job and most people here work in agriculture and those jobs are hard to find elsewhere,” he said. In any case, a house without water is almost impossible to sell. But even in Seville, with its new well, there is a recognition that, with warnings of waves of drought to come, it is only a solution for so long as there is water under the town. “It’s the future we’re afraid of,” says Kemper. “What happens if this isn’t the end? Life is going to change totally in our society. When water ceases, what do you do? If we don’t have agriculture, we don’t have anything here. If water goes, it’ll turn into another wasteland.”     Scorched earth: Lake Kaweah, a flood control reservoir in Tulare County, California, is now down to just 8% capacity.

"Mercedes Azevedo lost her house and 17 relatives when a mudslide triggered by hurricane Mitch engulfed her village in October 1998. More than 2,500 people died in the Casita Volcano tragedy, one of the worst in Nicaragua’s recent history.  Now, 51-year-old Azevedo and her fellow survivors find themselves under threat from the weather once again. This time it’s too little rain, not too much.   “I lost all my crops in the first harvest: three manzanas (5.2 acres) of corn and one manzana of beans. Everything, gone … I rent my land and now have debts I can’t repay,” she says, standing on the porch of the house in Santa Maria, Chinandega province, where she was resettled after the hurricane. Drought, floods and price hikes  She’s not alone. A severe four-month drought during this year’s “wet” season hit agricultural production in two-thirds of the country’s 153 municipalities. More than 100,000 farmers were affected, according to official figures.   At the height of the drought, thought to be the worst in Nicaragua for 44 years, the government needed to provide subsidised rice and beans to stave off a hunger crisis. At one stage, it even advised people to supplement their diet by breeding iguanas for consumption.   “It’s been tough. We’ve had to substitute beans for rice, tortillas and potatoes,” says 49-year-old Julieta Bucardo, a shopper in the central market of León. “The price of beans, for example, reached more than 37 cordovas (£0.89) recently. At the start of the year, we used to think 15 was a lot.”   When the prolonged drought eventually ended in late August, it did so with such violence that the government announced an emergency to cope with the flash floods. Only with the recent arrival of the year’s second harvest has the price of staple grains begun to fall.   Nicaragua’s recent weather patterns will not surprise many climate scientists. The 2013 global climate risk survey (pdf) places the Central American nation of 6 million people fourth in its list of countries most affected by climate change. “The variability of the climate is starting to become an almost normal process, with long periods of drought and then floods,” says Germán Quezada, a climate specialist at Centro Humboldt, a Managua-based NGO.   “The problem is that the usual pattern of cultivation has been thrown up in the air. People just aren’t sure when to plant or what to plant,” says Quezada. “Small farmers are the worst hit because they don’t have the resources or irrigation that the large farmers have.”  A recent study (pdf) by the International Centre of Tropical Agriculture predicts that if temperatures continue to rise, Nicaragua could see its annual corn and bean production drop by up to 34,000 tonnes and 9,000 tonnes by 2020, respectively.      Counting the cost … coffee-growing in Matagalpa region, Nicaragua. Photograph: Oliver Balch    Nicaragua’s coffee industry is already counting the cost. The country’s second largest agricultural export earner registered losses of up to $60m in 2012-13 due to an outbreak of coffee leaf rust, which spread to 37% of the crop.   “Coffee leaf rust only used to affect farms below around 800 metres. With the changes in climate, we’re now seeing the disease reach as high as 1,300 metres,” says Santiago Dolmos, an agronomist with Cecocafen, a major coffee exporter. Climate-friendly agriculture “Treating these kind of losses as an emergency situation is not the answer. It has to be part of a longer-term development solution,” argues Azevedo.  For Nicaragua’s agribusiness lobby, such a solution lies in the greater use of chemicals and more advanced technological inputs. Upanic, for instance, an influential industry group, held the country’s first conference on agricultural biotechnology in October.  Environmental groups are pushing for a different approach, arguing that the best defence against climate change is a more diversified, more ecological approach to farming. Their arguments chime with Nicaragua’s strategy for food sovereignty and security (pdf), which includes a law promoting organic and agro-ecological production. “Large-scale agriculture isn’t the answer,” argues Rafael Henríquez, a spokesman for Oxfam Nicaragua. “Ironically, it’s the poorest farmers that are closest to the agro-ecological model, although it’s more through necessity than environmental conviction.” The national roundtable for risk management in Nicaragua, an alliance of 20 smallholder organisations, is working to formalise these incipient, ad hoc efforts with research and training in best practice.   Nicaragua’s commitment to small-scale, ecological agriculture is by no means secure, says Martín Cuadra, a rural development expert at Simas, a Managua-based research institute and member of the roundtable. He points to loopholes in a proposed law on the registration of seeds that could open the door to genetically modified crops.  “The effects of climate change combine with global pressures from agribusiness companies to introduce GMOs,” says Cuadra, who believes such a move would ultimately imperil smallholders’ freedom. “Those who control the seeds control the stomach. And those who control the stomach, control life itself.”  ",2014-12-10T07:00:11Z,Climate change in Nicaragua pushes farmers into uncertain world,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""df7e49795e075080c80ab7cc8908044266aeeccc""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/24/1416843032966/e9ef4200-4edf-48fa-8694-38cb256fee90-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""This year’s drought in Nicaragua has been the worst in 44 years.

"Anheuser-Busch InBev uses a lot of water. It is a central ingredient in beer; but the brewing giant also uses water to grow barley, to generate steam and to clean its facilities. And when you use as much water as Anheuser-Busch InBev does, small changes in access and pricing have a big impact. “Generally, most stakeholders agree that water is an undervalued natural resource and that we need to understand its true value,” said Hugh Share, the company’s senior global director for beer and better world. “As we see stress [on natural resources] increase globally in certain regions, I think we can expect water costs to increase.” This challenge is what the water, energy, and hygiene services company Ecolab hopes to confront with a new water-pricing tool released last month. Using a range of factors from a region’s water scarcity to its plans for future growth, the Water Risk Monetizer aims to give corporations the information they need to make more geographically targeted, financially wise decisions about the true risks and costs of their water usage. “The target for this tool in our mind is operations at the site level,” said Emilio Tenuta, vice president of corporate sustainability for Ecolab. “Water is a local issue and we want to make sure we start there.” Although water is crucial to businesses from breweries to tech companies, it has traditionally been relatively inexpensive. As a result, many corporations have done little to make their water use more efficient, focusing instead on more costly resources.  “There’s been a lot of dialogue about it but very little action,” he said. “It’s very difficult to implement conservation projects when you don’t feel the implications.” Climate change, persistent droughts and regulatory changes, however, now have businesses paying more attention. Droughts in the western US have sparked worries about the agriculture industry, while groundwater stores have been declining across the country. Earlier this summer, authorities in northern India ordered a Coca-Cola plant to cease operations, claiming the beverage maker was drawing too much water. As corporate strategists devote more thought to water conservation, however, they are running up against a problem: water prices vary widely across the country and the globe. And these prices do not necessarily reflect wider environmental and social risks and costs that water usage might incur.   “There’s really a lot of attention that needs to be placed to pricing water more rationally,” said Ed Osann, senior policy analyst with the National Resources Defense Council. Ecolab, along with London-based environmental data firm Trucost, has devised an algorithm to tackle this challenge. Available free of charge, the Water Risk Monetizer asks users to enter their location, the amount of water they use, the amount they expect to use over the next three years, and the price they currently pay. For manufacturing facilities, the location’s productivity is also entered.  The program then uses this information and looks at a region’s water scarcity, the role the watershed plays in the local community and environment, and the potential for changes in the area’s gross domestic product. These factors, taken together, are used to determine a premium: a number businesses can add to the base price of water to get a figure that more accurately represents the true cost – and the true risk – of their water use.  Ecolab and Trucost aren’t alone in trying to help enterprises take a closer look at their water use. The Water Resource Institute’s Aqueduct maps help users visualize different water risks around the world, for example, and the Global Water Tool from the World Business Council for Sustainable Development enables companies to generate risk analyses for each of their sites. Meanwhile, companies can use the Water Risk Monetizer’s price premium – called, variously, a shadow price, phantom price or internal price – to assess the impact and cost of proposed projects, Tenuta said.  Many companies prefer to invest in projects that pay off within two years; using the higher shadow price in these calculations can help companies make choices that are better for both their bottom lines and the water supply over that timeframe. The pricing tool allows users to enter and compare multiple sites. The resulting numbers let companies look at their water use across locations in a very detailed way; a manufacturing company, for example, might realize that certain processes are best moved from one facility to another with more resilient water resources.  “The essence of the tool is all about taking action,” Tenuta said.  To truly make a difference, however, a company must consider the attitudes of customers and the communities in which they operate, said Will Sarni, leader of the water enterprise strategy practice at consulting firm Deloitte. And so far, the Water Risk Monetizer does not put a number – or monetary value – on these sorts of reputational risks.  Currently, Ecolab’s tool tackles this challenge by using input from WWF’s Water Risk Filter and returning a reputational risk rating of high, medium or low; it does not translate that assessment into dollars and cents – yet.  “Monetizing those types of risks is challenging, but it is something we’re hoping to do in a future iteration of the tool,” said Steven Bullock, head of research for Trucost.  Sarni explained that even as water crises loom, the good news is that these threats are likely to kickstart a wave of business ingenuity. Current water concerns should spark developments in water technology, analytics, efficiency, and treatment. “Resource scarcity drives innovation,” he said. The water hub is funded by Grundfos.

"A new paper published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters by Griffin &amp; Anchukaitis concludes that the 2012–2014 drought in California was its most intense in at least 1,200 years. The study used drought reconstructions from tree-ring cores, from the North American Drought Atlas (NADA) and from cores Griffin &amp; Anchukaitis collected from blue oak trees in southern and central California. Blue oak tree ring widths are particularly sensitive to moisture changes. According to Griffin,  California’s old blue oaks are as close to nature’s rain gauges as we get      Pencil-like tree-ring cores are collected non-destructively using a Swedish increment borer. May 2014, image by Daniel Griffin.    The study compared today’s drought conditions in California to those reconstructed over the past 1,200 years using the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), an estimate of available soil moisture. The data showed that California is experiencing its most intense drought in over a millennium,  the current event is the most severe drought in the last 1200 years, with single year (2014) and accumulated moisture deficits worse than any previous continuous span of dry years … In terms of cumulative severity, it is the worst drought on record (-14.55 cumulative PDSI), more extreme than longer (4- to 9-year) droughts.      Long-term (800 to 2014) composite NADA (black line) and instrumental (solid red line) PDSI. The horizontal dashed red line and star indicate the 2014 value.

What’s interesting is that the blue oak data showed that while precipitation levels in California have been low over the past 3 years, the levels haven’t been unprecedented.     Long-term (1293 to 2014) reconstructed (black line) and instrumental (blue line) normalized precipitation anomalies. The dashed blue line and star indicate the 2014 value. Photograph: Geophysical Research Letters.    But at the same time as California has been getting little rain, it’s also experienced record hot temperatures. It’s the heat that’s pushed the drought into unprecedented territory. Griffin &amp; Anchukaitis concluded,  temperature could have exacerbated the 2014 drought by approximately 36% … These observations from the paleoclimate record suggest that high temperatures have combined with the low but not yet exceptional precipitation deficits to create the worst short-term drought of the last millennium for the state of California … Future severe droughts are expected to be in part driven by anthropogenic influences and temperatures outside the range of the last millennium.  Another new paper also published in Geophysical Research Letters by scientists at the University of California, Irvine likewise recognizes the extreme and unprecedented nature of California’s current drought, and focuses on the risks that these events pose in the present and future.  Despite the well-recognized interdependence between temperature and precipitation … little attention has been paid to risk analysis of concurrent extreme droughts and heatwaves … We argue that the global warming and the associated increase in extreme temperatures substantially increase the chance of concurrent droughts and heatwaves.  As the authors note, at issue is the fact that humans are causing temperatures to rise. Thus although droughts will always happen naturally, as studies have shown, they’ll become more intense in a warmer world. The combination of dry, hot weather will create bigger risks for Californians. The human connection to the California drought Climate scientist Michael Mann nicely summarized the ways that humans may have contributed to the current California drought,  In fact, there are at least three different mechanisms that are potentially relevant to the connection between the 2013/2014 California drought and human-caused climate change.  There is (1) the impact of climate change on the pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) off the west coast. One recent study suggests that climate change favors an SST pattern in the North Pacific that increases the incidence of the atmospheric circulation pattern responsible for the current drought.  Then there is (2) the marked decrease in Arctic Sea Ice due to global warming. Studies going back more than a decade show that reduced Arctic sea ice may also favor such an atmospheric circulation pattern. More recent work by Jennifer Francis of Rutgers provides independent support for that mechanism.  Finally, there is (3) the effect of global warming on soil moisture. All other things being equal, warming of soils leads to greater rates of evaporation and drying. This mechanism leads to worsened drought even if rainfall patterns are unchanged.  There’s been some confusion about the human influence on the drought because two studies published this year didn’t find a connection to the lack of rainfall. However, as Mann noted, those studies did not consider the three mechanisms listed above. They were incomplete. On the other hand, two other studies that considered the first factor did find a connection. A high pressure ridge sitting of California’s coast for several years (known as the “Ridiculously Resilient Ridge” for its persistence) has been a primary factor contributing to the low levels of precipitation. The ridge has pushed storms north of California, leaving the state dry. A study led by Noah Diffenbaugh at Stanford used modeling and statistics to find that these sorts of persistent high-pressure ridges are more likely to sit off California’s coast in the presence of high levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Another paper published this year by Simon Wang and colleagues similarly concluded that human-caused global warming is changing conditions in the Pacific Ocean that make these high-pressure ridges off the coast stronger, thus intensifying droughts in California. In short, it appears that humans are contributing to the strength of high pressure ridges off California’s coast, which will tend to reduce the amount of precipitation in the state. High temperatures exacerbate these dry conditions by increasing evaporation, soil dryness, and water demand. According to Griffin &amp; Anchukaitis, the record heat intensified the drought by about 36%, leading to exceptional drought conditions unprecedented in the past 1,200 years. The drought alone is anticipated to cost California over $2 billion this year. On top of that, heat and drought also create conditions ripe for wildfires; another major problem for California. As expected, California also saw an intense wildfire season in 2014, blowing well through its firefighting budget. Now that the state is finally seeing some significant rainfall in December, those wildfires created conditions conducive to flooding and mudslides. As a major agricultural producer, this extreme weather in California impacts the entire country and world. However, it’s also giving us a glimpse at the risks we all face if we fail to curb global warming. Heatwaves, droughts, floods, wildfires, and other types of extreme weather are becoming more intense due to human-caused global warming. The longer we wait to cut carbon pollution and slow global warming, the more extreme our weather and its impacts will become.",2014-12-08T14:00:02Z,"California just had its worst drought in over 1200 years, as temperatures and risks rise","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""8849acf05d5d7d25634bc5a332cd3538c718c2de""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/6/1417828741795/4c6f6467-f6e3-42fb-99db-564fbd5ecb0b-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""This photo shows the dried up lake bed of Huntington Lake which at only 30% capacity as California is gripped by its worst drought in over a millennium."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">This photo shows the dried up lake bed of Huntington Lake which at only 30% capacity as California is gripped by its worst drought in over a millennium.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",82,<strong>Dana Nuccitelli: </strong>Global warming is playing havoc on extreme weather<br>,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/6/1417828742216/4c6f6467-f6e3-42fb-99db-564fbd5ecb0b-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/dec/08/california-just-had-its-worst-drought-in-over-1200-years,6,negative
"Which would you rather have: lettuce and carrots for your salads, or affordable gasoline for your car? Affordable food prices or affordable electricity? You’ll have to make the choice. In fact, if you like a ready supply of tasty, affordable produce – and low food prices generally – this may be the time to start worrying. And not just about the drought in California, where desperate, panicky farmers are responding to the years-long dry spell by hiring dowsers – water witches – to scour their land for hidden wells, or the the south-west, which is in the grip of a “megadrought”.  Even in areas where drought isn’t a problem, the stress on limited water resources is approaching perilous levels, according to a new report from MSCI Inc. Rainfall levels may be just fine in areas like Boston or Long Island, but these regions rely heavily on irrigation to keep crops growing, and competition for those water resources just keeps growing from big industries.  There are simply too many water-intensive industries competing for increasingly scarce water resources. “And now there are conflicts looming,” says Linda-Eling Lee, global head of ESG research for MSCI Inc in New York, who has delved into what this means for all of us.  “Right now in the United States there is a lot of attention to the problems that water shortages are causing for farmers and for residential users,” says Lee. California farmers have stopped growing avocadoes; house-proud residents of drought-stricken areas are banned from watering their lawns. “But there’s less attention to the conflict looming between industry and agriculture.” Consider Kern County, California. It is home to the North Belridge and South Belridge oil fields, the country’s sixth largest oil areas. A lot of the production in the Belridge fields has come from fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, a process that involves injecting a mixture of water, sand and chemicals into shale rocks containing oil and gas to break them open, enabling the well operators to extract them.  The region, near Bakersfield, also is home to half of the country’s carrot crop and 40% of its pistachio production, Lee says.  These two industries are in direct competition for water. Last summer, Kern County was in crisis mode, getting only about a third of the water it had expected from the California State Water Project. So, who gets that water: the Shell/ExxonMobil joint venture now running Belridge, or the carrot and pistachio farmers?      An oil rig extracts crude in Taft, California. Kern County produces 75% of the oil in the state. In an earlier oil boom era, Taft was the site of the 1910 Lakeside Gusher, the biggest oil gusher ever seen in the US, which destroyed the derrick and sent 100,000 barrels a day into a lake of crude. Photograph: David McNew/Getty Images    We don’t know yet. And this conflict is a big threat, says CDP, an environmental non-profit organization that reports, in a study released Wednesday, that two-thirds of the world’s largest businesses now add “water risk” to the list of risks with which they have to deal on a daily basis. Of these, CDP says, 68% say this could result in “substantive change” to the way they do business and 22% believe it could end up hurting their growth potential. If you’re an investor in those businesses – or you work for one of them – that’s bad news.  It’s a worldwide problem. The reservoir that serves Sāo Paulo, one of Brazil’s largest cities, hit its lowest recorded level, about 4% of capacity, this year, thanks to a combination of drought and heavy usage. Even without the additional stress created by drought, worldwide, expanding population levels and increased demand from both agriculture and industry. Lee notes that in South Africa, ranchers and mining companies have ended up in conflict. Water could end up being the new gold, or the new crude oil. For now, however, it’s still an input. It is used to generate electrical power, to make paper and chemicals, to extract and refine crude oil. Within the US farming industry, cotton farmers are most reliant on water, followed by farmers who grow corn and hay to be used as animal feed.  There may be no perfect answers. We want low-priced carrots from Kern County and lettuce (44% of which is grown in water-scarce Monterey County, California).  We have a newfound obsession with almond milk, even though almonds – a $4bn a year crop – require immense amounts of water to grow, are almost entirely grown only in drought-stricken California where the climate is suitable but where the competition for water resources is fiercest. At the same time, higher gasoline prices fuel anxiety and anger.  It doesn’t much matter what is rising in price – electricity, gasoline, food. All are vital; none are discretionary purchases. And for all but the top 1% of Americans, our earnings haven’t risen to be able to cope with higher costs.     Almond-producing land is one of the highest priced and most sought-after in California. The $4bn a year industry is creating competition for water. Photograph: Al Golub/AP    Ultimately, some of the battles over who gets to use the increasingly scarce water resources – not just in places like California, but in areas like Idaho, the Dakotas, across the midwest, Milwaukee and even pockets of the north-east, where rainfall is ample – may end up being settled by politicians or in the courts.  That means, now that one election cycle is over, it might be time to start looking around at your local politicians and asking them what their thoughts are on this topic, if it hasn’t already become a hot-button issue as it has in California. If water, a scarce resource, gets rationed, who gets cut off? Who will pay higher prices first?  If you’re an investor, you can reward companies who are taking steps to use water more efficiently. CDP notes that changing a soldering practice at Cisco saved the company $1m a year (chump change for a company that big, perhaps, but still sound practice) and resulted in the electronics giant using less water. Look around for companies that talk openly about water management issues and report to investors about what they are doing to reduce their consumption – and avoid those that duck the issue.  “This requires reconfiguring the entire economy, over the long run,” says MSCI’s Lee. Then, too, beginning to reconfigure our personal economies can’t help, even if it is only in the planning stages for now. If you’re thinking of buying a house in the next five or 10 years, why not think about buying one that you can convert to operate on solar or wind energy and reduce your reliance on water-hungry utilities?  Oh, and reconsider that almond milk addiction.",2014-11-06T13:00:00Z,Kale or fracking?

"Climate change is making both droughts and flood more frequent and severe. Whether your area is suffering from too much water or too little, here are things you can do to adapt. Drought In the face of relentless droughts such as the historic one underway in California, we all want to help conserve. But with water utilities increasingly introducing tiered pricing – in which people who use more water pay an increasingly higher price for it – cutting back can reap monetary savings as well. Replace lawns with native plants Outdoor water use accounts for 30% of residential demand across the US, and 80% in the arid West, according to Mary Ann Dickinson, president of the Alliance for Water Efficiency. Nixing grass for drought-tolerant native plants can save as much as 10,000 gallons of water a year. Or reduce your lawn’s size and replace standard grass with low-water varieties that make do with two-thirds less water. Local native plant societies often know which plants made your lot home before you did. In the West, where most rain comes during the winter, plant natives in the fall. Natives also provide habitat for local butterflies and birds, and can be more resistant to wildfire than ornamentals. Cut the flush  Toilets use the most water of all indoor fixtures, nearly 30% of home water use, according to the EPA. Drop-A-Brick offers an easy way to cut back. The flattened brick is filled with a powder that turns solid when it gets wet, giving it the weight needed to sink. One $15 Drop-A-Brick in a toilet’s tank will displace almost half a gallon of water per flush, saving around $25 a year on water bills. Why use a manufactured, $15 brick instead of a Lifehacker-style solution like a milk jug filled with water? It “actually improves flushing performance in most [toilets] because it causes water to accelerate more quickly through the flush valve, according to engineers,” said Ali Hart, director of toilet relations for “Project: Drop-A-Brick.” No more flushing twice to clear low-flow toilets! “The real goal of this campaign,” she added, “is to raise awareness about urban water conservation.” Get savvy People tend to dramatically underestimate personal water use. One study found that Americans lowballed their water use by a factor of two. One reason is that we typically get one water bill every two months – a huge gap between use habits and measurement. Tech companies like WaterSmart and Dropcountr are trying to reverse this trend.  Dropcountr’s mobile app allows you to track how you use water, set conservation goals, access rebates for low-flow appliances and more. It also alerts you to usage trends that may land you in a higher-priced billing tier and adds a competitive factor by tracking how well you’re keeping up (or rather down) with the Joneses.  Use rain barrels and graywater systems  Plants don’t need drinking-quality water. Connecting rain barrels to downspouts is an inexpensive way to harvest rain to supply your garden. Such on-site water supplies increase your water security, independence, and efficiency. Overachieving water conservers have long put a bucket in the shower or kitchen sink to collect “greywater” for plants outside. But an installed system delivering greywater from, say, your washing machine in the garage into your garden would be much easier. Such systems have long been illegal in many jurisdictions, but that’s beginning to change thanks in part to groups like Greywater Action. Opt for dual plumbing Your toilet doesn’t require drinking water, either. A dual plumbing system allows you to reroute greywater or rainwater back into your house for flushing (or use utility-delivered treated wastewater in some districts). Pipes that route non-potable water are colored purple so that everyone knows not to connect them to sinks. A diverter valve allows people to choose potable water for some needs and alternative water for the rest. If you’re buying a new house in an area where purple pipes are now in the building code, such as San Francisco, you could be on the cutting-edge of water conservation. Otherwise, save this strategy for a major remodel. Floods Worldwide, increasing development in floodplains is paving over soil that would otherwise soak up water. Coastal plain development is also booming, creating infrastructure that’s more vulnerable than ever as sea levels rise with climate change. A World Bank report last year found that flood damage to coastal cities worldwide could reach $1tn annually. To avoid paying your share of that, consider the following adaptations. Location, location, location This may be obvious, but think before you move. Whether buying or renting, consult flood maps to see if that lovely home is at high risk. If you simply must live near a coast or river, choose or build a home elevated to a height above your area’s predicted flood level rise. Raise the mechanicals and valuables Move vulnerable elements like furnaces, water heaters and electric panels to higher ground when building or remodeling. If you have a basement, don’t keep a giant plasma TV, gaming center or collection of antiquarian books down there. Relocate If flooded, put government emergency grants or insurance payouts toward moving to higher ground, not rebuilding. Some cities that flood regularly have used such funds to buy out willing homeowners and transform floodplains into open space. If your city doesn’t offer this option, introduce it at planning meetings. After Tulsa, Oklahoma, bought and removed more than 800 flood-damaged homes and vulnerable buildings and turned the floodplain into a park, flood insurance rates dropped 25%. Plan for soft failure If you’re already living in a flood zone, you can make your home resilient via renovations that minimize the effect of floodwater. Choose flood damage-resistant materials such as glazed brick, concrete, stone, steel or recycled plastic lumber. Anchor the foundation to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Create “flow-through” features on the lower levels to prevent water pressure damage. Use rain gardens and low-impact development Permeable surfaces are your friends. Rather than paving your driveway, choose materials such as pavers that allow water to seep through them into the ground, or gravel. Consider your lot’s slope. Water should flow away from your home, not toward it. Creating a rain garden will slow runoff and allow more absorption into the ground. Add slopes that funnel water into a bioswale (a fancy name for a ditch covered in stones or native grasses), toward planting spaces or a nearby creek, or even into an underground storage catchment that can hold water for drier times, or allow water to seep slowly into the aquifer. If you’re a city-dweller with pavement right up to your house, investigate a permit to dig up part of the sidewalk and plant a small garden that will convey water underground. Stay informed Apps are not just for the drought-afflicted. Using real-time data from the US Geological Survey and National Weather Service, FloodWatch gives both recent and historical river heights, precipitation totals, and flood stage data throughout the United States. The app allows you to monitor nearby rivers and streams and keep an eye on potential flooding issues, giving you time to move valuables to safety. For worldwide information check out the Flood App from Swiss Re, the leading global reinsurer. With a focus on climate change adaptation, the app offers reliable if general information on flood risks and how to manage and insure these risks. Get flood insurance Floods are the most common natural disaster. But flood losses are often not covered under standard renter or homeowner’s insurance policies. The good news is that often you can purchase flood-specific insurance. However, some firms are leaving flood-prone areas, reasoning it’s bad business to continue insuring such risky properties. If that’s the case where you live, consider it a sign that you should move. In the United States, the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), administered by Fema, provides federally subsidized plans in locales that agree to implement its floodplain management ordinances. Homeowners, business owners, and renters in participating areas can purchase these plans via www.FloodSmart.gov.

"A year ago, Lauren Porter worked out twice a week at dawn with a women’s soccer club on the main recreational field at the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC). The field commands a view of scenic Monterey Bay. “Every morning, it was so great,” says 21-year-old Porter, a fourth-year environmental studies major. But this academic year there will be no workouts on that field for Porter or anybody else, thanks to the California drought. Under a sharp cutback in irrigation to meet tough city water-rationing rules imposed last spring, the 10-acre grass turf became too dry and brittle for safe play. UCSC closed the field last month, effective through June 2015. While a smaller grass field remains open for varsity soccer and some non-varsity sports, Porter’s group has been left scrambling to find another home. School and college sports are one of the latest casualties of a relentless drought that has left 95% of the state suffering severe to exceptional drought conditions. State and federal water-delivery systems have drastically cut supplies to agriculture, which typically consumes 80% of California’s water supply. That’s spurred food growers in the Central Valley into an unregulated frenzy of drilling private wells to tap into groundwater aquifers, even as some small communities are running out of drinking water. Just a couple hours’ drive from the Central Valley – and 35 miles from the Salinas Valley, the “Salad Bowl of America” – the city of Santa Cruz has responded more aggressively to the drought than most California cities because, isolated by a coastal mountain range, it gets all its water from a local reservoir and river that are running low. The town declared a water emergency early last year and, in May, imposed mandatory restrictions on all residents and businesses in order to cut overall consumption by 25%. Since then, average daily water usage has been reduced from roughly 10m gallons to 7m gallons, says Toby Goddard of the city water agency. “But it’s not without pain and consequence.” Take outdoor irrigation, a major water guzzler. The agency required customers with large landscaped sites, including schools and city parks, to limit themselves to just one-third of the water budget that their gardens, lawns or fields need. Like UCSC, Santa Cruz High School no longer has enough water to keep all its grass athletic fields going. “It just shows how far reaching the drought has gone,” says football coach Jesse Trumbull. “There is nowhere that’s not affected.” His team was displaced from its home field after it turned into “a desert”, he says, and physical education classes normally held on it were canceled. A dying sports field isn’t just brown and ugly; it’s also a safety concern. “Without proper irrigation, the ground gets really hard,” says Kevin “Skippy” Givens, a supervisor in the physical education, recreation and sports office at UCSC. “You’re playing on something almost as hard as concrete.” When players get tackled or go down, they’re more likely to suffer a concussion or shoulder or knee injuries, he says. At UCSC, cutting back on all irrigation uses, including a 45% reduction on the main athletic field, was key to meeting the college’s water conservation goal, says water and energy manager Patrick Testoni. The downside of the field closure is that intramural softball is canceled. And five competitive sports clubs that were also displaced, including men’s soccer and women’s rugby, are now being squeezed onto the remaining, smaller athletic field – or shifted off-campus to the city’s already crowded playing fields, which are also being watered less than usual and may not stand up to the added wear and tear. While some California cities and school districts have converted their irrigation systems to tap into a recycled water source, others have put in artificial turf fields to save on maintenance and water costs. UCSC is considering synthetic turf, but it’s much hotter and requires careful cleaning to prevent infections from skin abrasions, Givens says. At Santa Cruz High, plans for artificial turf in 2009 foundered when private funding fell through. Earlier this year, the school decided to focus its outdoor irrigation on its spring baseball and softball fields and skip watering the football field, which died. After it was deemed unsafe for play in August, the school obtained a waiver from the city to increase its outdoor water allotment, and then put all of it into reviving the parched field. But the turf still needs a lot of work before it’s fully restored, says athletic director Erik Redding. He doubts it will be ready before January, when soccer starts. Meanwhile, the football team has been practicing on the baseball field, and playing “home” games on a rival school’s artificial turf. “They’re not necessarily always lovin’ it, but they’ve kind of troopered through it,” Trumbull says of the players. With the California drought now entering its fourth year, school and college athletes in Santa Cruz are not the only ones taking a hit. At the end of September the city of Pleasanton, 60 miles to the north, shut down its two dried-out football fields in Ken Mercer Park, moving its youth football program elsewhere.  In nearby Tracy, on the western edge of the Central Valley, the baseball and softball fields at Kimball High School died in early 2014 due to scarce rainfall during a routine seasonal cutoff of water deliveries from November through March by the local irrigation district. To avoid the same predicament next year, the school district is negotiating to secure water supplies through this winter – and plans to drill its own well on the Kimball property in the spring. Drought-stricken, football-crazed Texas has faced similar struggles, with the city of Dallas closing more than 20 of its athletic fields in 2011. Some towns did everything they could to keep their dying school football fields alive, such as trucking in treated wastewater for irrigation, says Robert Mace, deputy executive administrator at the Texas Water Development Board in Austin. “If we hear that a community has stopped watering their football field, then we know it’s a pretty serious development with their water supply,” he says. Back at UCSC, a disappointed Lauren Porter had been hoping that this would be the year when her soccer group would finally be recognized as a university-sanctioned competitive sport. Instead, with the main athletic field closed, her team is reduced to holding practices on a lawn outside one of the dormitories as it searches for a field where it can run tryouts and hold matches. “We’re not really sure what we’re going to do,” she says in frustration. “I never really imagined it would get to this point.” This story was produced by the Food and Environment Reporting Network, an independent non-profit news organization focusing on food, agriculture and environmental health.

"The prize-winning gourds are bigger than ever and the festivals still draw huge crowds, but California may have reached peak pumpkin. Farmers defied a crippling drought to produce monster versions of the Halloween staple, but the overall number of pumpkins appears to be shrinking. The Half Moon Bay Art &amp; Pumpkin Festival – the “Super Bowl of weigh-offs” - recently set a north American record with a 2,058lb gourd, but the number of entries fell from about 50 in previous years to 30, festival spokesman Tim Beeman said. “That is for sure because of the drought. If your water allowance is cut, then you grow fewer pumpkins.” A three-year drought has parched California, the biggest producer after Illinois, and triggered water restrictions in many areas. Pumpkins need a lot of water. “Drought is hurting the whole state. I may not grow next year if there is no water,” said Pete Glasier, 84, a Napa grower whose 2,036lb gourd set a record earlier this month at a Morgan Hill farm weigh-in until eclipsed by Half Moon Bay’s winner. “You can do a rain dance for us.” John Muller, a pumpkin grower who serves on the Half Moon Bay city council, warned that another dry winter could trigger draconian water cutbacks. In Britain, by contrast, heavy October rain has turned pumpkins soft and soggy, leaving hundreds of thousands rotting in the fields – the worst season in a decade, according to growers.  California’s record-breaking mega-pumpkins belied the state’s drought because growers sacrificed multiplicity for size – and glory. Weigh-in competitions around the state draw hundreds of thousands of people and spur innovation among growers.     Boys run through a pumpkin patch in Half Moon Bay. Photograph: Stephen McLaren/Guardian    Half Moon Bay’s inaugural winner 41 years ago weighed 150lbs, andever since, entries have grown heavier, said Beeman, thanks to improved seed genetics, cross-pollination, watering, nutrients and compost. “They’ve perfected the craft and science of growing huge pumpkins. They’re like mad scientists.” Glasier grew the 2,036lb gourd in his back yard, using about 30 to 40 gallons of Napa city water a day. Water rationing may curb him next season, but he is confident other growers will advance. “We’ll probably see a 2,500lb pumpkin in the next five years.” Doug Perry, who owns a 91-acre farm near Facebook’s headquarters in Silicon Valley, prefers to grow lots of ordinary pumpkins rather than a few that could rival a Ford Fiesta in weight. “Giant pumpkins take up too much time. You have to practically sleep with them,” he said. Perry, 60, uses water-efficient drip irrigation and is fortunate to have his own well but has still whittled his crop. “If you have water, you grow. If you haven’t, you don’t. It’s kind of a tough deal.” Pumpkins are vulnerable to pests, humidity and drought, but Perry discovered their cultural resilience a few years ago when he decided to switch crops – and upset families who used to visit his farm. “We took a year off the pumpkin and talk about chaos. The community let us know they really wanted this back. Coming to a pumpkin patch is part of people’s lives. They do it as a family. It’s an event.” California’s pumpkin community expressed bafflement at last week’s riot at a pumpkin festival in Keene, New Hampshire, which saw fires, clashes with police, 30 injures and 84 arrests.  “Here’s it’s a great community of growers,” said Glasier, who lost the record for the heaviest gourd to a fellow Napa grower, John Hawkley. Rivalry was strong but friendly, he said. “We try to keep things peaceful. We don’t want to create any acrimony or hard feelings. Some of my best friends grow pumpkins. I’m good friends with John.”",2014-10-24T14:38:58Z,Drought threatens monster gourds at California's pumpkin Super Bowl,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""e0f461e73eccc859fc2840af56401e09b1595b7f""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414160343247/3d455c21-1c04-42c4-95a5-1ebbac5c87f8-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Giant pumpkins, California"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A three-year drought has parched California, the biggest producer after Illinois, and triggered water restrictions in many areas.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Stephen McLaren/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>",86,Entries in the Half Moon Bay’s ‘Super Bowl of weigh-offs’ reduced as crippling drought triggers water restrictions,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414160343956/3d455c21-1c04-42c4-95a5-1ebbac5c87f8-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/24/california-pumpkin-drought-growers-haf-moon-bay,3,negative
"This year the Halloween Jack-o’-lanterns on Californian doorsteps are likely to be considerably smaller than usual. Like many other crops, pumpkins are suffering from California’s crippling three-year drought, which has cost the state $2.2 billion in 2014 alone. Now a new study shows that it may have been caused by the same atmospheric phenomenon that triggered the devastating decade-long “Dust Bowl” drought of the 1930s. Starting in 1934, the dust bowl drought left nearly three-quarters of the western United States utterly parched and forced tens of thousands of families to abandon their farms. Using tree ring data, sea surface temperatures and rainfall records, Benjamin Cook from NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies and colleagues have reconstructed the last one thousand years of North American droughts, and shown that the dust bowl drought really was exceptional. The findings, which are published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, reveal that the dust bowl was around seven times larger than other major North American droughts in the last millennium, and nearly 30 per cent worse than the continent’s next most severe drought, which occurred in 1580. But Cook and his colleagues also found that the trigger for the dust bowl – a high pressure ridge over the west coast during winter, which deflects rain-laden storms – is also responsible for the current Californian drought, and the 1976 drought (one of the most severe in the state’s history). However, the current drought is unlikely to turn into a repeat of the dust bowl, as better agricultural practices are helping to limit wind erosion and reducing the likelihood of dust storms.

"    Sharron Hope has been a dowser since 1997. Markedly cheaper than hiring a hydrogeologist - which can cost as much as $50,000 - Hope offers her services for around $500 a consultation. Video: Mary Catherine O’Connor     Outside of a farmhouse on a 1,800-acre organic dairy farm near Oroville, California, Sharron Hope bends over a printout of a Google Earth map, holding a small jade Buddha pendant. The map shows a small section of the farm to the east, and Hope is hunting for water. As the pendant swings, she notes a subtle change in motion that, she says, indicates she has found some.  Is there any significance to the jade? No, she says, I just like it. Plus, she adds, “I figure Buddha’s gotta know.”  Hope is a water dowser, or someone who uses intuition, energy vibrations and divining rods or pendulums to mark the best spots for wells.  As California rounds the corner towards a four-year historic drought, many farmers and vintners have become completely reliant on groundwater. After divvying surface water allotments to satisfy urban, ecosystem and industrial needs, farmers in many parts of the state received little or no irrigation water from state agencies this year. In a normal year, allotments would cover roughly two-thirds of farmers’ needs.     Sharron Hope, a water dowser in California, uses a jade pendant to locate underground water on a map. Photograph: Mary Catherine O'Connor    Under these severe drought conditions, the success or failure of a well can mean the success or failure of a farm or vineyard, so before the drill bit hits the dirt, landowners need an educated guess as to where to find the most productive well site on their property. To get that, they can call in a professional hydrogeologist, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars – or they can drop a fraction of the cost on a dowser, such as Hope. Despite a distinct lack of empirical evidence regarding dowsers’ efficacy, demand is high and dowsers’ phones are ringing off the hook.  “I’ve gotten far more calls this year from farmers looking for a water dowser than in most years,” says Sacramento-based Donna Alhers, who heads the Sierra Dowsers, a chapter of the American Society of Dowsers.  Water dowsers from around the state are also seeing a spike in demand. “I’m getting a lot of calls from people whose wells have run dry,” Hope says. Where did dowsing come from?  The exact origins of dowsing are murky, but its roots can be traced back as far as the Middle Ages. The practice, sometimes used by miners and fortune seekers, was reportedly condemned in the 16th century as the work of the devil. Today, dowsers hail from one of two camps. Some have agrarian backgrounds, and learned the practice from ancestors who used it to locate good sites for wells on their own or their neighbors’ farms. The second group hails from the New Age movement and tend to be devotees of a wide range of mystical practices and “energy work”.  Traditionally, dowsing has been used not just to find groundwater, but also minerals and natural gas. Many dowsers claim they can dowse anything, from lost items or pets to criminals on the lam. You name it, they say they can divine it. Hope began dowsing for water in 1977 after learning about the practice from Walter Woods, a science teacher at Butte College, where she was a student. Woods had learned dowsing from his father, a farmer, and eventually became a well-known authority on dowsing. He authored a widely read dowsing primer, Letter to Robin, and served as president of the American Society of Dowsers. Woods taught Hope to scan for signs of groundwater by observing the landscape and looking for signs like deer trails. “Deer have magnetite in their pineal gland [an endocrine gland in the brain]. As water moves underground, electrons are stripped out and move to the surface,” Hope says. “Deer can sense it and tend to walk along that vein of underground water toward a spring.” Dowsing is based on the premise that humans can tap into that energy, too, using instruments such as branches and pendulums. Energy marks the spot After Hope finishes with the map, she heads out to the spots she has marked, walking the land and searching for very faint energy markings over the landscape, which she’ll use more talismans to locate. She begins a general scan of the area with a forked pine branch, holding the ends in her hands and sweeping it through the air. Despite scientific evidence, Hope believes that the branch she holds channels the energy emitted by submerged water. Once she homes in on the most promising region (which matches, as it turns out, the area she had marked on the map) she trades the branch for what are known in the dowsing world as “L-rods”, two long metal bars with a short handle and long extension, forming an L.     Sharron Hope works as a dowser in California’s Central Valley. Here she uses a pine branch to lead her to to a potential well site. Photograph: Mary Catherine O'Connor    Hope holds these in front of her, with her elbows at 90 degrees, and walks slowly up – and then laterally along – the rise. As the long ends of the bars begin to fall away from each other, she stops.  The energy moving up from the groundwater, she says, creates a field that L-rods respond to. This, she says, marks the edge of the underground stream. She then traverses the hillside, down slope, and stops again when the bars cross in front of her. This, she explains, marks the spot where two veins of groundwater cross over each other, making it a potentially very productive well site. “I have goosebumps,” Hope says with a smile. “I feel the energy moving up from the ground.” Although Hope and other dowsers often refer to underground veins and streams, USGS hydrologist Ralph Health, in a highly cited report on groundwater basics, says the vast majority of groundwater is found in relatively still aquifers. Swiftly moving streams are quite rare. Water, water everywhere Out in the field, Hope locates three possible well sites in roughly 30 minutes. She decides that the third is the best option, even though she doesn’t think it has the strongest flow rate, because it is relatively shallow at 200 feet (about 61 meters) below ground and is the most accessible and flat option. Daley stakes the spot and the dowsing is done. Daley is now awaiting drilling permits, and once those come through, she’ll call in a local driller. “I have about 90% accuracy,” Hope claims, meaning that 90% of the sites she recommends produce water. This actually isn’t that surprising, hydrogeologists say. “Dowsers may seem convincing, but when [their practice is] exposed to scientific review, groundwater is very prevalent, so it’s hard to miss it when you drill a well,” says Ted Johnson, chief hydrogeologist for the Water Replenishment District of Southern California and president of the board of the Groundwater Resources Association of California. “When you use science to site a well, you can test for quality, depth and how long [the flow] will last.” To site a well, hydrogeologists will review driller well logs from the Department of Water Resources and geologic maps that show areas of alluvial soils, under which groundwater is most likely to accumulate. To really zero in on well sites, they drill a test well, which produces cuttings of the various strata. They then test for each layer’s ability to transport water. It’s a time-consuming and expensive process. Because a landowner is unlikely to hire both a dowser and a hydrogeologist to see who finds the best-producing well (though that could make for some mildly entertaining reality television), the two groups coexist and generally ignore each other, aside from tossing verbal jabs.  “I’m a scientist and I’ve been trained on scientific principles, and that’s what I use [to locate groundwater],” says Tim Parker, a hydrogeologist and independent consultant based in Sacramento. “There’s no scientific evidence that dowsing is more effective than random chance.” Of cash and crops So why are so many farmers turning to dowsers instead of hydrologists? Part of it’s probably the money: dowsers might charge $1,000 (Hope charges most of her clients around $500, and less for a small residential well), while a big consulting firm costs $10,000 to $50,000, Johnson says. “All a farmer cares about is getting the groundwater,” he says.  But Cynthia Daley, who hired Sharron Hope to dowse for a well on her dairy farm, says it’s not about costs. “Dowsing is based on energy and it is something that the scientific community has not embraced, but I’m not arrogant enough to think science knows everything – and I am a scientist; I have a PhD,” she says.  Whether farmers and vintners are using dowsers merely as a result of their relative affordability or out of a strong belief in the practice is hard to, well, divine. What is clear is that the popularity of dowsing is growing, not just in the Central Valley, but throughout the state. Daley, who has degrees in animal science with a doctorate in endocrinology, is a professor in the College of Agriculture at nearby California State University at Chico, where she runs an organic dairy program. She is developing an organic dairy operation on her property, which is why she’s drilling wells. “Everyone I know who has had wells put in around here has used dowsers.” Many more wells are springing up. State agencies from counties around California are issuing twice – and sometimes three times as many – well drilling permits this summer than last summer, according to the Associated Press. Keeping Marc Mondavi busy Marc Mondavi, grandson of Napa Valley wine pioneer Cesare Mondavi and a longtime dowser, says that he can’t keep up with the demand: “I’m doing anywhere from two to four projects a week and I’m backlogged, and drillers around here are backlogged for three to five months.”  Mondavi uses dowsing not only as a revenue stream, but also as a means of marketing his own brand, The Divining Rod. He doesn’t shy away from the name “water witch”, a term other dowsers consider pejorative. His daughter Alycia Mondavi even made a short promo video called “My Dad is a Witch.” He acknowledges it’s hard not to strike groundwater, but says that using his intuitive dowsing skills allows him to find the best spots, especially as the drought depletes the water table. “No matter where you drill, you might hit [a flow of] four gallons per minute,” he says. “In those areas maybe I can find eight to 10 gallons per minute.” The dowsing divide might persist for decades to come, but there is plenty of indisputable evidence that groundwater is being overtaxed as the drought drags on. Amplifying the problem of groundwater scarcity, policy experts say, is a lack of regulation. That looks likely to change. Governor Brown is expected to sign one of three separate groundwater regulation bills currently sitting on his desk. Some agriculture groups, including the Agriculture Council of California and Blue Diamond Growers, have rallied against the bills, saying they will drive up costs for already cash-strapped farmers and deny long-held water rights.  But Daley says groundwater is too important to remain unchecked. “We have to regulate it. It’s a very important resource.”  Until that happens, however, sun-baked farmers will keep digging for rain.

"The financial implications of a yes vote for Scottish independence came under intense scrutiny as home owners were warned it would be harder get a mortgage and Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group made plans to move to London if the electorate backed a breakaway from the UK.The revelations about the contingency plans by the two banks – which employ thousands of people in Scotland – to set up legal entities in England came after Scottish homebuyers were facing warnings it could be harder to obtain a mortgage in the event of a yes vote.The bosses of two major companies – BP and Standard Life – had also voiced their concerns about the impact of a yes vote even before details emerged of the plans being made by the two bailed-out banks to move their crucial legal status if the referendum on 18 September backed Alex Salmond's independence campaign.In a statement issued last night, Lloyds – which owns Bank of Scotland and is 25% owned by taxpayers – spelled out its contingency arrangements, which would be likely to involve moving its registered office from Scotland, where its Halifax Bank of Scotland business is registered. ""While the scale of potential change is currently unclear, we have contingency plans in place which include the establishment of new legal entities in England,"" it said.""This is a legal procedure and there would be no immediate changes or issues which could affect our business or our customers,"" added Lloyds, which is the largest private sector employer in Scotland with 17,000 staff.The Treasury said the decision was understandable and Treasury sources said RBS was making similar preparations. ""The government is not making contingency plans for a yes vote,"" a Treasury spokesman said. RBS is thought to be making a statement on Thursday.David Nish, the Standard Life chief executive, said: ""Standard Life has a long history in Scotland – a heritage of which we are very proud and we hope that this continues – but our responsibility is to protect the interests of our customers, our shareholders, our people and other stakeholders in our business.""Bob Dudley, the BP boss who has faced criticism for not speaking out enough on the critical issue of oil, said the future prospects for the North Sea would be best served if the UK stayed together because ""future long-term investments require fiscal stability and certainty"".The intentions of the two banks – bailed out with £65bn of taxpayer funds – came after Bank of England governor Mark Carney had endured intense scrutiny about the financial implications for an independent Scotland by MPs on the Treasury select committee.He had stressed Threadneedle Street had contingency plans in the face of concerns about capital flight from Scotland and indicated that a Scottish central bank could need at least 25%, and possibly more than 100%, of the nation's GDP in reserves if Salmond decides to use sterling after independence without the support of Westminster.Banks are also thought to be devising other contingency plans. One source said they may transport more bank notes to Scotland to ""ensure appropriate liquidity"" if customers want to withdraw more cash in the event of a yes vote.One housing industry insider said there has already been an impact on the housing market, with signs that the market for homes worth more than £600,000 – the top end of the market in Scotland – is drying up. At the same time, commercial property deals were being put on hold until the vote was known – and could be abandoned in the event of a yes vote.Some potential property buyers have inserted clauses into their offers saying ""subject to a no vote"", according to the mortgage broker Ray Boulger of John Charcol. He said: ""A yes vote will create massive problems in terms of how mortgages are denominated and regulated. We expect it to be much more difficult for Scottish borrowers to get mortgages post a yes vote.""Other bankers are speaking of a pause in lending until the situation is clear.Lenders are refusing to comment publicly for fear of being accused of playing politics. But one said: ""Before that poll [the Sunday Times/YouGov poll that showed the yes campaign in the lead] it was interesting but not critical. Now we are watching things very, very closely. It – introduces huge uncertainty and one way of decreasing our exposure and risk would be to reduce the loan-to-value offered to borrowers.""However, another lender with significant operations in Scotland said it expected business to resume as usual, even in the event of a yes vote.David Hollingworth, at mortgage broker London &amp; Country, said one of the key issues involved how Scottish mortgages lent by English banks and building societies would be regulated in the event of a yes vote. He said: ""If it starts getting more and more complicated in terms of currency, regulation and so on, is it going to be something lenders adapt to, or are they actually going to turn their back on that market? Certainly, some smaller lenders could decide on the latter. The larger ones may well stick with it.""The precise amount of reserves need to back an independent Scotland will depended on the size of the banking sector, at least 10 times the size of Scottish GDP.There had been mounting expectations that banks would shift their registered offices to seek the protection of the Bank of England – to protect customers and the bank's all-important credit ratings.The governor promised to provide a detailed analysis to the committee this morning of his comments on the approach taken by other countries and Andrew Tyrie, the Tory MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, seized on Carney's remarks about the reserves Scotland would need to support the use of sterling without Westminster's permission.""Today the governor clarified that, whatever currency arrangement is chosen, Scotland would require much higher reserves than it could inherit as a share of UK assets.""That would leave a very big shortfall. As the governor said, meeting this shortfall would mean 'real fiscal costs' for Scotland – almost certainly higher taxes or spending cuts.""Carney told the Treasury select committee that the Bank of England had contingency plans in place if Scotland votes on 18 September to go it alone. Several economists have warned that savers and companies could rush to move their money out of Scotland. The governor told MPs: ""There are reasons why we have -contingency plans in place"".Giving few details, Carney said that in the immediate aftermath of a yes vote, financial institutions would continue to be offered Bank of England support and depositors would be protected by the existing Financial Services Compensation Scheme. In line with EU rules, that scheme covers £85,000 of savings in a single institution.",2014-09-10T22:34:00Z,Banks say: we'll leave Scotland if the independence vote is a yes,,89,"RBS and Lloyds Banking Group warn of possible relocation to London, if Scottish voters back breakaway from the UK",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/10/1410364553223/Georgian-Charlotte-Square-006.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/10/scottish-independence-create-mortgage-drought,2,negative
"The arid and semi-arid lands (ASAL) of Kenya are among the poorest and most vulnerable regions of the world. In Kenya’s ASALs, drought is the most pervasive hazard, encountered by households on a widespread level. More than three million pastoralist households are regularly hit by increasingly severe droughts, costing the economy an estimated $12.1bn between 2008 and 2011. For livelihoods that rely mainly on livestock, the high livestock mortality rate caused by drought has devastating effects, rendering these pastoralists among the most vulnerable populations in Kenya. As the impacts of climate change unfold, the link between drought risk, vulnerability and poverty becomes significantly stronger. Over the past several years, the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), in collaboration with Cornell University and technical partners, has pursued a research program aimed at designing, developing and implementing insurance products to protect livestock keepers from drought-related asset losses. Using satellite imagery to assess the amount of forage available, Index-Based Livestock Insurance (IBLI) provides insured pastoralists with a pay-out in times of drought based on predicted rather than actual livestock deaths. In order to launch IBLI as a commercial product, ILRI and Takaful Insurance of Africa came together in August 2013 to offer a sharia-compliant version of IBLI in Wajir County with plans of expansion into other areas of northern Kenya later this year. As a sharia compliant product, Takaful does not go against the teachings of Islam and is guided by the principles of improved welfare for all. For example, it offers mutual or “community insurance”, whereby the insurer charges a set fee, rather than applying interest, which in sharia-law can be seen as a form of gambling. The CEO of Takaful Insurance of Africa, Hassan Bashir, was born into a cattle-herding Somali family, and as Kenya’s first sharia-compliant insurance company, he wanted to solve his community’s biggest problem – the loss of livestock due to drought. Takaful requires that those who need protection participate in a risk pooling scheme. Fund participants are grouped into geographically defined areas that have a set contribution based on local pasture conditions and they receive an indemnity when predicted livestock mortality from drought rises above the trigger level. One of the biggest challenges facing Index Based Livestock Takaful (IBLT) is consumer education to catalyse demand. The communities in the target areas have low written literacy levels, radio coverage is limited to near town centres, and mobile phone coverage can be sporadic. Finally, as a pastoral population, worse weather means that more members of the community are trekking with their animals to find better pasture, which impacts who is available to purchase. This situation is further compounded by the fact that these communities have had little or no prior experience with insurance. It takes them time to trust the product and overcome their preconceived notions of its compliance with sharia law. Further, due to low levels of liquidity, pastoralists must often consider selling an animal in order to pay for the premium. As a result, many pastoralists buy small, less expensive contracts for “shoats” (sheeps &amp; goats) to test the product before they pay the more expensive premiums for cattle and camels. Nevertheless, the scheme has had its successes. In March 2014, all 101 policyholders received a payout for a low level of drought in the area and sales between August/September 2013 and January/February 2014 grew by 138% with the expense ratio to Takaful Insurance decreasing by 100%. In order for IBLT to reach scale and commercial sustainability, plans are underway to expand across the Greater Horn of Africa starting with Somalia, as Takaful Insurance has recently opened offices in Mogadishu and Hargeisa. Critical distribution infrastructure, such as mobile phone coverage and mobile money, as well as FM radio coverage is almost complete in areas of Takaful Insurance’s operation. So far, the Index-Based Livestock Insurance program has been linked to a 50% drop in ‘distress’ sales of livestock to raise cash in times of drought, a 33% reduced likelihood of having to eat significantly smaller meals and a 33% reduction in dependence on food aid. Leading research body CGIAR recently announced that it will dedicate at least 60% of its one $1bn annual budget to reaching more vulnerable people with climate-smart initiatives such as Index-Based Livestock Insurance. The impacts seen in Kenya could be scaled up, but given the infrastructural and other challenges of east Africa’s drylands, it is not yet clear whether an IBLI product can be entirely commercially viable without subsidy support. Despite this, and even though IBLI does not offer complete protection against herd loss, it is a promising option for addressing poverty traps that arise from catastrophic drought risk. Uptake has had a range of benefits for those insured, including improved wellbeing and a reduction in drastic coping strategies when drought strikes.

"Today some 2.8 billion people face insufficient supplies of fresh water, and according to the United Nations that number is set to increase to half the world’s population by 2030. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports that 40% of the world’s food depends on irrigation, which accounts for almost 70% of fresh water used.It makes sense then that farmers are turning to new and old technology in an attempt to manage their water. Measure twice, pump once The old business dogma, “If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it”, holds especially true with water usage. But in many places around the world the amount of water diverted from rivers or pumped from the ground to irrigate crops is not measured. Even California groundwater was totally unregulated until this month. That’s a political rather than a technological problem, said Peter Gleick, co-founder of the Pacific Institute, an independent research organization focused on water issues. Flow meters to measure water use are neither new nor expensive, Gleick said. But in many places groundwater has long been considered a property right, so farmers have seen no need measure or justify how they use it. But with drought and over-pumping dropping water tables, some are beginning to recognize that better water use tracking will help to keep a dwindling resource flowing.  Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based Wellntel, a water technology company, is answering that need with a water-measuring system that uses sound sensors to detect the water level in a well – without touching the water or opening the well. The sensors transmit data to the Wellntel website, where customers can log in to private accounts and see their water level at various points: when pumping, after rainfall, and over time. In an attempt to mollify farmers, Wellntel specifically touts a farmer’s right not to share data on the amount of water used with anyone else. Waste not, want not The first place to save water is in conveyance: as much as 60% of the water withdrawn for irrigation is lost through leaks in canals, spillage and evaporation, according to the FAO. Another part of the problem is flood irrigation – the most common method of field irrigation globally. About half the water on flood irrigated fields isn’t absorbed by crops, according to the US Geological Survey. Instead it runs off, taking with it fertilizers, pesticides and topsoil that pollute water bodies around the world and cause dead zones, areas where too much fertilizer causes algae to bloom, which in turn sucks oxygen out of the water, killing other life. Flood irrigation is commonplace because it’s cheap. But in response to strained water supplies, some farmers have made the shift to much more efficient underground irrigation or precision micro-sprinkler and drip irrigation systems that deposit tiny amounts of water directly above the roots of crops. These systems also help farmers earn more money by allowing them to plan more acreage while using less water than before. The up-front cost of a drip system is significant – about $500 to $1000 per acre, according to the FAO. Even though these investments pay for themselves within a few years thanks to better water-use efficiency and lower irrigation-related energy bills, many farmers don’t have the cash – or credit access – to install them. However a Middle Eastern firm has developed a new low-tech solution that also places water right at the roots of crops and can work with or without drip irrigation – and comes with a much smaller price tag. In Israel, where water scarcity has been a way of life for decades, Tal-Ya (“God’s dew” in Hebrew) manufactures trays that capture dew and funnel it to plants, often tree crops. The 28- by 22-inch polypropylene trays trap air underneath themselves as well, insulating plants from extreme temperatures and catching moisture evaporating from the earth to create a perpetually moist soil pocket around the roots. They also block weeds that would otherwise compete with crops for water. Each tray costs $3 to $5 apiece. Mickey Chesla, Tal-Ya’s vice president of marketing and sales, said the trays can reduce water use by up to 90% although 50% is more typical. They can also reduce fertilizer use by 30% because the trays direct the nutrient straight to the plant’s roots. While introducing more plastic into the environment might not seem like a great idea, Tal-Ya states that its trays last for up to 10 years and are 100% recyclable. Since beginning commercial production in 2013, farmers in Israel, the United States, China, Chile, Georgia, Sri Lanka, and Australia have adopted them according to the company’s web site. This past spring Tal-Ya was a runner-up in the Imagine H20 food and agriculture competition. Its tray system “improves agricultural yields without increasing resource allocation”, said Scott Bryan, Imagine H2O’s chief operating officer. “These solutions that enable farmers to produce more with less are proving crucial to surviving the California drought,” he said. Just in time Another way to avoid waste is to avoid watering when it’s about to rain or the soil is still moist. A variety of systems – including Measure-Tek, Ranch Systems and Pure Sense – use weather-monitoring stations and soil moisture probes that send data via radio or cellular signals to a grower’s computer or smart phone. Some can be programmed to turn irrigation off and on as needed. Taking this concept to the extreme, Oakland, California-based Fruition Sciences has created a web application that crunches data from more than 40 sensors to determine whether crops need more water. The system tracks crop nutrient uptake, aerial photos, and weather and soil conditions. One special sensor tracks sap flowing through grapevines. “People are overwatering,” said Thibaut Scholasch, founder and vice president of research and development for the company. “Everywhere we go, from Spain to Argentina to California to Italy to France, we measure a plant response showing that vines are much more resilient than we think.” “We are teaching people to un-train their eyes: drippy-looking leaves do not mean the plant needs water”, Scholasch said. “Often it simply means the weather is hot even if there is still plenty of water in the root system.” Fruition Sciences is working with farmers in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Water District on a project to save water. “So far we have saved anywhere from 40% to 100% of water used for irrigation,” Scholasch said. The range reflects a big swing in how much a grower is over-irrigating as well as the spatial variability and climate dryness of a given vineyard. The systems aren’t cheap however. Costs range from $40 to $5,000 for a “site” which can be as large as 50 acres – if the field is planted with a single crop – but is often much smaller.  The expense has so far limited the appeal of Fruition Sciences’ system to use with wine grapes. But Scholasch said the firm is currently testing the technology with other cash crops. From restraint to reuse An even more nuanced way to manage watering is a strategy called regulated deficit irrigation. The goal is to irrigate crops just enough to maximize crop-water productivity by reducing irrigation at the point of diminishing returns. For example, reducing water by 50% might result in a yield reduction of just 10%. Some crops, such as wine grapes and certain nuts, actually benefit from water stress during drought-tolerant life stages. Regulated deficit irrigation can be implemented with any type of irrigation system. It is sometimes used with rain-fed crops, adding a bit of irrigation during droughts or in sensitive growth stages, such as when the plants are producing vegetation and during final ripening.  Reuse is also growing in appeal, with urban wastewater being lightly treated and directed to landscaping, industry, power plant cooling, groundwater recharge – and crop irrigation.  “In Monterey and Salinas Valley, much of the strawberries and artichokes are grown with recycled wastewater effluent,” said David Sedlak, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California at Berkeley. A new technology from Calgary-based Livestock Water Recycling is treating animal waste for reuse on row crops in what amounts to a little sewage treatment plant. The nutrients in the treated sewage benefit the crops by reducing the need for fertilizer inputs, and reduce pollutant runoff because the plants absorb some of the nutrients.  It’s an improvement over the common lagoon system, in which waste sits in a pool for multiple months, to allow solids to settle out before being sprayed on crops. These pools emit toxic gases and can leak into nearby water bodies. Farmers can also capture flood irrigation runoff and reuse it. This kind of reuse is easier and more cheaply done in organic farming, where the water contains fewer fertilizers and pesticides, than in more conventional agriculture. And dry-land farmers have developed many strategies to collect rain via barrels and cisterns for direct use, and to resupply groundwater using bioswales (land features that filter water), buffer strips, off-stream storage reservoirs and natural wetlands. Right-cropping Not all countries or regions may be able to be self-sufficient in food production. Fifty-one percent of the world’s population may rely on food imports in 2050, according to a study last year in Environmental Research Letters. Certain crops need less water and are well suited to dry environments, whereas others such as rice, cotton, or alfalfa – notoriously thirsty crops – are probably better left to wetter regions. Choosing to grow the right crops for the climate – right-cropping – is important in making the most of available water. Countries in the Persian Gulf are turning increasingly to international food imports after decades of depleting their groundwater. Israel, too, is spending more of its limited water resources on industries other than agriculture, earning money to buy food internationally. “There may be no countries in the Middle East that have enough water to be self-sufficient in agriculture,” said Gleick of the Pacific Institute. However, some countries are buying land in wetter countries to grow their food, a practice that can jeopardize local food security, environmental justice and human rights. A study last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found land grabbing inextricably linked to gaining water rights, with 60% taken by the United States, the United Arab Emirates, India, the United Kingdom, Egypt, China and Israel. Forty-seven percent of such land purchases occurred in Africa and 33% in Asia. There is also a growing debate over whether some non-food crops should be grown at all in an increasingly water-scarce world. Feedstocks for biofuels, for example, take hundreds of gallons of water per gallon of fuel to produce. The International Energy Agency predicts a 317% percent increase in water consumption by biofuel crops by 2035.  Happy soil, happy plant life While modern industrial agriculture has tended to treat soil merely as a medium that props up plants – first bombing it with insecticides and pesticides, then applying fertilizer to pump up the plants – healthy soil has built-in plant nutrients, absorbs water more deeply and retains it better. Many traditional agricultural practices – such as reduced tillage, crop rotation, planting cover crops, applying compost, manure, or mulch – nurture the microscopic critters that live in soil. But ways to increase soil moisture and water efficiency are also coming to conventional farming.Polymer soil additions have been researched for 20 years as a means to help soil retain moisture. The idea is that when the farmer irrigates, the polymer absorbs water that would otherwise run off and holds it around the seed.  Bay Area-based mOasis, which produces a soil polymer called BountiGel, claims its product is a significant advance on this concept: it doesn’t break down before the plant can use it, said Steven Hartmeier, mOasis’ CEO. But it does break down. It’s harmless to soil microorganisms because it is highly diluted in the soil at about 10 parts per million, he said. Made of ingredients already approved for human use and consumption, BountiGel has been approved for use by the California Department of Food and Agriculture. Roda Group, a venture capital firm based in Berkeley, Calif., has invested more than $5m in mOasis.  In use the polymer has shown the potential for 25% higher crop yields due to decreased stress on plants, 25% reduced water use overall, and 15% savings on water-related energy utilities, Hartmeier said. “We had a tomato grower this year that would normally drip-irrigate every seven days, and with our product, they stretched it out nine to 11 days.” Although BountiGel costs about $150 an acre, an average grower can generate about $900 more per acre thanks to increased yield and water savings, according Hartmeier. The farmers he works with, like farmers nearly everywhere around the world, “need to figure out how to grow more with less water”, Hartmeier said. “We have a water problem in California, and it’s not going away.”  This article was amended 29 September to correct the spelling of mOasis CEO Steven Hartmeier’s name.

"Grapevines march across wires strung along rolling hills, their little trunks improbably supporting heavy black fruit. Cindy Steinbeck’s family has been farming this land in central California since 1920. The family grows zinfandel, viognier, cabernet, merlot and petite syrah grapes, and is best known for a blend called The Crash, named after a remarkable incident in 1956, when a B-26 crash-landed 200 yards from the family home. Four of the five Air Force men aboard survived, bailing out in the nearby fields. Now a new crash threatens, as groundwater levels beneath the vineyards plummet. Amid one of the worst droughts ever recorded ­­– with more than 80% of the state in extreme or exceptional drought – Steinbeck Vineyards’ 520 acres of grapes have been growing well, thanks to the family’s access to up to 2 acre-feet ­– about 652,000 gallons – of groundwater per acre per season. The Steinbecks have been able to tap this subterranean resource at will from the Paso Robles groundwater basin because they own the land above it — and because California, which produces nearly half of US-grown fruits, nuts and vegetables, is the only western state without groundwater regulation. But that boon to farmers is also a looming disaster. Groundwater makes up a huge piece of the state’s water supply, meeting approximately 40% of its water demands in an average year and 60% or more during droughts, according to the state’s water resources department. And groundwater is part of a larger hydrological system: excessive groundwater pumping can empty aquifers faster than natural systems can replenish them; dry up nearby wells; allow saltwater intrusion; and draw down water supplies from rivers, lakes and streams. Taking so much water out of the soil can cause the dirt to compact and the land to sink, an action called subsidence. Land can subside as much as a foot a year in the face of aggressive pumping, destroying infrastructure such as irrigation canals, building foundations, roads, bridges and pipelines. “In the absence of governance, it’s become a pumping arms race,” said Felicia Marcus, chair of the State Water Resources Control Board. “He with the biggest pump or deepest straw wins.” Now, California looks set to regulate groundwater for the first time. The state senate and assembly last week passed two bills, SB-1168 and AB-1739, authorizing local agencies to manage groundwater. Governor Jerry Brown has 30 days to sign the bills into law, and his approval seems likely, as he has supported the bills throughout the process.  The Association of California Water Agencies, a water-utilities trade group, and the California Water Foundation, a nonprofit focused on balancing California’s water needs, support the new bills. But the California Farm Bureau Federation opposes them. Danny Merkley, director of water resources for the federation, attributed groundwater supply problems not to lack of regulation, but to “inflexible, outdated environmental policies” as well as population growth and climate change.  “Groundwater management must protect the property rights of overlying landowners,” he said. “Otherwise, there could be huge, long-term economic impacts on farms because of the potential to devalue land.” Neighbors suing neighbors Even if the approved bills become law, change could come slowly. Groundwater basins would have two years to form a local management agency, five years to adopt a sustainable management plan and 20 years to achieve a sustainable supply of groundwater. It’s also unclear whether the law, if approved, would help end the current spate of neighbors suing neighbors. Suing has become standard practice in California when groundwater basins are overdrafted. In these cases, a court decides who may extract how much and who will manage the basin to ensure everyone is using water according to the court’s decree, a process called adjudication. The state already has 22 adjudicated groundwater basins, according to the water resources department. Adjudication can be time-consuming and expensive for all concerned. According to the San Luis Obispo County website, for example, the Santa Maria Groundwater adjudication “is now going on its 12th year and is still in court appeals”, with a total cost of $11m and climbing. Landowners, including Steinbeck, who have historically considered water beneath their land to be part of their property rights in California, filed suit last fall against San Luis Obispo County and four municipal water companies. This summer, this and a related lawsuit have recently been transferred to San Jose, a city to the north — because everyone agrees that locals can’t be impartial. The Paso Robles groundwater basin has been declining for years, said San Luis Obispo County board of supervisors chair Bruce Gibson, but “the drought has magnified the effect.” When wells began to dry up last summer, the board passed a moratorium on new water use in the basin.  While Steinbeck sees any limitation of her family’s ability to pump and use the water under its land as “taking over our rights”, Gibson says property rights aren’t absolute. “One can do a range of activities on their property as long as it doesn’t infringe on others’ similar enjoyment of their property,” he said.  As California assemblyman Roger Dickinson, author of the assembly bill, puts it: the property rights narrative for groundwater rights “is called into question if your neighbor pumps out so much water that your well runs dry”.  Part of the problem is it’s unclear how much everyone is pumping: the state doesn’t require groundwater supplies or pumping rates to be measured today. The recently passed bill, though, would require each groundwater basin to report everyone’s pumping quantities and depth of groundwater each year, as well as to set specific objectives for stabilizing the water level at a certain elevation. As Felicia Marcus, chair of the state water board, put it: “We didn’t require meters, but we’re requiring the adequate ability to monitor.” It’s a surprisingly contentious issue. The challenge to metering groundwater “is not technological; it’s political”, said Peter Gleick, cofounder of the Pacific Institute, an independent research organization focused on water issues. “There are certain people who benefit enormously from a lack of information and inefficiency – and those people have lawyers.” How did we get here? The current groundwater crisis is part of a bigger problem. The state’s existing water laws “were never designed to deal with the challenges California now faces,” said Mike Young, who holds a research chair in water and environmental policy at the University of Adelaide in Australia.  Young speaks from experience. He played a key role in developing improved water entitlement, allocation and trading systems in Australia and won a national award for his efforts. Ultimately, he said, California needs that type of radical reform.  For one thing, like many places experiencing water stress around the world, California is using water inefficiently. “We really need to think about the demand side of the equation more than the supply side,” Gleick said. Opacity of water rights, unmeasured usage and laws with perverse incentives enable waste. California’s water rights laws are based on seniority, and in many years, there are more rights to water than actual water. “There are a lot of water claims out there and we don’t have a fully adjudicated system,” Marcus said. In fact, the state has allocated five times more surface water than the state actually has, according to a new University of California at Davis report. It’s unclear how much water some rights holders can take out, said Brian Gray, a law professor at the University of California at Hastings. For example, the most senior water rights – called riparian – are “not quantified”, he said. Also, the law has long encouraged waste. It requires water to be put to “reasonable and beneficial use”, which includes supplying cities, industry, irrigation, hydroelectric generation, livestock watering, recreation, and fish and wildlife habitat. “Reasonable use” sounds … well, reasonable, but a “use it or lose it” clause incentivizes profligate use: if you don’t use your historic water allocation in a beneficial way, you forfeit your water rights, Gray said. In addition, today farmers aren’t able to sell the water they don’t use or save the unused water for next year, said Thad Bettner, general manager of the Glenn Colusa Irrigation District. “We use what we can use and that’s it,” he said.  That’s ridiculous, Young said, adding that farmers should be rewarded – not penalized – for conservation.  Courts also should adjudicate the basins and convert all of the water rights into shares, eliminating the problem of overdrafting a watershed, he said. “You cannot give anybody a guaranteed volume,” he said. The future’s at stake Getting groundwater policy right will become increasingly important as climate change advances, potentially reducing snowpack – which has acted as a handy storehouse in California, holding winter water and releasing it slowly into summer – by 70% to 90% (pdf). More reservoirs, which the Farm Bureau advocates, won’t be enough to make up the loss, Marcus said, adding the biggest opportunity for new storage is groundwater basins, she said. The goal of the new bills is not to just stop groundwater depletion, but to create incentives to replenish these underground basins and keep them full as a water management tool. If we use groundwater basins intelligently, we can make up for snowpack by getting our act together now, she said. “It’s the state’s future at stake.” This is a condensed version of an article produced by Climate Confidential and released for re-use under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

"The Mojave desert stretches in all directions, sand and scrub as far as the eye can see, with no road or trail, no marker or signpost, to indicate that here, in the middle of a wilderness furnace, sits a swimming pool.The pristine pool, five feet deep, five feet wide and 11 feet long, is no California mirage. It is an art installation.An Austrian artist, Alfredo Barsuglia, created the sculpture, entitled Social Pool, and declared it open to the public. Before plunging in, you need to contact the MAK Centre for Art and Architecture in West Hollywood to request its secret GPS coordinates and a key to open the white cover. You must bring a gallon of water to replace evaporated water and return the key within 24 hours.The installation is a critical commentary, among other things, on California's love affair with private swimming pools. ""In a desolate and drought-hit area, a pool is something absurd,"" Barsuglia told the Observer. ""Luxury goods are status symbols – things that are expensive but not important to survival.""With droughts in much of the western US triggering water rationing and intense political battles, others are also wondering if private pools, long part of the iconography of California, and especially Los Angeles, have become anachronisms.""The swimming pool's position as status symbol and sign of health, wealth and beauty has come into question with increasing public concern over pool security, code enforcement, liability, the rising costs of maintenance and a growing awareness of the finite nature of water as a natural resource,"" said Dick Hebdige, a media studies professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who wrote an essay for an exhibition about pools in southern California.Pools are bottomless pits of wasted money and water as well as ""potential lawsuits, floating rodent carcasses and summer algae blooms"", said Hebdige. ""The swimming pool and the gas-guzzling automobile are the twin booster icons of LA in its mid-century glory days as the city of a future that's no longer considered viable.""If this is the case, Hollywood's screenwriters will doubtless take note. On screen, private pools usually evoke the Californian dream of having your own backyard oasis, a refuge from troubles – think Dustin Hoffman floating on a lilo in The Graduate. But there is also a noir tradition: Joe Gillis, the fictional screenwriter played by William Holden, is found floating face down in the opening scene of Sunset Boulevard. Or think of the singed, mutilated teddy bear from Breaking Bad, expelled from a destroyed plane, bobbing in Walter White's pool. (The series was originally set in LA, then moved to Albuquerque.)Roman Polanski's masterpiece, Chinatown, in which Jack Nicholson's private detective uncovers murderous dealings in California's early water wars, set a dark tone which has returned, to some extent, amid a three-year drought.More than half of the state – 58% – is now classified as experiencing ""exceptional"" drought, the harshest on a five-level scale. The entire state has been in ""severe"" drought since May , which has had the effect of melting ski runs, drying lakes and rivers, marooning boats, draining reservoirs, and turning farms to dust. Cemeteries are cutting back on grass.The state legislature recently passed a $7.5bn water bond measure but there is no consensus over a proposal for two 35-mile tunnels that would siphon water from the Sacramento river to the San Joaquin valley.Some cities have turned off fountains and rationed water until – unless – rains come. California has given local agencies the authority to fine those who waste water up to $500 a day. Environmentalists are depicting green lawns – another symbol of the middle-class dream – as reckless.Against that backdrop, private swimming pools can appear indulgent, if not selfish. The average uncovered pool in LA loses about 20,000 gallons to evaporation per year.Those with leaks can lose an additional 700 gallons daily, according to Hebdige. His essay for the 2012 Backyard Oasis exhibition on southern Californian pools was entitled, ""HOLE … swimming … floating … sinking … drowning.""Christopher Hawthorne, the Los Angeles Times architecture critic, said private pools represented a bold 20th-century effort to cleave the metropolis from the natural world, specifically the Pacific.""Increasingly that brashness looks misplaced or antique; instead we seem at the mercy of forces beyond our control when it comes to water,"" he noted last month. ""The swimming pool – like the surface parking lot, the freeway, the lawn and the single-family house – is rapidly fading as a symbolic and cultural marker of Los Angeles.""As you descend into LA, arguably the second most striking thing about the city – after the endless, concrete vastness – is the number of turquoise pools. Big and small, rectangular and square, round and oval, thousands glint in the sun.There are an estimated 1.1m pools in California. Thanks to two young academics, Benedikt Gross and Joseph Lee, we have a precise number for the LA basin: 43,123. They used satellite images, public databases and crowdsourcing to produce the digital map. The resulting Big Atlas of LA Pools, which runs to 6,000 pages, concluded that the typical swimming pool in LA is oval and measures 16 feet, four inches by 33 feet, six inches (4.98 metres x 10.21 metres).Beverly Hills, with 2,481, had the highest number per capita. Long Beach, with 2,859, and Rancho Palos Verdes, at 2,592, were also privileged. Two neighbourhoods, Watts and Florence, which are predominantly poor, Latino and African-American, had no backyard pools at all.Drought notwithstanding, there is little sign that the artistic and environmental critique will signal a popular revolt.Barsuglia, whose desert installation runs until 30 September, thinks private pools will probably endure as symbols of glamour and status: ""Most people are aware of the fragility of the environment but only a few will change their way of living. That's one problem with the capitalistic democracy – nobody takes personal responsibility for society.""",2014-09-06T15:21:38Z,"They were the last word in glamour, but has the sun set on LA's swimming pools?",,93,"As the state tackles a three-year water crisis, artists and academics condemn 'backyard oases' as selfish and wasteful<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/sep/06/hollywood-swimming-pools-in-pictures"" title="""">Hollywood swimming pools – in picture</a>",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2014/9/6/1410009817411/Dustin-Hoffman-in-the-poo-006.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/06/drought-california-swimming-pools,5,neutral
"From his front door to the banks of the Cantareira reservoir, José Christiano da Silva used to stroll only a hundred metres when he first moved to the area in 2009. Today, amid the worst drought in São Paulo's history, he must now trek a kilometre across the dried-up bed before he reaches what's left of the most important water supply for South America's biggest city.""It's frightening to look at,"" says the retiree, standing on cracked mud. ""In the past, we'd already be under water here."" After the driest six months since records began 84 years ago, the volume of the Cantareira system has fallen to 10.7% of its capacity, raising alarms for the nearby urban population of 20 million people and the most important economic hub on the continent.The drought, affecting Brazil's southeast and central regions, has prompted rationing in 19 cities, undermined hydropower generation, pushed up greenhouse gas emissions and led to squabbles between states vying for dwindling water resources.Supplies are usually abundant. Brazil has 12% of the world's freshwater and less than 3% of the world population. Apart from the arid northeastern Cerrado, its cities are normally more likely to be plagued with floods than droughts. With big rivers like the Amazon and Paraná, the country generally meets 80% of energy needs with hydropower.But this year, the rain fronts that are normally carried south from the humid Amazon have largely failed to materialise and temperatures have been higher than usual, prompting the authorities to scrabble to tap new sources and reduce demand. ""It has been a terrible year. The last rainy season was drier than the dry season,"" Mauro Arce, São Paulo's water resources secretary, told the Guardian. ""This is a crisis and we are responding with technical measures and the support of consumers.""In São Paulo city, that has meant financial incentives to encourage residents and businesses to reduce consumption, the reduction of water pressure by 75% at night (which in effect means a cut for those – often the poor – living in high areas) and tapping alternative supplies. In neighbouring cities, like Gaurulhos, more draconian measures are in place with some neighbourhoods only able to get water one day in three.Tensions have emerged between cities, and between those who want water for energy and those who need it for drinking, food and sanitation.São Paulo has tussled with Rio de Janeiro over the use of the Rio Jaguari, a river that runs across state borders and is used by the latter for hydropower plants and to dilute sewage in the absence of adequate treatment plants. São Paulo, which is downstream, has tapped this river to partially recuperate the Paraiba reservoir system despite the protests of its neighbour and admonitions from the federal government.""We're defending the inhabitants of São Paulo,"" said Arce. ""Brazilian law is very clear. In situations like the one we face now, the priority is people and animals … People in Rio should have no concerns. They have a lot of water.""Local newspapers have referred to the dispute as a ""water war"", though it is more an argument about who will bear the costs of the drought. Water and electricity prices are expected to rise a month or two after the elections in October. Power utilities said last month that the loss of hydro-generating capacity had cost them 15.8bn reais (£4.3bn). Most of this was spent on more expensive oil and other carbon-based fuels that filled the gap in electricity supply. This in turn has pushed up Brazil's greenhouse gas emissions this year.The outlook is as unpredictable as the weather. Government officials say that at current levels of depletion, the Cantareira system would empty in less than 100 days. The top two of the five reservoirs have been drawn down and now ""dead water"" – which is normally left untouched as a minimum level – is being pumped out of the third. City planners say they have an emergency plan to use still more dead water if the situation does not improve by November.The first rains of spring this week have brought only partial relief. Despite a downpour on Tuesday night, the water levels of the Cantareira reservoir remained unchanged. In the current climate, even this was hailed as a victory.""For the first time since April, the level didn't go down,"" said Arce, who says he is now having to draw up a fresh set of plans for the city because statistical predictions have to be adjusted in the light of the new reality of this super-drought.Up next to the Cantareira too, the residents are also struggling to keep up with baselines and shorelines that keep moving further from the norm.After the top reservoir shrunk into the distance, José Christiano da Silva moved his boat to the next lake down, but even there the water is now retreating as a result of emergency pumping that started 15 days ago. It is already about 20 metres from where it was and he expects it to diminish further.""I've never seen anything like it,"" he said.",2014-09-05T14:19:16Z,Brazil drought crisis leads to rationing and tensions,,94,Water rationed in 19 cities in southeast and central regions after usually abundant supplies run dry,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/5/1409926021030/Cracked-ground-Jaguari-da-006.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/weather/2014/sep/05/brazil-drought-crisis-rationing,3,neutral
"The ice bucket challenge has certainly raised awareness. Whether that’s primarily of the disease for which it is raising funds – amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, AKA motor neurone disease – or the speed at which images of swimsuit-clad celebrities will go viral is a long-term question. More pertinent right now is whether or not the craze has reached, er, tipping point. As it lived by social media, so the ice bucket challenge could die by it. If there’s one counter-trend to pour room-temperature water on the craze, it’s #droughtshaming. The state of California is currently experiencing one of the worst droughts on record. Taps have dried up, lakes and reservoirs are emptying, water wastage is being fined. So gestures such as companies dousing their staff en masse in hundreds of gallons of icy water, come across more as wasteful PR exercises than charitable gestures – and are being called out as such on Twitter.     Ice bucket challange: one Instagram user had a sardonic way of expressing their reservations    There has been a similar reaction in China. Last week, protesters in drought-stricken Henan province raised empty red buckets over their heads, accompanied by the slogan “Henan, please say no to the ice bucket challenge”. More practical is India’s Rice Bucket Challenge, started by a Hyderabad journalist, whereby participants simply give a bucket of rice to someone who needs it. China’s ministry for civil affairs, while broadly supportive, has warned citizens against the practice’s “entertainment and commercial tendencies” – so don’t hold out for Xi Jinping in his swimming trunks. Likewise, the US state department has forbidden diplomats from participating for fear of favouring particular charities. There are also ethical objections: Pamela Anderson and Grimes are among those who refused to take the challenge due to the ALS Association’s animal testing. Catholic leaders in the US have also banned schools from donating to the association since it carries out embryonic stem cell research.     The Rice Bucket Challenge: simply give some food to someone who needs it    But the real dampener could be the risk of bodily harm. Yesterday, the craze claimed its first fatality – albeit tenuously. A teenager drowned at a quarry in Fife shortly after taking the challenge. This comes after Corey Griffin – who popularised the Ice Bucket Challenge – drowned on Friday in a tragic diving accident. Last week, four firefighters in Kentucky were seriously injured in an elaborate variation on the challenge, in which a firetruck ladder got too close to overhead power lines. And doctors around the world have warned of risks to elderly people, expectant mothers and people with heart conditions. One Chinese health broadcast even warned of potential damage to vertebrae by ice cubes. Could it be that the ice bucket challenge can actually damage your health?

"Hold the bruschetta: olive oil prices are expected to rise sharply after a prolonged drought in the world's biggest producing region in southern Spain, at the same time as a blight has hit the crop in Puglia, Italy's main olive-growing area.While there is still time for rain to save the day in Andalusia, as harvesting takes place from October to January depending on the olive variety and location, without better weather soon this year's crop is predicted to be 40% down on the bumper 1.77 million-tonne harvest of 2013-14.""Not even the most optimistic are predicting a million tonnes,"" said David Erice of Spain's Small Farmers Union. ""We're expecting something closer to 2012, when production was around 700,000 tonnes.""Spain produces 50% of the world's olive oil, with 73% of that coming from the province of Andalusia in the south and 16% from Catalonia in the north-east. In 2013 olive oil exports from Andalusia were worth €1.5bn (£1.1bn).The drought isn't the only problem. Bumper harvests leave the trees exhausted, said Erice, and they produce far fewer olives the following year.Anticipation of a poor harvest means that in the wholesale market, where it is priced per kg, virgin olive oil has already risen from €2.40 to €2.70 per kg over the past few weeks, according to Infaoliva, the Spanish olive oil federation. The drought in 2012 led to a 13% price rise.Prices are predicted to rise by as much as €0.50c a litre – although extra virgin olive oil retails in supermarkets at around €3.00 a litre in Spain and is a popular loss leader in supermarket wars, to the detriment of producers who in recent years have complained that supermarkets have pushed the price down to below the cost of production. Some analysts predict that supermarkets will absorb any price hike in order to maintain their competitive edge.Virgin olive oil futures for September are at their highest level since June 2013, and some suppliers say that speculators are contributing to the rise in futures prices by capitalising on the uncertainty caused by the drought. The bets they are making are driving prices higher.There are also claims that some producers are withholding stock in anticipation of selling at a higher price later in the year. However, for all but the biggest producers the olive oil business has become a no-win proposition. If the harvest is good, the price slumps; a poor harvest means selling much less for only slightly more.The oil is exported principally to France, Portugal and Italy. Italy often repackages Spanish oil as ""estate bottled"", giving consumers the impression that it is an Italian product. Italy is the second largest producer after Spain, accounting for 15% of world production, with Greece producing 13%.This year Spain has overtaken Italy as the market leader in olive oil in the US and Japan. Worldwide demand for ""liquid gold"" has risen by 60% over the past 20 years, driven by increased demand in China, the US, Canada and Australia.Olive oil has been left off the list of agricultural products embargoed by Russia in its ongoing spat with the European Union. ""If Russia had included it in the list of banned products it would have been a great setback,"" says Rafael Picó of Asoliva, the oil exporters' association.While it is drought that threatens the Spanish harvest, in the southern Italian olive-growing region of Puglia the trees have been afflicted by the bacteria Xylella fastidiosa.""There is no cure. The only solution is to burn the infected trees to stop the bacteria spreading quickly,"" Raffaele Piano, a local grower, said. ""Prices will rise by 30% to 40% but quality will not be affected,"" he said.While harvests in other major producing countries such as Greece and Turkey are expected to be at average levels this year, they will not be able to make up for the shortfall in Spanish production, and price rises seem inevitable.",2014-08-25T15:43:44Z,Olive oil prices set to rise sharply after Andalusia drought,,96,Anticipation of poor harvest has already pushed up wholesale price from €2.40 to €2.70 per kg over past few weeks,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/25/1408980294225/Olive-oil-prices-set-to-r-006.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/25/olive-oil-prices-rise-andalusia-spain-drought-poor-harvest,7,negative
"Whether there’s too much of it or not enough, whether it’s too expensive or too dirty, water problems affect billions of people. Governments and water utilities spend vast sums every year on repairing pipes and installing new infrastructure, but water woes continue.  The water industry is increasingly looking to harness the power of mobile phone technology in an attempt to provide smarter solutions to persistent problems. Service disruptions India counts more than 940m mobile phone subscribers; yet only around one in four of its 1.2 billion people have access to clean drinking water in their own homes. Millions of people queue at public water pumps every day, often for hours due to damaged pipes or faulty faucets.  Pioneered in Bangalore and the brainchild of Anu Sridharan, NextDrop is a messaging service that informs people of planned delays or unexpected alterations to their service. Citizens can also text in updates about faults, which NextDrop forwards to the relevant water utility. The service has already been rolled out to over 75,000 mobile users.  IBM is pioneering a similar system. The Creek Watch app crowdsources information from citizens about the height and flow speed of their local watercourses, plus the amount of rubbish in evidence. These public updates feed real-time into a central database, which water control boards then use to track pollution and improve their general water resource management. Initially launched in San Jose, California, the app is now used in over 25 countries. Safe drinking Around 760,00 children under five years old die of diarrhoea every year – usually caused by the consumption of contaminated water or food – making it the second leading cause of death for the very young.  mWater aims to tackle the spread of diarrhoea and other water-related diseases by engaging citizens in water quality testing. The early-stage pilot is based in Mwanza, Tanzania’s second largest city, where a baseline study revealed faecal contamination in 90% of shallow dug wells and springs.  The app uses the onboard cameras on mobile phones, plus a $5 testing kit, to automatically detect colonies of coliform and E coli bacteria. The findings are instantly analysed and shared with local communities through an online map of safe water sources. Community health workers can also feed into the system, providing extra notes on the condition and status of water sources as well as details on the price and reliability of water. Last October, mWater received a $100,000 investment from USAID’s venture capital arm to enable it to send automated text messages to water users about safer drinking sources nearby.   Drought measures As California struggles through its third consecutive year of severe drought, conscientious homeowners can now use their phones to cut their water use. Before, people would have to wait three months until the utility bill dropped through the letterbox to understand their water consumption. Now, a new app gives householders access to daily water usage information.  The Dropcountr app follows a recent plea from the state governor for Californians to reduce water consumption by one fifth. The app includes alerts that warn customers before they hit “peak water usage”, as well as information about leaks.  “This is the first mobile app to connect consumers with their water use, empowering them to save water and money”, says Robb Barnitt, chief executive of Dropcountr, adding that the app can be used on any water meter system and by any water utility around the world.  People can also use their phones to dob in the neighbours. The social media service VizSafe allows phone owners to send anonymous reports about water wastage.  Water warnings Flood damage in the world’s largest 136 coast cities could hit $1tn (£640bn) a year by 2050. In the UK, smartphone users can access up-to-date information about flood risks in their specific area.  FloodAlerts, which won the Guardian’s Innovation Nation award in 2012, takes data from the Environment Agency and displays pin-point accurate shapes on a BING map. The app was developed by Shrewsbury-based software developer Shoothill, which recently launched a Twitter-based service that flags up water levels of individual rivers around the UK. Both services are run in partnership with the Environment Agency, a strong supporter of citizen-based information sharing. Using the PlantTracker app, the Environmental Agency encourages community members to submit geo-located photos about non-native plant species in UK rivers. The problem, which costs the UK economy an estimated £2bn per year, can block drains, disable water pumps and disable trash screens that reduce the risk of flooding.

"The golden state’s historic drought is forcing once-squeamish Californians to take a new look at “toilet-to-tap” water re-use. Or as they prefer to call it in Fountain Valley, “showers to flowers”. The town in conservative Orange County is home to the largest water recycling plant in the world and an example during this epic drought of the life-altering changes California will have to make to avoid running out of water. The first would be to get over the idea that water is an infinite resource, or that it pours out of the tap straight from a pristine, underground spring. This is the third year of drought in the west. By July end, more than half of California fell into the worst category of “exceptional drought”.  The state has made it illegal to hose down a sidewalk or operate a fountain, punishable by a $500 (£297) fine.  But those measures are largely symbolic, and the state is going to have to do much more to guarantee California a long-term supply of water. “Our sources of supply are literally drying up,” said Michael Markus, general manager of the Orange County water district, on a tour of the water plant.  The state’s main sources of water, snow melt from the Sierra Nevada, imported water from the Colorado river, and groundwater, are all in decline. So why not re-use water? Orange County has been doing it for six years, using highly purified waste water to replenish groundwater reserves. “We consider waste water not a waste but a resource,” Markus said. “If we didn’t have this water we wouldn’t be able to pump as much out of the basin,” he went on. “The basin would go into a state of overdraft.” The water re-use plant currently produces 70m gallons a day, turning residential waste water – from dishwashers, showers, washing machines and toilets – into potable water.           California drought: recycling waste water to replenish ground reserves – video    In February 2015, that will rise to 100m gallons a day, as a $140m expansion comes on-line. That will be enough to supply 850,000 people, or about one-third of the 2.4 million residents of Orange County.  Markus said the cost was significantly lower than importing water from northern California, and about half the cost of desalinating sea water – and the supply was guaranteed. The water goes through three stages of purification – filtration through a series of tiny straws to remove bacteria, reverse osmosis to remove dissolved chemicals, and exposure to UV light with hydrogen peroxide. By the time it leaves the plant, it is distilled water. About half of the water is pumped into injection wells to serve as a barrier against sea water intrusion. The rest is pumped 13 miles to underground basins in Anaheim, where it filters through layers of sand and gravel, gradually becoming part of Orange County’s water supply.  But it could still take some time before Californians get over their aversion to the idea of water re-use, or the notion that they can’t afford to go on dumping waste water.  The state currently dumps some 1.3bn gallons of water a day into the ocean off the coast of southern California.  One of the first attempts to move to water recycling, in San Diego in the 1990s, collapsed because of what water managers call the yuck factor. Those attitudes are changing, because of the threats to existing supply. California’s department of water resources reported last April that groundwater reserves had dropped 50 feet below historical lows across much of the state.     A drought-affected area near Los Altos hills, California. US farmers could lose $1.7bn because of water shortages, a study has warned. Photograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images    California law still does not allow the direct re-use of the water leaving the Orange County plant – even though it is purified to a higher standard than groundwater supplies. But the state regulator was looking to draft new rules to allow direct re-use of water by 2016. “I think it is inevitable that Californians are going to have to get beyond this notion of just ‘toilet-to-tap’,” said David Feldman, who teaches water management at the University of California at Irvine. “I think this plant is very important to protecting the strategic reserves of water. If we did not have this groundwater basin we would have to import virtually all of our water.” He said he expected to see growing water re-use in California and across the west – although not necessarily for potable water. Other water agencies in California are now actively looking at how to make best use of treated waste water, storm water and agricultural run-off, according to a research project from Stanford University. Los Angeles and San Diego are actively pursuing their own water re-use facilities. Riverside on the Santa Ana river also operates a water recycling plant that produces water for irrigation. Some 78 water projects have been funded so far, all aimed at putting water back into underground aquifers, the Water in the West researchers found. Those projects were on the drawing board before the drought – but they could help California get through the next one.",2014-08-07T13:00:11Z,"Get used to toilet-to-tap water, Californians told","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-c6a0d1cc-4440-41ac-b14f-f2ab816893eb""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/4/1407146586255/4213df70-b80b-4dbd-9a8a-3d747ec42be6-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Senior Plant Operator waits as water is used to push a membrane out from a pressure vessel in the Reverse Osmosis facility, which is part of the Groundwater Replenishing System in Orange County Water District, in Fountain Valley, California.

"This time last year, Samuel Aboto had 600 goats; today, he has none. ""I am not exaggerating – everybody knew my goats,"" he says as he shelters from the sun under a thatch of reeds. Twenty-six months of drought has hit pastoralists in northern Kenya hard, and Aboto is facing the fourth poor rainy season in a row. The last good rain in Nayanae'angikalalio, central Turkana, was between March and May 2012.Two weeks ago, there was one small shower. Aboto points to an outcrop across a few miles of tawny sand and scrub. ""There,"" he says, jabbing with his finger. A line of camels cross the horizon, the only animals the land can currently support.Aboto, who has four scrawny sheep remaining, draws a comparison to three years ago, when drought triggered a famine in Somalia and almost 4 million Kenyans were at risk of starvation (pdf). ""It was almost the same as this,"" he says. ""That was a combination of lack of grass and disease; this time it's just drought.""The findings of a Kenyan nutrition survey, published this month by the health ministry in consultation with the UN and NGOs, have alarmed experts. In the most vulnerable arid and semi-arid regions, which span about 80% of the country, one in four children is acutely malnourished and requires medical attention.Overall malnutrition rates in Turkana, Baringo and Mandera counties, and in the west of Wajir, have deteriorated significantly, according to the World Food Programme (WFP). A malnutrition rate of more than 15% is classified as a critical emergency by the World Health Organisation; in many parts of Kenya it exceeds 20%. ""The survey found truly alarming levels of malnutrition,"" says Challiss McDonough, a WFP spokeswoman.In Turkana Central, the rate of moderate and severe acute malnutrition is 60% higher than a year ago, according to Kenya's health ministry. Last year, 17% of those surveyed – pregnant women, nursing mothers and under-fives– were acutely malnourished. That proportion has risen to 29%.Women listen to elders discussing drought in Nayanae'angikalalio, Turkana Central. Residents say the village has not had adequate rainfall since May 2012.

Rapidly increasing populations have piled pressure on resources, and people have become less mobile. During a dry spell, herders once moved freely across the borders of Ethiopia, South Sudan and Uganda in search of fresh pasture. These days, national and regional boundaries, and the proliferation of small arms along them, have made it risky to do so.Cattle raiding is out of control on some borders. ""Conflict in the south and east [of Turkana County] is not traditional cattle rustling. It has become commercialised. There are businesses; men and women waiting to load [the cattle] and take them to market,"" says the deputy county governor, Peter Lokoel. It must be understood, he says, that conflict is contributing to malnutrition rates across the county, especially either side of Turkana's southern border. ""Today you are rich; tomorrow you have nothing,"" he says, referring to the clashes between raiders in Turkana and Pokot.As herds dwindle, men in Turkana are increasingly relying on their wives, many of whom sell charcoal or handmade jewellery and baskets. They buy maize flour and oil with the few hundred shillings (only a few dollars) they earn. ""The quantities are very small: that's what's hurting the most. Food cost 50 cents or a shilling during the first president's era. These days, you pay hundreds and get nothing,"" says Rodha Lokirion, an elderly woman who lives in a village 10 miles north of Lodwar, the capital of Turkana County.In Lodwar, 2kg of maize costs about 180 shillings ($2.14); in outlying areas, it can cost more. Residents say the decrepit road that connects Lodwar to the rest of Kenya has contributed to high food costs.For a trader to travel 300km (186 miles) by bus to Kitale, the first town south of Turkana, it takes about six hours and costs 1,600 shillings – approximately what the average Kenyan earns in a week, according to the World Bank. ""It's very expensive. When the road is good, the journey would be two to three hours,"" says Michael Emekwi Peikan, 31, who scrapes a living by driving a rented motorbike taxi.On Lake Turkana, one of the region's few reliable sources of protein, fish catches are dwindling. ""A lot of people are now engaging in fishing. They lack proper gear, so are putting a lot of pressure on the shallow waters that they are able to access,"" says Billy Kapua, projects manager at Friends of Lake Turkana, a community-led environmental trust. The shallower waters are critical for breeding fish. ""If the government could scale up support for fishermen to make the deeper waters accessible, that would help.""An aquifer below Turkana, which raised hopes of drought relief when it was announced last year, will yield nothing in the short term, Kapua says. There are resources and enough capacity to bolster the relief effort until the end of September, according to WFP, but the country could be hit by a severe funding shortfall thereafter.Jessica Hatcher reported from Turkana with the assistance of a grant from the Pulitzer Centre for Crisis Reporting",2014-07-30T05:59:00Z,"Drought in northern Kenya: 'Today you are rich, tomorrow you have nothing'",,100,<p>Prolonged dry spells push pastoralists to the brink of starvation as food prices soar and cattle raids spiral out of control. <strong>Jessica Hatcher</strong> reports</p>,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2014/7/28/1406552365338/MDG--Drought-in-Turkana-K-001.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jul/30/kenya-drought-food-starvation,2,negative
