"Meeting strict new EU pollution standards has added £1,500 to the cost of every new vehicle, say carmakers who claim that because of European legislation to cut tailpipe pollution, Britain’s air quality is better now than it has been for centuries. “New European emission limits, which apply to all new cars sold from this week, have the potential to all but eliminate exhaust pollutants that impact air quality,” said Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The European motor industry has been stung by World Health Organisation statement that diesel fumes are a “major cancer risk” and by government health figures suggesting particulate air pollution is killing 29,000 people a year. But as a result of European legislation to to reduce car pollution, since 1993, the minute, partially-burned bits of soot emitted from Britain’s 35m tailpipes have been cut by 96% in diesel vehicles, and the toxic NO2 gas has been reduced by 84%. Carbon dioxide emissions, which contribute to climate change, have dropped 82% in diesel and 63% in petrol cars. “Diesel particulate filters that capture 99% of all [particulates] have been developed. Today, particulate matter from cars meeting Euro 5 standard is equivalent to just one grain of sand per kilometre driven,” said Hawes.   But deaths from pollution are still a major problem. Last month new figures from government advisory body the committee on the medical effects of air pollutants, stated that a further 5,879 people a year in London died from toxic NO2 pollution. The UK has been in breach of the EU’s nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollution limits since 2010 and will not meet them until 2030 on current trends. In a new report, the industry claimed that it had spent hundreds of millions of pounds in the the past five years developing new engines and exhaust clean-up systems to meet the new Euro 6 standards.  “This imposes the toughest vehicle emission limits yet. It will ensure the cleanest cars in history. This latest standard mandates a 56% cut in diesel NOx emissions,” said the SMMT.  “The technology is arriving to develop the truly clean car. Technology has taken an enormous leap in the last few years,” said Ken Smith, a senior engineer with Delphi Engines.  “We can expect to see more plug-in electrics, hydrogen fuel vehicles and hybrids. But diesel is the only realistic power train that delivers the performance to move large loads. They will remain dominant for the forseeable future,” he said. Some health experts and pollution campaigners have called for a complete ban on diesel engines in London, Paris and other cities. But Alan Jones, chief engineer for diesel emissions at Jaguar Landrover said complex new systems to trap toxic gases could now convert 95% of all diesel emissions.  “We have spent £500m on a new engine plant. We have achieved mass CO2 reduction. Diesel has provided big benefits for CO2 in Europe,” said Jones. But air campaigner Simon Birket, founder of Clean Air for London pressure group, said motor industry promises were unconvincing. “Anyone else manufacturing a product declared carcinogenic by the World Health Organisation would scrap it and invest in something else.  “There is no end to the bad news with diesel: real world emissions many times worse than emission standards would suggest; frightening running costs and hassle when diesel particle filters fill with ash or soot; and the imminent prospect of bans from entering the most polluted areas as the only way cities can comply with WHO guidelines for air quality and legal limits. The devil should stop complaining about being demonised and start praying.” Car makers have also been hit by new European laws forcing them to test their cars under real world conditions and not in laboratories. This is thought to have allowed them to make unrealistic claims about emissions. By 2017 all new cars will have to be more stringently tested, effectively ending an era when car makers could exaggerate the performance of their machines.  “There is still more to do. Real driving emissions (RDE) will represent an important air quality breakthrough, ensuring that modern cars are ultra low in emissions and also deliver in the real world,” said the report.

"Vancouver is normally one of the world’s cleanest cities but this July its air resembled that in Beijing due to smoke and ash from forest fires over 200 kilometres away. Further fires along the western side of the US and Canada have caused numerous health warnings especially at night when smoke settled on valley communities. During August hot weather across southern Europe also led to forest fires in Spain, Portugal and Greece.   Related: Pollutionwatch: The world's dirtiest cities    Most landscape fires are not truly natural since they occur in areas managed for agriculture or forestry. Although they are generally well away from large cities, the smoke from these fires can travel a long way. Fires in western Russia in 2002 and 2006 led to air pollution problems across Europe as far as the UK. Forest fires across Spain and Portugal added to the health impacts of the 2003 European heatwave and Singapore and Kuala Lumpur experience annual air pollution problems from fires in Indonesia – most notably in 2013. But these are the fires that feature in the news. Globally around 340,000 deaths per year are thought to be attributable to the additional pollution from landscape fires. This health burden is largest in sub-Saharan Africa and south-east Asia. Landscape fires have greatest impact during El Niño years and least during La Niña, mainly due to differences in weather patterns across south east Asia. Here peat swamps and rainforests rarely burn without human instigation and fires can easily run out of control during dry years. Ending deforestation by burning would have many benefits, not only for global climate and biodiversity but for human health too.",2015-08-30T20:30:15Z,World Pollutionwatch: Wildfires can kill – far from the flames,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""e636c1b69b402ef5bb5abf0cff223fdd4dcb295a""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/e636c1b69b402ef5bb5abf0cff223fdd4dcb295a/101_104_4887_2931/1000.jpg"" alt=""Wildfires in the state of Washington, in the north-west of the US, generated heavy smoke in August.

"To adapt or to mitigate? That is the question that faces governments and industries across the globe as the impacts of climate change and pollution become ever clearer. It turns out, we will need to do both. The longer we allow pollution to be freely emitted, the fewer and more expensive will be the choices remaining to us. Pollution adaptation can take many forms, but it generally means dealing with a pollutant after it has been emitted, or it can mean changing infrastructure to make it more resilient to heavy rains, floods, or more intense storms. One great example of adaptation is being developed in Hong Kong and elsewhere in Asia by a major engineering company (Arup Engineering) and the CSR arm of a Hong Kong property developer (Sino Green). Arup and Sino Green are dealing with the environmental problem of localized airborne pollution.  In many parts of the world, airborne pollution levels are very high and can be elevated for long periods of time. These high levels of pollution can pose health problems to people and animals, particularly people with other health problems or those who are young or the elderly. In some cases, the airborne pollution levels can be at high levels for 8,000 hours (90%+) in a single year. There are many sources of pollution; for Arup Engineering, whose East Asia headquarters is in Hong Kong, much of the pollution is from nearby heavy industries across the border in mainland China and from vehicle emissions. At other locations, high levels of airborne pollution may be caused by burning of wood or dung for fire, slash-and-burn agricultural practices (particularly for countries near Indonesia), or from other causes. But, regardless of the cause, companies such as Arup are trying to find ways to reduce human exposure even when the airborne pollution levels are high. Arup is embarking on an effort to provide filtered air zones for people who are street side, perhaps waiting for public transportation. Much like a bus stop, the proposed structure (called City Air Purification System) provides clean air flow to create a cocoon around bystanders, shown in the following photograph.     Dr. Jimmy Tong (right) and colleagues from Sino Group. From right to left, Mr. David Ng, Executive Assistant to Chairman, Mr. Daryl Ng, Executive Director, and Mr. Vincent Lo, General Manager, showcasing a patent-pending clean-air stand in Hong Kong.    The stand is able to accommodate approximately 20 people and washes them with filtered air, protecting them from particulates from passing traffic. The company has shown by both experiment and by numerical simulation (similar to a climate model), that the occupants breathe significantly healthier air. Not only is the Arup/Sino Green structure very energy efficient, but by providing clean air to residents, it is possible to counteract the deleterious health effects on the human body, particularly the respiratory and cardiovascular system.     An installed Arup/Sino Green clean-air stand in Hong Kong.    I asked the lead inventor, Dr. Jimmy Tong (with whom I worked in the past) about this project. He told me,   The system tested in Hong Kong had demonstrated an effectiveness of reducing particulate matter by 30–70%, and the system is moving to Beijing, China for further testing. Its success could also have huge effects when used in other cities around the world struggling with air pollution.   My view is that it is always better to deal with pollution by reducing the emissions. Adaptation is more expensive and less certain than mitigation. However, when the will to mitigate is not found, adaptation is the only plan B. Arup/Sino Green’s device is a bit of a window on the future to local solutions for a global problem.

"War, humanitarian catastrophe and economic crises in the Middle East have drastically altered air pollution levels in the region, according to a new study. In major cities across Syria, Iraq, Palestine and Egypt, the levels of nitrogen oxides have dropped by 20-50% since 2010, researchers told the Guardian. Satellite observations show that before 2010, levels had been on a steady and marked rise since the mid 1990s, when monitoring of pollution in the region from space began.  The report, published in the journal Science Advances, argues that the decline is “tragically” linked to political and social upheaval since the time of the Arab spring. It says the dramatic trend reversal is unique to the Middle East.  “We find that geopolitics and armed conflict in the Middle East have really drastically altered air pollution emissions,” said Prof Jos Lelieveld, director at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Germany and lead author on the report. “From 2005-10 the Middle East has been one of the regions with the fastest growing air pollution emissions. This also occurred in East Asia, but especially in the Middle East. This was related to economic growth in many countries. However it’s the only region in the world where this upward trend of pollution was interrupted around 2010 and then followed by very strong decline.”    Related: Islamic State destroys 5th-century monastery in central Syria    Nitrogen oxides are released into the atmosphere, produced by the burning of fossil fuels and to a lesser extent biofuels and agriculture. These have been shown to have a significant impact on air quality and climate change. The rise of Islamic State has led to a substantial decrease in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions in Baghdad and central Iraq since 2013, with a downward trend beginning two years earlier, the report says. A similar trend reversal is identified in Egypt around the time of the government’s overthrow in 2011. But it attributes drops in other parts of the region, such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, to the introduction of air quality controls.  In Syria, NO2 over Damascus and Aleppo has decreased by 40-50% since 2011, coinciding with the uprising of that year which triggered a bloody civil war that is ongoing. In sharp contrast, the report found a 20-30% increase in NO2 levels over Lebanon in 2014, which it links to the 1.5 million Syrian refugees that have moved into the country, where they make up at least one-fifth of the population. The analysis stretched as far as Greece, where NO2 levels have been in gradual decline for two decades, but the report shows the trend has accelerated as the economy has declined, citing a drop of 40% over Athens since 2008. The researchers focused their analysis on data collected by high resolution satellites on cities between 2005 and 2014. They then compared this data to development statistics gathered by the World Bank.  Lelieveld added that the observations have unexpectedly contradicted existing predictions, and that there should be further investment in the use of satellites to monitor the impacts of environmental measures, migration and economic crises. In the Middle East, there are no air quality networks on the ground. “These findings could not have been predicted and for this reason disagree with emissions scenarios used in the projections of air pollution and climate change in the future. Often these emissions are linked to energy use and CO2 but we find these are simply not good predictors for trends, at least not in the Middle East,” he said. Air pollution is becoming an increasingly political problem in fast developing countries such as India and China, where the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, recently vowed to “fight it with all our might”. Physicists believe that air pollutants are killing 4,000 people a day in the country, as a result of heart, lung and stroke problems. The report says: “Unfortunately, the Middle East is not the only region in the world affected by economic recession and upheaval owing to war, although geopolitical changes appear to be more drastic than elsewhere. It is tragic that some of the observed recent negative NO2 trends are associated with humanitarian catastrophes.”",2015-08-21T18:54:28Z,Middle East conflict 'drastically altered' air pollution levels in region – study,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""14746299b79679527bd8f22a4f6815e79cc058e8""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/14746299b79679527bd8f22a4f6815e79cc058e8/0_207_3110_1867/1000.jpg"" alt=""Smoggy skyline of Beirut in 2014"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Smoggy skyline of Beirut in 2014.

"It’s interesting to note how readily modern conservatism degenerates into a defence of corporate malfeasance. By this I don’t mean a defence of corporations in general, which you might expect from a political movement aligned with the interests of wealth and power, but of the worst corporations in particular. That is not a pro-corporate position, as favouring bad practice undermines the competitive position of more responsible companies. It’s a decision to side with the worst capitalists against the better capitalists. Because these kinds of policies appear in no one’s manifesto, and no one would seek to defend them in public, they are a classic indicator of political corruption. By this I mean operating on behalf of unrevealed and particular interests, rather than on behalf of either the constituencies that elected you or of the nation as a whole. Whenever you see the worst corporate practices championed, you suspect that influence is being peddled, that corporate party funding is being deployed, or that special favours are being granted through old boys’ networks and other forums of elite transaction. Often, on both sides of the Atlantic, the worst corporations win. The reason is straightforward: they are the ones spending money on politics. You don’t need to splash out on policies that align with the interests of the public; you do need to spend heavily on policies that damage the public interest; otherwise they will not pass. If a company is spending lavishly on lobbying and campaign finance, it is likely to be because it wants something that no one in their right mind would welcome. The more expensive politics becomes, the better the most irresponsible companies do. The latest example is the covert lobbying by the British government to try to weaken European air pollution rules on behalf of the coal industry. Before going any further, I should point out that the coal industry today bears little resemblance to the coal industry of the past. There is just one deep mine left in Britain, which will shut by the end of the year; all the others are opencast pits: landscape destruction on a nightmarish scale, which is opposed by most of the communities it affects. Despite this massive environmental impact, opencasting provides a tiny number of jobs: the disproportion between impact and employment is comparable only to supertrawlers and upland sheep farming. When this government intervenes on behalf of the coal industry, it does so on behalf of those who own and run it, rather than for the tiny remaining fragment of the workforce against which the Conservative party has battled for years. That the lobbying was done secretly, and sought to undermine rules that had already been diluted through corporate pressure, adds to the impression that this was an intervention against the people of Britain, rather than on their behalf.     Dust particles and pollution from cars hangs over London, seen from Greenwich. Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA    The lobbying took place in the wake of a long series of new scientific findings about the impacts of air pollution on human health. If the government succeeds in undermining the common pollution rules, it is likely to be responsible for deaths that might otherwise have been prevented. Studies suggest these deaths will be concentrated in the country’s poorer communities. The latest findings suggest a link between air pollution and the earlier onset of dementia. They appear in just one of many recent papers showing a strong association between high levels of pollution and cognitive decline. Others, for example, show a faster loss of brain volume among older people, reduced verbal IQ among young children and poorer performance by schoolchildren in attention and memory tests. These studies augment a vast literature on other health impacts, such as lower birth weight, reduced lung development among children in polluted areas, asthma, heart attacks, strokes, lung and bladder cancers and higher susceptibility to both allergies and infectious diseases. Did you vote for that? I thought not. As a government committee takes account for the first time of the impacts of nitrogen dioxide, the projected death toll in the UK is likely to be raised from 29,000 people a year to around 60,000. In London, the number of premature deaths ascribed to air pollution is estimated at 9,400 a year, higher than the number of deaths attributed to smoking (8,400). The ethical difference is self-evident. Though the issue is complicated by marketing, addiction and passive smoking, there is usually a degree of choice involved in exposing yourself to tobacco smoke. We have no choice over exposure to air pollution. Why is this not a pungent political issue? Partly, I think, because of the widespread perception that the problem was solved many years ago. Take a look at these astonishing early photos of British industrial towns.   The smogs and fogs caused by pollution (smoke particles become the nucleii around which water vapour condenses) were regular features of urban life. Here’s how Charles Dickens describes one, in the opening pages of Bleak House:     Smog in 1952-3, Victoria Street, Manchester. Photograph: Tom Studdart for the Guardian    “Smoke lowering down from chimney-pots, making a soft black drizzle, with flakes of soot in it as big as full-grown snowflakes – gone into mourning, one might imagine, for the death of the sun ... Fog everywhere. Fog up the river, where it flows among green aits and meadows; fog down the river, where it rolls defiled among the tiers of shipping and the waterside pollutions of a great (and dirty) city ... Fog in the eyes and throats of ancient Greenwich pensioners, wheezing by the firesides of their wards ...” The Great London Smog of 1952, in which some 4,000 died, that helped, eventually, to produce our clean air acts, was one of many such incidents, albeit particularly severe. Its most deadly component was sulphur pollution from coal burning, which is what the Westminster government’s secret lobbying is now seeking to deregulate. According to Stephen Mosley at Leeds Beckett University, bronchitis used to be known as “the British disease”. If you survived the other afflictions of urban life, you had a high chance of being finished off by the filthy air. The problem in some cities was so severe that it appears to have been partly responsible for the high level of rickets: the smoke ensured that children had insufficient exposure to sunlight. (Rickets, caused by a lack of vitamin D, that is usually supplied by either sunlight or diet, is now returning to Britain, though on a smaller scale. One of the reasons is that some children scarcely venture outdoors.) The dark business suit (originally known as the Manchester suit) was widely adopted because it didn’t show the dirt caused by the constant rain of smuts and soot. If you stepped out wearing bright or pale colours, it wouldn’t be long before you looked as if you had climbed out of a coal mine. There have been major improvements over the past 60 years, though they are now being partially reversed by the rising number of diesel engines.  The World Health Organisation estimates that air pollution costs Europe roughly £1.4tn a year, equivalent to about one-tenth of the continent’s GDP. While I’m suspicious of both the principle and methodologies of translating human health and human life into money, there’s little doubt that major costs are involved, for public services, business and, above all, sufferers. Pollution damages both productivity and government finances: it is no part of the duty of a capitalist party to defend it.  Imagine what this policy would look like, had it appeared in the Conservative party’s manifesto: “We will lobby the European Union on behalf of polluting industries to reduce proposed smoke controls, endangering lives, threatening the cognitive health of both children and adults and damaging the country’s competitive position.” Because it is inconceivable that such a policy could be publicly announced, its pursuit can be understood as an assault on democracy. It reminds us that corruption, like pollution, is not the preserve of either the past or of other parts of the world; it is a potent force in Britain too. Like pollution, it seeps into our lives, invisible but pervasive.   www.monbiot.com ",2015-08-20T13:31:47Z,Tory lobbying against air pollution laws smells of political corruption,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""4c5dc30b0875348285702ff51705c6942bc0e5b1""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/4c5dc30b0875348285702ff51705c6942bc0e5b1/0_0_5363_3220/1000.jpg"" alt="" Ferrybridge, Eggborough and Drax Coal Fired Power Stations, Yorkshire, January 2009"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Air pollution is still a major health concern although not as visible as the smogs of the 1950s. </span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Paul White/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>",4,<strong>George Monbiot:</strong> The UK government’s bid to weaken EU laws to limit toxic pollution wouldn’t appear in any manifesto.

"Leaked documents show the UK is pushing for watered-down EU air pollution laws to be weakened further, arguing they would cause pit closures leading to substantial job losses and the need to import coal. The EU rules could help curb toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions, although campaigners criticised them following revelations that they were partly drafted by the same companies they were meant to regulate. But a confidential government submission to Brussels, seen by the Guardian, says that the UK would have to import coal from Russia, Colombia and South Africa to meet the new standards, because British coal has such a high sulphur content.   Related: Supreme court orders UK to draw up air pollution cleanup plan    This “would therefore lead to the loss of the principal market for UK coal and the closure of the UK’s coal mines,” the paper says. “The mine closures would also lead to substantial job losses – directly and indirectly within the supply chain – in areas of the UK with significant levels of unemployment and socio-economic deprivation.”  However, studies suggest that air pollution hits poor people in urban areas and ethnic minorities hardest, and its true early death toll could be even higher than the statistics suggest.  The new pollution rules would also be costly, risk energy security, and prevent indigenous coal being used in new power plants fitted with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, the UK warns. The only leading British politician to publicly make such a strong case for coal has been Jeremy Corbyn, the leftwing frontrunner in the Labour leadership contest, who foresees CCS potentially enabling a return to mining in South Wales, and benefiting working class communities. Last week a Welsh council rejected plans for a new opencast coal mine. Greenpeace argued that because two-thirds of fossil fuel reserves must be left underground to avoid climate breakdown, the government should offer retraining and financial support to miners, instead of a lifeline to their bosses. “To protect the profits of a few coal-burning energy firms the ‘greenest government ever’ is lobbying to water down air pollution rules that could save hundreds of lives and millions in NHS costs,” said Greenpeace’s head of energy, Daisy Sands. “Not content with locking consumers into higher bills by undermining the cheapest clean energy sources and home efficiency, ministers are now putting their health at risk by letting big polluters off the hook.” The new EU rules are expected to be agreed early next year, before coming into force in 2020.  In April, the supreme court gave the government until the end of the year to present a plan for cleaning up the country’s polluted air, which is responsible for 29,000 early deaths every year. The government is expected to announce its plan for bringing the UK into line with the EU’s existing air quality directive next month. The UK has been in breach of the EU’s nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollution limits since 2010 and will not meet them until 2030 on current trends, according to government figures, raising the spectre of fines of up to £300m a year. Alan Andrews, a lawyer for ClientEarth, which brought the supreme court case against the government, expressed dismay at the pro-coal stance in the leaked papers. “It suggests that they are not taking the supreme court decision seriously and are not making a genuine attempt to achieve the emissions reductions as soon as possible,” he told the Guardian. “We would seriously consider further legal action if that is the case, after we have analysed the new plan.”   ",2015-08-12T09:13:50Z,"UK lobbying for even weaker EU air pollution laws, leaked papers show","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""194f1fda2a96847fd8c361540ac1b3b248e886d4""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/194f1fda2a96847fd8c361540ac1b3b248e886d4/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg"" alt=""Coal is moved by heavy machinery at the Lodge House surface coal mine operated by U.K. Coal Plc., in Ilkeston, U.K., on Wednesday, Aug 4, 2010.

"Millionaire businessman Lord Paul Drayson, a major Labour party donor, former science minister and self-confessed “car nut”, is moving on to his next environmental challenge: a hi-tech bid to tackle the UK’s air pollution crisis. The peer, who made a reported £80m fortune from a needle-free injection system, has already funded the development of a record-breaking electric car through his company Drayson Technologies. In September, he will launch a personal air quality sensor that he hopes will not only help people avoid the most polluted routes but also add to pressure on local and central government to act on the problem.  London, Birmingham and Leeds are among the many UK cities that are not expected to meet EU safety limits on pollution until 2030. Tens of thousands of premature deaths each year are attributed to bad air quality by Public Health England, and a recent report commissioned by London mayor Boris Johnson blamed air pollution for killing nearly 9,500 people annually in the capital alone.   Related: Nearly 9,500 people die each year in London because of air pollution – study    “I’m an asthmatic, as are four of my children,” said Drayson. “My family lives in and around London, and I enjoying cycling and running. With access to the insight coming out of the development side of the business [Drayson Technologies], I became, like many others, acutely aware of the importance of air quality.” He said his fascination with the intersection of people and technology had led him to develop the CleanSpace service, which launches next month. It uses a £35 mobile-phone sized pollution sensor to talk via Bluetooth to an Android and IOS app that gives users reward points for biking or walking, rather than taking the car.  Those points – ‘CleanMiles’ – can then be exchanged for rewards with the companies that Drayson is partnering with. Halfords is the first signed up, but he also hopes to target coffee shops and other businesses. Oil and gas companies won’t be in the partner scheme, he says.     CleanSpace app Photograph: PR    “What I learned from politics is you have to persuade people what they’re moving to is better, rather than scaring them,” he said. The sensor uses technology from Imperial College London and was developed in conjunction with air quality experts at King’s College London. It measures carbon monoxide levels as a surrogate for vehicle pollutants, such as fine particulates known as PM2.5s and a toxic gas, nitrogen dioxide, generated by diesel vehicles. “The first step is to fully recognise the scale of the problem through better data and knowledge,” Drayson said. He likened the network element of the service to the Israeli startup Waze, which shares data from smartphone users to build up a map of traffic hotspots and achieved enough critical mass that it was bought by Google. Anonymised data from a user’s pollution sensor will be shared with other users so they can see which pollution blackspots to avoid on their journey. Whether CleanSpace can persuade enough users to buy into its model will be its key challenge. Public air-quality monitors already feed data to free rival pollution apps, though Drayson believes the personal and granular data his sensor offers will be enough of a lure. The UK government has been forced by a supreme court ruling in April to draw up a plan of action on air pollution by the end of the year. But Drayson said a bottom-up approach is needed too, as public awareness of the crisis is still relatively low. “I think the effect of air pollution is still relatively underappreciated and there is work to do in raising awareness of the impact it has.” “Yes, the government has a role to play, but this isn’t solely a government issue to tackle. The best way to achieve change, and for legislation and regulation to work, is for it to grow from and reflect the beliefs and behaviours of the general public as a whole.” There are currently 250 people on a closed beta of the CleanSpace network ahead of its launch, but Drayson has a target of signing up 500,000 members across the UK.",2015-08-11T06:00:08Z,Lord Drayson takes on UK air pollution crisis with new smart sensor,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""d8842a0a646b4663f50d57d7184d2b0a823191b0""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/d8842a0a646b4663f50d57d7184d2b0a823191b0/0_419_1552_931/1000.jpg"" alt=""In September, Drayson will launch a personal air quality sensor that he hopes will help people avoid the most polluted routes and add to pressure on local and central government to act on the problem."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">In September, Drayson will launch a personal air quality sensor that he hopes will help people avoid the most polluted routes and add to pressure on local and central government to act on the problem.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: REX Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>",6,CleanSpace service uses shared data from personal air quality sensors to create network of pollution hotspots,http://media.guim.co.uk/d8842a0a646b4663f50d57d7184d2b0a823191b0/0_419_1552_931/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/10/lord-drayson-takes-on-uk-air-pollution-crisis-with-new-smart-sensor,4,negative
"Thanks to people’s movements like Black Lives Matter and the Fight For 15, the call for racial and economic justice is getting louder and stronger. But while we are out on the streets fighting for equality, our kids are being poisoned by the air they breathe. Environmental injustices are taking black lives – that’s why our fight for equality has to include climate and environmental justice too. African-Americans are more likely to live near environmental hazards like power plants and be exposed to hazardous air pollution, including higher levels of nitrogen oxides, ozone, particulate matter and carbon dioxide than their white counterparts. The presence of these pollutants increases rates of asthma, respiratory illness and cardiovascular disease. It puts newborn babies at risk. It causes missed days of work and school. We can’t afford this. Black kids already have the highest rate of asthma in the nation, and our infant mortality rate is nearly double the national rate. Increased health problems hit people financially. African-Americans typically spend a higher share of their income on health care than their white counterparts (16.5% v 12.2%), and roughly one in five African-Americans don’t have health insurance.  President Obama’s Clean Power Plan is a desperately needed response to this problem. The Clean Power Plan would cut carbon pollution from power plants and put our country on a path towards cleaner energy solutions. It could stop up to 6,600 premature deaths and prevent up to 150,000 asthma attacks in children over the next 15 years – especially in African-American communities. The total climate and health benefits from the Clean Power Plan could add up to as much as $93bn. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), every dollar we spend on the Clean Power Plan will translate into $7 in health benefits for American families. That’s a good return on investment.  But some utility and fossil fuel companies are spending a lot of money to scare black people into believing this plan will hurt them. They’re afraid that tackling climate change and cleaning up pollution will cut into their enormous profits – and they want us to think it will hurt us, too. Nothing could be further from the truth. Pollution from power plants is America’s single largest contributor to climate change. But you won’t hear these industry executives talk about the toxic air their companies spew into communities of color or the disproportionate health costs we shoulder. They won’t spend time explaining that carbon emissions from power plants amplify the devastating effects of ozone and other pollutants, or that their pollution leads to a direct worsening of asthma symptoms. Nor will they admit that economic projections show that the Clean Power Plan will reduce utility costs for American families. The EPA estimates that electricity bills will go down by roughly 8%, saving customers almost $100 dollars annually – and that’s on top of the savings in health costs. According to the NRDC, the Clean Power Plan would create good, well-paying jobs in green technology and renewable energy. There are already more solar industry jobs than coal jobs in the United States. This energy revolution is an opportunity to increase African-American employment in a booming sector. Centuries of racial discrimination as well as bad trade deals and economic policies that favor the wealthiest have led to black Americans being almost three times more likely to live in poverty than white Americans. We can’t fight this trend by believing the lies that rich fossil fuel and utility executives tell us. Black lives matter more than corporate profits –now is a chance to make sure our laws reflect that.  This article was amended on 24 July 2015 to correct the name of the NRDC. It is the Natural Resources Defense Council, not the National Resources Defense Council.

"The impact air pollution has on Londoners is no one-day story; last week’s figures reveal an ongoing saga of suffering and misery for ordinary people (London air pollution leads to 9,500 early deaths a year, study says, 16 July). Every year the UK’s filthy air leads to up to 100,000 deaths, and many more people being diagnosed with respiratory illnesses. The supreme court has ruled against the government’s lack of action on air pollution, but no minister seems willing to drive change on the issue. We need a national solution now. Part of this could be for the government to enable all schools, hospitals and other critical institutions to become local clean-air zones that would protect those most vulnerable from the insidious effects of pollution. Another option would be to bring forward the imposition of the ultra low emission zone in London and get those vehicles that pollute the most off our streets.

"Nearly 9,500 people die early each year in London due to long-term exposure to air pollution, more than twice as many as previously thought, according to new research. The premature deaths are due to two key pollutants, fine particulates known as PM2.5s and the toxic gas nitrogen dioxide (NO2), according to a study carried out by researchers at King’s College London. The study – which was commissioned by the Greater London Authority and Transport for London – is believed to be the first by any city in the world to attempt to quantify how many people are being harmed by NO2. The gas is largely created by diesel cars, lorries and buses, and affects lung capacity and growth.   Related: All choked up: did Britain's dirty air make me dangerously ill?    London, Birmingham, and Leeds are among the UK cities that have been in breach of EU safety limits on NO2 for five years, prompting legal action that led to a supreme court ruling in April that the government must publish a clean-up plan by the end of the year. Previous research attributed 4,267 annual premature deaths to PM2.5s in 2008, based on 2006 levels of the particulates. Subsequent falls in those particulates and a change in methodology that excludes natural sources of the pollutant sees that figure fall to 3,537 for 2010 levels of PM2.5s in the new study. However that fall is more than cancelled out by the addition of an estimated 5,879 deaths from NO2 each year, bringing the total early deaths from both pollutants in 2010 to 9,416.  Matthew Pencharz, the deputy mayor for environment and energy, said that local authorities could only do so much and the government needed to step in. “It’s [the new research] an important message for government, where the supreme court judgment has already focused minds.” Although the report found that a larger proportion of deaths caused by PM2.5 were from particulates that originated outside the city than within it, it found that most of the deaths linked to NO2 were because of NO2 emissions from diesel vehicles and other sources within the capital.            London air pollution: which mode of transport has the highest exposure?     Last year, mayor Boris Johnson came in for criticism after a King’s researcher published figures showing Oxford Street had the worst NO2 levels in the world, largely because of its high concentration of diesel buses. The mayor later called for a diesel scrappage scheme to tackle pollution in the capital. But Pencharz said London was a pioneer when it came to tackling air pollution, with the mayor due to introduce an Ultra Low Emissions Zone (ULEZ) in 2020 that will see the most polluting HGVs and coaches charged £100 to enter. “No other city is doing half what we’re doing, when it comes to the ULEZ which is a world first, zero emissions taxis which is a world first, the regulations on construction equipment due in September,” he said. But campaigners said the evidence showed the need for more action. Alan Andrews, a lawyer at the NGO ClientEarth, which brough the case which lead to the supreme court ruling, said: “This new research piles more pressure on the government to come up with a clear and credible plan to cut pollution from diesel vehicles.” He added: “As shocking as they are, these deaths are really only the tip of the iceberg. For every person who dies early from air pollution, many more are made seriously ill, have to visit hospital or take time off work.” Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said: “Exposure to air pollution increases the risk of lung cancer, impairs child lung development and increases the risk of hospitalisation among people with a pre-existing lung condition. It is time we stop talking and take immediate action to prevent more people being needlessly killed by the air that they breathe.”   Related: Clean-air zones could protect the vulnerable from pollution | Letter    Jenny Bates, air pollution campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “People have no choice with the air they breathe. This means we have to redouble our efforts, stop tinkering around the edges, and take really bold immediate action with a mix of cleaner vehicles and cutting traffic levels, massive investment in safe cycling and walking, and London-wide road charging.” On Tuesday, the London Assembly’s environment committee published a report blaming diesel vehicles for the capital’s NO2 problem. Assembly member Stephen Knight, who is on the committee, said: “As petrol engines become cleaner with time it’s becoming clear that diesel emissions are a large part of the problem.” The study also looked at the impact of short-term exposure to PM2.5s and NO2 during high pollution episodes, such as the one that affected much of England in April, and found that 2,411 hospital admissions for respiratory problems a year could be blamed on the pollutants. The government’s scientific advisers on the issue, the committee on the medical effects of air pollutants, are expected to conclude later this year that across Britain up to 60,000 early deaths annually can be attributed to the two pollutants, because NO2 will be factored in for the first time. The figure would represent a doubling on the current 29,000 from PM2.5s, and would put air pollution much closer to smoking, which kills around 100,000 people a year.   Related: UK cities will exceed EU pollution limits until 2030, figures show    A King’s study due to be published in the autumn is expected to put the figure for deaths annually in the UK for the two pollutants at 80,000 compared to London’s 9,416, Pencharz told the Guardian. The mayor launched a consultation today on measures for boroughs to tackle pollution hotspots. All but two boroughs, Bromley and Sutton, failed to meet EU limits on NO2 in 2013, the latest year for which data is available.  TfL announced on Wednesday that two bus routes, the 507 and 521, will be run by 51 100% electric buses from next year, which do not have any tailpipe emissions.

"The record temperature this month also brought problems with summertime smog. Ground-level ozone reached between 7 and 9 on the UK’s 10-point air-quality index. Millions of people across the eastern half of England were exposed to pollution levels that were about twice World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines. This was the worst summertime smog across southern England since 2012. Ozone is synonymous with Los Angeles in the 1960s and 1970s, when concentrations could be assessed by measuring how fast the smog rotted rubber. At ground level, ozone forms from chemical reactions between natural, traffic and industrial pollution in strong sunlight, meaning that concentrations are usually greatest in the afternoon. Some people doing sport notice breathing problems at these times even if they are not asthmatic. In the evening, concentrations normally drop quickly as ozone reacts with surfaces and fresh city pollution. Avoiding strenuous exercise and endurance sports in the afternoon is a practical way for vulnerable people to reduce their exposure. Health guidelines for ozone are set assuming eight-hour exposure, based originally on studies of schoolchildren in summer camps. However, overnight on 30 June and 1 July, ozone-free air did not form close to the ground across southern England. (This might have been because of a combination of overnight breezes and changes to air pollution in our towns and cities.) Many people were exposed to ozone above WHO guidelines for up to 36 rather than eight hours.

"All but two of London’s boroughs are exceeding EU limits for a toxic gas linked to respiratory problems, ministers have admitted. Bromley and Sutton were the only two boroughs to meet the annual mean limit for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in 2013, the latest year for which data is available. NO2 is a pollutant created by diesel vehicles. The figures suggest that 24-hour EU limits for another pollutant, fine particulates known as PM10s, were met in every borough. But limits for a more harmful, smaller pollutant, PM2.5, were missed in seven boroughs: Hammersmith &amp; Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster, Ealing, Tower Hamlets, Camden and Brent. Sadiq Khan, the Labour MP who is campaigning for his party’s nomination as mayoral candidate, and who requested the numbers, said: “These figures paint a dismal picture of London’s long-term efforts to tackle air pollution and underline the need for a much bolder and more radical approach. “When it comes to reducing certain pollutants, it’s clear that any progress we have seen has been lacklustre at best, and in some cases simply non-existent.” The capital’s air pollution problem was brought to the fore last week when an independent review into airport expansion backed a third runway at Heathrow. The Davies Commission said it supported Heathrow only with the proviso that there was a “legal commitment on air quality” that new aviation capacity would not be added if it delayed compliance with EU limits.   Related: Heathrow expansion risks deepening London's air pollution crisis    The capital as a whole is not expected to comply with NO2 limits until 2030, even without expansion at Heathrow. As recently as 2011 every single borough failed to meet the limits, according to the figures released by Rory Stewart, minister for the natural environment.  Khan and several of the other London mayoral hopefuls, including Conservative Zac Goldsmith, oppose building a third runway at Heathrow on air and noise pollution grounds. The consultation for the Davies commission was extended to take in further evidence on air pollution after the government was ordered in April by the Supreme Court to submit a plan for tackling NO2 by the end of the year  Simon Birkett, founder of the Clean Air in London campaign, said: “With most of the breaches of NO2 laws in London due to diesel vehicles on Transport for London roads, it is clear the mayor has failed to help boroughs comply with these limits. “The situation is starkest around Heathrow... where a third runway would result in staggering increases in NO2 concentrations beside nearby roads.” A spokeswoman for Heathrow airport said: “We have always said that Heathrow expansion should only go ahead within EU air quality limits and the Airports [Davies] Commission has confirmed that our proposal meets this test.” The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, plans to introduce an “ultra low emission zone” (ULEZ) in 2020 to tackle the capital’s pollution problem, charging the owners of the most polluting vehicles up to £100 a day.  Last week, Transport for London announced that a fully electric double decker bus would go into service from October in a bid to cut pollutants. NO2 pollution hotspots such as Oxford Street are caused largely by a high concentration of diesel buses.   Related: Air pollution may cause more UK deaths than previously thought, say scientists    Later this year the government’s Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants is expected to factor NO2 into its calculations on the number of prematurely deaths caused annually by pollution.

"The US supreme court struck down new rules for America’s biggest air polluters on Monday, dealing a blow to the Obama administration’s efforts to set limits on the amount of mercury, arsenic and other toxins coal-fired power plants can spew into the air, lakes and rivers. The 5-4 decision was a major setback to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and could leave the agency more vulnerable to legal challenges to its other new carbon pollution rules, from industries and Republican-led states. The justices embraced the arguments from the industry and 21 Republican-led states that the EPA rules were prohibitively expensive and amounted to government overreach.  But the EPA pointed out that most plants had already either complied or made plans to comply with the ruling. “EPA is disappointed that the court did not uphold the rule, but this rule was issued more than three years ago, investments have been made and most plants are already well on their way to compliance,” the agency said in a statement obtained by Reuters. According to data compiled by SNL Energy, many generators in the US complied with the mercury and toxics compliance, despite the possibility that the court would strike down the rule.  The data showed that 200 plants, or roughly 20% of the US generating capacity, were given up to an extra year to comply with the standards, mostly in order to finish installing mercury controls.  Plants moved ahead with compliance plans due to the long lead time for environmental control projects, SNL said. The compliance deadline fell in April of this year.  The EPA “remains committed to ensuring that appropriate standards are in place to protect the public from the significant amount of toxic emissions from coal and oil-fired electric utilities and continue reducing the toxic pollution from these facilities,” the agency added.  Monday’s decision, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, ruled that the EPA did not reasonably consider the cost factor when drafting the toxic air-pollution regulations.  The Clean Air Act had directed the EPA to create rules to regulate power plants for mercury and other toxic pollutants that were “appropriate and necessary”.  The agency had previously said it did not need to consider costs during that stage of the regulatory process. The agency estimated that the cost of its regulation to power plants would be $9.6bn a year, but it said that its analysis “played no role” in whether regulations were deemed “necessary and appropriate”.  The EPA also estimated that the rule would produce up to $37bn-$90bn in benefits and would prevent up to 11,000 premature deaths and 130,000 asthma cases each year.  The EPA rule took effect for some plants in April and was due to go into full effect by next year. In the meantime, the rule remains in effect, lawyers working on the case told Reuters. The ruling only concerns the cost consideration, so the EPA may try to write the rule again with cost in mind. Scalia was joined in overturning the rule by the more conservative members of the bench, Chief Justice John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Anthony Kennedy . The dissent, written by Elena Kagan, was supported by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor. In his majority opinion, Scalia called the EPA’s counterarguments “unpersuasive”. In her dissent, Kagan said that the majority decision was “micromanaging” EPA’s rule-making, “based on little more than the word “appropriate”. Kagan also said that the court’s invalidation of the EPA’s rule because the agency had not considered cost at the initial stage of the regulatory process was a “blinkered” assessment, considering the “subsequent times and ways EPA considered costs in deciding what any regulation would look like like”.  The landmark decision is the latest chapter in a two-decade-long effort to force stricter emissions standards for coal-fired power plants. The regulation, adopted in 2012, would have affected about 600 coal-fired power plants across the country – many of which are concentrated in the midwest and the south. It was already going into effect across the country. But Republican governors and power companies challenged the EPA’s authority, saying the agency had mishandled estimates of the cost of the new rules. Monday’s decision was also a blow to years of local efforts to clean up dangerous air pollution. The supreme court has now sent the case back to the Washington DC circuit court of appeals, which will ask the EPA to reconsider its rule-making. Activists are now urging the EPA to act definitively and quickly to issue revised regulation. “The supreme court’s decision does not change the importance of EPA’s role in protecting our families and communities from toxic air pollution,” said Lisa Garcia of non-profit litigation group Earthjustice in a statement. “The court gave EPA the ability to finalize these critical public health protections once and for all. Now, EPA must act quickly. Thousands of lives are at stake.” Political reaction was divided along party lines, in a week that has seen supreme court victories for liberals - on gay marriage - and conservatives - on the death penalty.  “Today’s supreme court decision represents a cutting rebuke to the administration’s callous attitude,” said Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. “The ruling serves as a critical reminder to every governor contemplating the administration’s demands to impose more regressive – and likely illegal – regulations that promise even more middle-class pain.” Republican presidential candidate and Texas governor Rick Perry said Monday’s ruling “ends the false narrative that environmental protection can only be achieved through one-size-fits-all federal mandates and at the expense of economic growth.” By contrast, Democratic senator Patrick Leahy, a ranking member of the Senate judiciary committee, said that there was nothing more “necessary and appropriate” than “curbing poisonous pollutants that the EPA estimates are responsible for thousands of early deaths, and tens of thousands more illnesses each year” and condemned the court for “letting corporate profits trump the public’s health”. Democratic presidential candidate and former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley called the failure to limit poisonous toxins produced by power plants “a moral failure”. He said the court’s decision should reinforce “the need to transition to clean energy.” The EPA and campaigners have argued that the public health costs posed by the toxic air pollutants outweighed those to utility companies forced to fit new control equipment. Anna Aurilio, the Washington director of Environment America, said in a statement that the court’s decision “to let polluters off the hook is a huge setback for our kids’ health”. Earthjustice said that the rules now invalidated by the court’s decision would have saved “between 4,000 and 11,000 lives each year by substantially reducing pollution from the dirtiest plants”. In a statement, the group highlighted the fact that the court did not reject the key conclusions from the EPA, namely that power plants are “far and away the worst industrial polluters,” and controlling toxic emissions is “both technologically and economically feasible”. Joseph O Minnott, chief counsel of the Clean Air Council, said his organization was “disappointed” by the court’s decision not to uphold the EPA rules, “which would bring many of the country’s oldest and dirtiest power plants in line with modern standards, and allow citizens to breath cleaner safer air”. He added: “It is clear that the benefits to public health and the environment this rule would provide dwarf the costs of implementing it, no matter when in the determination those costs are considered.” Michigan v EPA was the third recent test for the Obama administration’s environmental policies at the supreme court. In April 2014, the court endorsed the EPA’s efforts to deal with air pollution blowing across state lines in an important victory for Obama. In June 2014, the court largely upheld Obama’s plans to cut carbon pollution from power plants.",2015-06-29T18:09:21Z,US supreme court strikes down Obama's EPA limits on mercury pollution,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""52e411debbc056cbfe72ed386dcf932fbf658735""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/8/1433772783896/cb61add3-b7b8-452b-8b35-63e315405965-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Coal smoke and steam vapor pour out of the Bruce Mansfield Power Plant Pennsylvania"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Coal smoke pours out of the Bruce Mansfield Power Plant in Shippingport, Pennsylvania.

"The UK government’s Airports Commission has recommended that a new runway at Heathrow should go ahead, but only with a legally binding commitment to control air and noise pollution. If the government decides to act on Howard Davies’ recommendation (and doing so would be a political minefield) Londoners will be forgiven for treating any air quality guarantees with a heavy pinch of salt.  Even before Wednesday morning’s announcement, London’s air quality was so bad that the government did not expect it to meet EU safety thresholds before 2030 - a full two decades later than the European deadline. In April, the supreme court ordered David Cameron’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) team to come up with a new plan by the end of the year to clean up London’s polluted skies as soon as possible. Their chances of doing so have just been blown wildly off course.   Related: Heathrow third runway recommended in report on airport capacity    “The scale of the challenge facing Defra was already enormous but this turns it into a Herculean task,” said Anna Heslop, a lawyer for the green law firm ClientEarth, which brought a case against Whitehall over its failure to tackle air quality. “It is a matter for the government to decide whether they now think it is impossible or not.” Heathrow is one of the UK’s pollution hotspots. In 2012, it breached safety thresholds for nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter air content at several different locations - and times – according to the airport’s own measurements.  Much of the pollution comes from the phalanxes of cars, taxis and buses which deposit and pick up travellers, rather than the planes themselves. To offset the traffic increase from any third runway, the government will, at the minimum, have to consider congestion zones, vehicle bans and changed bus routes, Heslop says. As things are, an air quality map drawn up by independent monitors at Kings College shows a big yellow blob of fetid air squatting to the west of London, where Heathrow sits.  And local air pollution is only part of the story. A third runway will mean more flights and so more CO2 emissions contributing to climate breakdown. The aviation industry is responsible for around five percent of annual global warming, when these emissions, along with water vapour, soot and sulphates, contrails, and enhanced sirrus cloud formations are added to its CO2 figures. That contribution is rising fast. By 2030, airline emissions are projected to double from 2005 levels. Between 1990 and 2006, they rose 87% in Europe alone.  The Airports commission concluded that a new runway could be compatible with the UK’s legally-binding climate targets. But this would depend on improbable improvements in aircraft efficiency; a misreading of the climate impacts of available biofuels; and a 6,600% increase in carbon taxes, according to Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, Doug Parr. “This is just a smokescreen to hide the obvious fact that a new runway will almost certainly derail our legally-binding climate targets,” he said. “In the year the world is coming together to tackle climate change, we should be talking about how to manage demand, not where to store up a new carbon bomb.”   Related: How would you be affected by a third runway at Heathrow?    Ironically, demand for air travel is actually falling in the business sector, with 61% of FTSE 500 companies in one poll saying they expected to travel more by train and 87% expecting to use more video conferencing in future. Most of the demand that the new runway is likely to cater for comes from a relatively small group of wealthy travellers – around 15% of the UK population who take 70% of all flights. To remain compatible with the Climate Change Act’s target of limiting aviation emissions to 37.5m tonnes of CO2 in 2050, the Aviation Environment Foundation estimates that 36% fewer passengers would have to fly in and out of airports in the southwest, 11% less in Scotland, 14% less in the northwest, and 55% less in the West Midlands. If the benefits of a third runway are easily available only to a few, its environmental, health and climate costs could well end up being paid by many.

"For three years Mohammad Yunus, his wife Babli, five children and a handful of relatives have made their home on a patch of concrete in the middle of an eight-lane motorway, near a stretch of road named after Mahatma Gandhi. As lorries, buses and motorcycles roar past on either side of the family’s cramped bit of south Delhi pavement, and a modern, concrete flyover carries several more lanes of traffic overhead, their evening routine unfolds. A young woman in a pink dress squats to kindle a fire from wooden sticks and plastic bottles, then breaks a lump of dough into pieces to bake into chapatti bread. A three-month-old baby and a toddler sleep on a dirty mat just a few feet from the curb. The incessant blaring of horns makes conversation difficult, but does not rouse the children. Delhi’s horrendous air pollution – the worst in the world, according to the World Health Organisation – is far from the only worry facing the Yunus family. But the poisonous fumes are doing them serious harm, and the children are particularly vulnerable to its health-wrecking effects.   Related: Child health fears at the most polluted spot in the world's most polluted city    Babli Yunus has a thick, phlegmy, hacking cough that she says never goes away. Her son Toufiq, who looks about nine (no one at this encampment knows their precise ages), has had a fever for several days. “I keep thinking that my health is so bad, and my children are also suffering, lying around here. But what can I do?” Babli asks as one daughter, aged about three, leans back in her lap, playing with a dirty yellow comb. “This child has a cough and cold. So does this one.” Babli doesn’t know whether the family’s latest round of illnesses was caused by the diesel and petrol exhaust that gives the air an acrid smell and a heavy feel, or by a soaking rain that left their clothes and blankets wet. “It all goes into our systems,” she says. “We end up eating a lot of dust.” “Dust, dirt, everything,” her husband echoes. “This is a main road. It never closes.” It is hard to imagine an existence more wretched than that of the Yunus family, huddled together on this dirty rectangle of concrete about 10 x 4 metres, surrounded by traffic on three sides and pressed on the fourth against a tall metal fence. Mohammad brings home what money he can, working on construction sites and selling vegetables in the market. His children, who do not attend school, earn a few coins collecting discarded plastic bottles from around a nearby bus stop. Mohammad says a total of 18–20 people live in the space. Their belongings hang from the fence’s spikes: a plastic bucket, bundles wrapped in patterned cloth, a few blankets, a shirt. Pedestrians stream past just inches away, dodging traffic and carrying goods on their heads or under their arms. A few months ago, a girl of around eight living on the same stretch of road was struck by a car and killed, nearby families say. Delhi’s foul air impacts all sections of its society. A 2010 study of more than 11,000 schoolchildren found 43% had poorly developing lungs, compared with 25% of a rural control group. The Delhi pupils were three times more likely to have severe impairment, and such deficits are believed to last for life.    I keep thinking that my health is so bad, and my children are also suffering, lying around here. But what can I do?  Babli Yunus     But the city’s destitute – poorly nourished, often suffering from chronic illnesses, and unable to afford medical care – are the most severely affected. “These people don’t get any respite from the pollution, even at night, so yes I think it does [cause more death and illness among the poor]”, says Dr Neeraj Jain, a respiratory consultant at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. “It’s just their economic status that makes them more vulnerable.” A growing body of research also shows that those living within a few hundred metres of major thoroughfares suffer greater health problems. Everywhere in Delhi, the air is thick with toxins, and levels of the tiniest pollution particles – linked to ailments from heart attacks and stroke to cancer, respiratory infections and even dementia – reach 17 times the recommended limits in some parts of the city. Even in the springtime, when the air is far better than in the filthy, choking winters, the haze is visible night and day, shimmering in the headlights of cars and blurring buildings and bridges behind a gauzy grey curtain. Mohammad and his relatives came to Delhi from their village near Lucknow because the high cost of land made it impossible for them to earn a living by farming. The family originally camped a few kilometres away but police forced them out so they settled beneath the flyover, unable to find anywhere better to live. “It was God’s will that we came here,” says Yunus, a slim man in a worn grey shirt and trousers, his face freshly shaven but for a neat moustache. “Where should we go? You tell us.”     Autorickshaw driver Nand Lal Kumar has difficulty breathing. Photograph: Neha Tara Mehta    The autorickshaw driver In Delhi, millions live much of their lives on the street. It is not just the homeless: vendors of everything from car parts and furniture to drinks and snacks spend their workdays beside busy roads. Rickshaw drivers wait at busy corners for fares, then pedal through heavy traffic, inhaling pollution deeply. Sitting for hours in New Delhi’s gridlocked traffic, perched behind the handlebars of his open-air autorickshaw, Nand Lal Kumar coughs and coughs, struggling for air. His head pounds, “my chest gets heavy, stomach gets tight” and “I feel suffocated, anxious.” “I have difficulty breathing at the end of the day, my face is black with soot,” says Kumar, waiting for his next fare on a noisy corner in south Delhi, beside a road jammed with honking cars, trucks and buses. “But there’s absolutely no other alternative. There are no other jobs.” Kumar, 38, left his village more than 20 years ago to seek opportunity in the capital, but he still struggles to scratch out a living. After fuel, maintenance and loan payments, he nets 300 or 400 rupees, about three or four pounds, each day. “I can’t even pay my rent on time. I haven’t been able to pay my children’s school fees for a year or two. I pay half the fee, they go for a while, then they have to stop,” he says. “Nobody thinks about autorickshaw drivers in this country. Passengers are only concerned that we might overcharge them. Nobody cares about us or our families.” The doorless, green-and-yellow three-wheelers that clog Delhi’s streets were converted to compressed natural gas years ago, so they create little pollution. Their drivers, though, inhale the health-wrecking air on the roads all day. Scientists who measured levels of tiny, dangerous airborne particles in autorickshaws’ backseats said they were the among the worst ever found in a regular form of transport, up to eight times higher than Delhi’s already disastrous baseline pollution. Kumar, in battered sandals and a worn, blue-grey uniform, knows he suffers the effects. He sees a respiratory expert every few months, to little avail. “’Take medicines and you’ll be fine,’ that’s what the doctor says. It gets OK and then it gets bad again,” he says. “My cough doesn’t stop for a month at a time. “I do worry about my future health, but there’s nothing I can do,” he says sadly. “My job is a hazard for me.” The young family As well as the 7.5 million vehicles on Delhi’s roads (with nearly 1,400 more added every day), smouldering garbage fires are everywhere in the city, and poor families burn wood and dung to cook and stay warm. Just beyond the city limits, thousands of primitive brick-making factories send plumes of black smoke into the air, while coal-burning power plants lack even the most basic filtration systems. Dirty diesel generators power mobile-phone towers and provide back-up electricity for malls, hospitals and apartment blocks. Smoke from the fires that farmers in neighbouring states set to get rid of crop stubble after harvest settles over the city. Construction projects such as the expansion of the Delhi Metro – a long-term hope for reducing pollution – only add to the clouds of dust. After Manjali Khosla and her family moved to Delhi from Dubai three years ago, she spent the first six months fighting pneumonia. She tried every brand of face mask she could find, to filter out the pollution she blames for her illness and keep others from catching it. Born in India and raised in Hong Kong and North America, Manjali wanted her children to experience life in their parents’ home country and spend time with extended family. She and her husband did not understand until they arrived just how big a role Delhi’s filthy air would play in their lives.    You feel like there’s like an ulcer inside you, something’s burning, and it takes a week for the feeling to go away  Manjali Khosla        Garbage fires are everywhere in Delhi. Photograph: Neha Tara Mehta    The children, a 10-year-old and twins aged eight, sometimes wear masks at school. Someone in the family is always coughing and Manjali’s father-in-law suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a severe lung problem. She has a PhD in chemistry so she understands the science. Air pollution is India’s fifth-biggest killer, causing 620,000 premature deaths a year, and it terrifies her. Manjali has bought filters for the family’s house and plants that are said to purify the air. She finds indoor activities to discourage the kids from playing outside on the foulest days, and plans holidays abroad as often as possible – but still frets about what their years in Delhi may do to her children’s health. “I’ve even dreamed polyps coming out of their lungs, something very drastic,” she says. Returning to Delhi after trips away, the kids come off the plane holding their noses. Symptoms are always bad during the first days back: “You feel like there’s like an ulcer or something inside you, something’s burning, and it takes about a week for the feeling to go away,” she says. “The sinuses hurt, your head hurts, your eyes water.” But while many of the foreign families Manjali knows are contemplating leaving, she is determined to stay in Delhi for a few more years yet.  “My kids say, ‘Why are we here, why don’t we just leave?’ But I say, ‘If we leave, it doesn’t solve the problem – your grandparents are still here, your cousins are still here. Let’s stay and try to fix it. And in the meantime, wear masks.’” The paediatrician Dr Sanjeev Bagai has one word to describe what it feels like to see the wheezing children who stream through his surgery door every day: “Helpless.”He can treat them with steroids and inhalers, and antibiotics for those with bronchitis – but he cannot clean the air that makes them sick. In his practice, asthma cases are up by 40-45% in the last five years, poor lung function is common, and lowered oxygen levels caused by breathing difficulties can lead to long-term problems with vision, growth and brain development, says the paediatrician. “This morning, I’ve seen five patients; three had wheezing.” All of them were under six. Bagai, a burly man with cufflinks and a carefully waxed handlebar moustache, explains that asthma, once seen only in children over three or four, is now common in babies and toddlers. He once diagnosed it in a newborn, less than three weeks old. “Rapid breathing, breathlessness, spasmodic cough,” he says. “ It can be life-threatening.” According to Bagai, asthma carries a stigma in India, and young patients often become depressed and withdrawn. “They feel scared to play, they miss a lot of school days,” he says. “Very often kids say, ‘I’m taking all the medicine, but why am I getting this again and again? Why me?’”  The lorry driver     Truck driver Surinder Singh is worried about a possible ban on old diesel vehicles. Photograph: Neha Tara Mehta    In the hottest part of a baking day, eight truckers are stretched out on a concrete platform in their company’s bare, windowless office, waiting for 10pm, the earliest they are allowed to drive their hulking diesel vehicles through Delhi. A dozen lorries are parked outside, their cabs decorated with scraps of sparkly tinsel. “It’s a tough life, but this is what I do,” says Surinder Singh, sitting on a blue wooden table, a Hindi newspaper in one hand. “If I had some other job, I could spend time with my children, relax, go to the market.” It is mid-afternoon and Singh, with a round face and boyish sweetness in his eyes, has not been home since last night; grey stubble covers his cheeks and chin. He plans to stop there for a nap, dinner and a bath before heading out with a load of iron pipes. “There is no rest in this job.” An estimated 80,000 trucks crowd Delhi’s roads every night, spewing a toxic stew of pollutants. So Singh and other drivers have become a focus of the city’s growing pollution concerns. Now, their livelihoods are in jeopardy. In April, judges barred all diesel vehicles more than 10 years old from entering the capital. Truck drivers threatened to strike and the court postponed its order, but the threat remains. “My truck will be as good as scrap [under the rule],” Singh says. He estimates the decision slashed two-thirds off the value of the lorry that became his in 2013, after nine years of repayments. “How will I feed my children? How will I educate them if I lose my business, my job?” He feels the effects of dirty air himself – shortness of breath, itchy eyes, a cough. But he doesn’t think truckers deserve all the blame. “Look at the garbage fire right here,” he adds, pointing toward a thick cloud of acrid smoke across the street. “And what about the 20 and 25-year-old cars that drive on the roads of Delhi?”  The wantaway Delhiite Pavika Bakshi has swallowed live fish and drunk the waters of a healing stream in search of something to stop her wheezing. Aside from medication, the only thing that helps, she says, is yoga.  It won’t be enough to keep her in New Delhi, though. Bakshi’s parents are searching for a husband for her, and she has told them to look beyond the city. “It could be outside India, it could be in India around the coastline,” she says, perched on a chair in a quiet room at the yoga school where she practices. “Anywhere I feel better. “It’s not a happy situation to be in, because this is my city and I absolutely love it – but I wish it was minus this huge baggage. I keep asking my mother all the time, ‘Why are we a part of this place? Why are we here? Can we not leave?’” Bakshi, 32, says she feels well whenever she goes abroad, so is certain it is Delhi’s air that makes her chest grow tight and her breathing raspy. “You come back glowing, because you are healthier,” she says. But soon after returning, “there is no energy and you are lifeless and you are dull”. Her friends talk all the time about leaving, says Bakshi, who has long, dark hair and a sparkling stud in her nose. “We’ve all been in good jobs, we are making good money here, but what am I supposed to do with that money?” she says. “It can’t buy me clean air.”   Related: 'The air is stinking, it’s dirty': the fight against pollution in Kraków    Dirty air, and the death and illness it causes, have become front-page news in India. Government ministers and the courts are taking heed, announcing a bevy of measures – from fines for burning garbage to coal-fired power plant upgrades. But many doubt the rules will be enforced. “At one level, I’m confident that something will happen now, because the public outrage over this rising pollution is at such a pitch that a government cannot ignore it altogether,” says Arindam Sen Gupta , executive editor of the Times of India. “But how effective this plan will be is a matter of speculation.  “I don’t think there’s a cohesive vision – we work in fits and starts. When the problem becomes acute, we wake up to it and then emergency measures are taken.

"Last year, a study by the World Health Organisation found that Delhi had the dirtiest atmosphere of 1,600 cities around the world for PM2.5 particles. PM stands for particulate matter – solid particles or liquid droplets in the air. When smaller than 2.5 micrometers (that’s 100 times thinner than a human hair), they are known as PM2.5. These are created by such things as vehicle emissions, forest fires and smelting and processing metals.  The WHO recorded an annual average concentration of PM2.5 of 153 micrograms per cubic metre in the Indian capital.  The particles are able to penetrate deep into the lungs, and have been linked with an increase in chronic bronchitis, lung cancer and heart disease. The WHO considers the measurement of PM2.5 to be the best indicator of the level of health risks from air pollution.   Cities   According to the WHO data, the equivalent measure for London was 16 micrograms per cubic metre. However, joggers in London were last week told to avoid certain streets in the City due to high levels of air pollution.    Related: Indian children fall victim to Delhi's appalling pollution    But how bad is London? It depends where you compare it with. As the London Air Quality Network (LAQN) points out, due to its dense road network, high buildings, the size of the city and the volume of traffic, the capital fares badly compared with other cities in the UK.  Globally, however, London doesn’t do too badly. The LAQN concludes that after ranking World Bank data on air pollution in 3,226 cities with a population greater than 100,000, from high to low, London would be placed 2,516th.  The World Bank data also shows that air pollution is a bigger problem in developing countries.  There isn’t universal agreement on the pollution measurements. In fact, a member of India’s state-run System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research disputed the WHO figure for Beijing (56) at the time of the report’s publication. The WHO states that the most health-damaging particles are those with a diameter of 10 microns or less. This is due to the ability of the smaller particles to travel deeper into the lungs and pass into the blood stream.  Sources of PM 10 particles, or coarse particles, can be dirt and dust stirred up on roads by vehicles, or crushing and grinding operations. Mould, dust and pollen are examples of the particles which are between 2.5 an 10 micrometers in size, or about 25 to 100 times thinner than a human hair. Looking at the data for the annual average mean concentration of PM10 per cubic metre, Peshawar in Pakistan records the highest level. By this measure, Delhi is seventh highest on the list, behind other cities in India such as Gwalior and Raipur.   Country   Pakistan records the highest level over all of the 91 countries in the WHO air pollution database.  Recent estimates by the WHO placed the number of global deaths as a result of air pollution exposure (inside and outside the home) at 7 million in 2012.         According to the WHO, air pollution is now the world’s largest single environmental health risk.

"Three months ago, a surgeon at Liverpool Heart and Chest hospital took a saw, ripped through my sternum, levered open my ribcage, cut into the aorta of my still-beating heart and stitched in a vein from my leg. The long, brutal operation was a great success. But it knocked me out and left me unable to walk more than a few paces. As I recovered, I got to asking how had I got into this mess. I had always, I thought, kept pretty fit: I could happily walk all day in the hills, chop wood, play cricket and dig deep. I ate good food and loved exercise. So what else was there in my lifestyle that could have led to heart disease, Britain’s biggest killer? The doctors routinely blamed my smoking for 20 years, though I had started late and given up more than 11 years ago. But there was also the fact that I had grown up, and then worked, in some of the most heavily polluted places in the world: Birmingham, Sunderland, Dhaka, Accra, Lagos, Jakarta, London and Paris, to name a few. Was it those lungfuls of foul air in Bangladesh, or in Birmingham in the 1960s? Was it covering smogs and pollution in Russia for the Guardian? Could heart disease be the price of living in a modern city? Appreciation that city life is not just fast, but possibly dangerous, dawned slowly. When young, I could easily ignore the stinging eyes, acrid smell and need to spit after walking or cycling for a few minutes in a busy street. The suspicion that air could be a killer only started seriously with the wheezing I experienced long after I had quit smoking, when climbing a mountain became harder and the pauses for breath longer. I was shocked, in 2009, to be diagnosed with angina. But I was knocked out when last year I was told I needed a heart bypass. That happened only to people who were really ill, didn’t it?    I worked in some of the most polluted places in the world. Could heart disease be the price of living in a modern city?    “See it as a precaution. Statistically, you’ll live longer,” said my cardiologist. “If you don’t have it, you can expect a heart attack any time.” In the worrisome months following the diagnosis and before the operation, I delved into the scientific literature. The links between air pollution and heart disease, only a generation ago uncertain, were now robust. Paper after paper showed how long-term exposure to air pollutants was now linked to high blood pressure, strokes and heart conditions like mine. But how much of my heart disease was self-inflicted and how much imposed? As people increasingly gave up cigarettes and heavy industry migrated to China and the east, were Europeans becoming more exposed to other sorts of air pollution? Were the streets of London or Paris more dangerous now than in the past? I asked Fintan Hurley, science director at the Institute of Occupational Medicine (IOM) in Edinburgh. “I think of air pollution as one risk factor among many that increases the risk of earlier death,” he says. “Everybody is exposed. And largely it’s involuntary. Active cigarette smoking has at least the appearance of being a choice. A person may have some choices about how much air pollution they experience, but basically, it’s a risk factor imposed by society as a whole to which an individual contributes.”     A cyclist in London. In 1950, there were 4m cars on Britain’s roads; today, there are 28m. Photograph: Sang Tan/AP    He and Frank Kelly, who chairs the Committee on the Medical Aspects of Air Pollution, shocked the British government in 2010, when they stated that air pollution caused the premature deaths of 29,000 people a year in Britain – second only to smoking. Some researchers believe the mortality rate could actually be up to twice as high. So how have we reached this point? And why isn’t more being done? I started to look for answers in the place where modern air pollution could be said to have really got going: Coatbridge, 10 miles east of Glasgow. In Victorian times, this was Britain’s – maybe the world’s – most polluted town. Its 300 coalmines, 50 steel blast furnaces and innumerable factory chimneys pumped out hundreds of tonnes of soot, sulphur and noxious vapours every day. Today, the heavy industry has long gone and the once-dark Coatbridge air is cleaner than in most other British towns. Indeed, at 10.40 on a bright April morning, on the site of an old iron smelter in what is now the Summerlee museum of Scottish industrial life, a monitor borrowed from the IOM barely registered Britain’s two main air pollutants - the toxic gas called nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and the tiny particles of soot, or dust, called PM2.5s. Kerry Garvie, whose father was a miner in nearby Bedlay colliery, recalls how her mother struggled to keep anything clean, how her Uncle John had breathing problems and how her clothes always got black. For Garvie’s relatives, air pollution was a fact of life, and life was often short. “It is what they lived with and what they knew,” she says.    'Cigarette smoking has at least the appearance of choice. Air pollution is a risk factor imposed by society as a whole'  Fintan Hurley, Institute of Occupational Medicine     But do we know better now? Ten miles west of Coatbridge, Glasgow city centre was that day, as usual, snarled with traffic. Wherever I walked with Emelia Hanna, Friends of the Earth Scotland’s air pollution campaigner, the monitor read five or more times higher than in Coatbridge. The fine particles peaked in the taxi rank outside Queen Street railway station; the nitrogen dioxide count soared way over the European legal limit near main roads. Glasgow has tighter pollution laws than England and Wales, but is far and away Scotland’s most toxic town. “No wonder,” Hanna says. “It is ringed by motorways, served by hundreds of old diesel buses, its lines of cabs keep their engines running all day.” According to government figures, air pollution is responsible for more than 300 deaths a year in Glasgow. “Most people here know someone affected by asthma, heart disease or lung problems,” Hanna says. “It affects children and people on lower incomes worst.” *** Neighbouring Coatbridge and Glasgow show how air pollution in Britain has changed in just a few generations. The coal and wood smoke that belched from Britain’s factories and hearths may have vastly reduced, but it has been replaced by a toxic soup of nitrogen oxide gases and minute particles of unburned carbon and chemicals, produced by vehicles and fossil fuel-burning central-heating systems. Instead of pollution being concentrated in old industrial centres such as Sunderland, Widnes or Newport, the fumes are now worst in congested cities such as London, Birmingham, Leeds and Sheffield. The difference between now and 100 years ago, says Kelly, who is director of the environmental research group at King’s College, London, is that today’s air pollutants are largely invisible and odourless, and are obvious only when dust is occasionally swept up from the Sahara or when traffic and industrial fumes get trapped on sunny days and a dull orange-grey smog develops. “These acute events result in thousands of extra hospital admissions and breathing complaints, but they are relatively rare,” he says. “They come on top of the chronic air pollution that all British cities experience every day from heavy traffic. Some pollutants may indeed have disappeared since the infamous smogs of the 1950s, but people have an increasing level of other complaints, such as asthma attacks, cardiovascular and breathing problems.” Kelly’s office, housed on the upper floors of a drab 1960s building in south London, is the world’s largest centre of public research into the medical effects of air pollution. He and other scientists working here advise not just the UK government but the World Health Organisation and the most polluted countries in the world, such as China and India. Kelly and his colleagues now see air pollution spreading as populations and cities burgeon and, above all, as the car becomes ubiquitous. In 1950, there were around 4m cars in Britain and 35m in the world. Now, we have 28m and there are more than 750m worldwide, along with 200m vans and lorries. Could I really pin my own heart disease on the air I have breathed, as well as the smoke I have voluntarily inhaled? Certainly, says Ian Mudway, Kelly’s colleague and a lecturer in respiratory toxicology, whose research shows that children’s health is greatly affected by air pollution from a very early age. I first met Mudway at a residents’ meeting in the London borough of Tower Hamlets. He had been researching the lung capacity of children living near busy east London streets, and was telling his audience how the health of their communities would inevitably deteriorate if a new Thames road bridge or major tunnel was allowed to bring thousands of extra cars a day into the East End. “We have high-density housing here, slap-bang next to major roads,” he told the audience. “People still don’t see air pollution as a big issue. They understand that you die from alcohol or obesity, but air pollution doesn’t have that risk factor in people’s imagination. Yet it’s a killer.” The more researchers like Mudway have looked at people’s long-term exposure to air pollution, the worse the picture gets. The cautious International Agency for Research on Cancer suspected that PM2.5s were carcinogenic to humans back in 1988, but only in 2013 could it definitely say they were a cause of lung cancer. The most recent World Health Organisation data suggests there were 233,000 deaths from lung cancer caused by air pollution around the world in 2011. Meanwhile, a study from the University of Washington in the US cites 3.4m deaths from outdoor air pollution in 2010 – 400,000 more than in 1990.    For everyone who dies, there are many more hospitalised or who have impaired health  Ian Mudway, lecturer in respiratory toxicology     Adding the effects of indoor pollution, mostly from cooking fires in the developing world, brings the global death toll to 7m a year, according to the World Health Organisation. In short, air pollution is now officially the world’s biggest environmental cause of premature death – second only to smoking and the equivalent of alcohol and obesity combined in the UK and, in 2013, causing more deaths worldwide than Aids and malaria. But where are the victims? No postmortem states air pollution to be a primary cause of death, and few people take a day off work because of it. Yet we now know that PM2.5s, which get deep into the lungs and bloodstream from exhaust fumes, can greatly worsen respiratory and heart conditions such as my own, trigger heart attacks and lead to brain damage, cancers, even nerve, liver and kidney diseases. “For everyone who dies, there are many more hospitalised or who have impaired health,” Mudway says. “Prolonged exposure to elevated [particulate pollution levels] is associated with significant life-shortening and poor respiratory health. Acute episodes can precipitate death.” *** Mal Chadwick is a young, fit cyclist, but when he arrived in London from York five years ago, he found himself wheezing. He cycles around 40 miles a week in the city, and his doctor has diagnosed asthma, almost certainly aggravated by air pollution. “The air quality of the two cities is noticeably different,” Chadwick says. “When you bike in London, you get it full in the face.” He uses an inhaler three or four times a week, but the pollution is worse in autumn and spring, when the temperatures can go quickly from cold to warm, and when the traffic is heavy. “I used to take the main roads,” he says. “Now I only go on the back routes.” Charlotte Dalton, 18, lives close to Junction 1 on the M3 in west London and suffers from bronchitis, also caused or aggravated by air pollution. “I have lived on Staines Road West for 16 years,” she tells me. “Whenever the windows are opened, car fumes fill the house. When I suffer, it hurts to cough and it’s painful to talk. I’ve had to take a week off school to recover at times.” “I’m relying heavily on meds today,” a colleague tells me. “People on the tube were giving me that wary, angry look they give constant coughers – I felt as if I should be wearing a sign that says, ‘It’s not contagious, it’s asthma.’ ”     Buses on Oxford Street, in London, which has been dubbed the world’s most polluted street. ‘Bollocks,’was Boris Johnson’s response. Photograph: Justin Kase/Alamy    “Diesel is the real villain,” says Simon Birkett, a former City banker who gave up his job to set up an air action group in 2007. Petrol fumes may be bad for health, but diesel engines pump out nearly 65% more particulate pollution and nearly 20 times as much nitrogen oxide gases as petrol cars over their lifetimes. Moreover, their particulates are often smaller and more likely to get into the bloodstream. “What is extraordinary,” Birkett says, “is that, even though the European commission, national governments and the car industry know how dangerous diesel is, together they incentivised it and deliberately engineered a massive switch away from petrol – without any public debate.” History, he says, may show that the rise in heart disease and other illnesses now linked to air pollution has coincided with the increase in awareness of another environmental problem: climate change. And that a botched attempt to address the one has exacerbated the other. In the 1990s, climate change was rising fast up the international agenda and, following the 1997 signing of the Kyoto protocol, rich countries were legally obliged to reduce emissions by an average of 8% over 15 years. But while Japan, China and the US chose to back research into low-emission hybrid, petrol and electric vehicles, Europe prioritised a mass public switch to diesel, announcing that it not only gave 15-20% better mileage to the gallon, but emitted around 13-17% less carbon dioxide, the main climate-changing gas. The motor industry, governments and the green lobby reasoned that it would be one of the cheapest and easiest ways to tackle climate change.    Was my health, and that of millions of others, cynically traded off against the urgency to control climate emissions?    By any measure, the transformation of the European car fleet from almost entirely petrol to predominantly diesel was rapid and remarkable. Britain, along with Germany, France and Italy, offered subsidies and sweeteners to persuade car makers and the public to buy diesel. Key to the change was the 1998 Acea voluntary agreement between the European commission and all European car makers, backed strongly by then EU transport commissioner Neil Kinnock and UK environment secretary John Prescott. This committed all car makers selling in Europe to reduce their average CO2 emissions for new passenger cars by 25% over 10 years. It was practically an order to switch to diesel. At the demand of industry, Britain and other countries kept the diesel price below that of petrol, and penalised petrol vehicles with higher road tax bands. Emission standards for MOTs were linked to CO2, and the car and oil industries were set new targets for diesel adoption.     Deaths attributed to long-term exposure to air pollution in 2012. Source: Public Health England 2014    The results were dramatic. From being a quirky consumer choice, diesel went mainstream in the world’s biggest car market. Its share in the UK rose from less than 10% in 1995 to over 50% in 2012. Most taxis and buses are now diesel. With more than 1m new diesels now sold a year, and 9m on its roads, Britain has one of the largest diesel car fleets in the world. The picture is similar across Europe: more than 55% of all new European car registrations are now diesel, and the region has around 100m diesels, compared with just a few million in the US, China and Japan. The diesel fuel market has grown so fast that the EU now imports much of its diesel and exports petrol to the US. Britain is expected to have to triple its imports over the next 10 years. So was my health and that of millions of others cynically traded off against the urgency to control climate emissions? Those working in the UK government in the 1990s recall how climate change trumped any objections from scientists, or from the few people who understood the health implications of a major switch to diesel. One who did understand was David Fisk, chief scientist and policy director in the departments of both the environment and transport in the 1990s. He recalls that there was “concern” in government when it was proposed that diesel be backed over petrol. “The motor manufacturers made a démarche to the department of the environment, showing that a major switch to diesels would lead to a substantial drop in CO2 emissions. Air quality division saw straight away that there was a problem,” he says. “It was hard to see how anyone could construct a trade-off algorithm that made much sense. The solution was to create the national system of air quality standards.” Former Greenpeace chief Stephen Tindale, who was working on air pollution at the same time, in the department of the environment, remembers a battle between environment and air pollution divisions, but no public debate about health. “British politicians have always been poor on air quality,” Tindale says. “It was just not on the political agenda in late 1990s. In 1997, Labour’s policy was for a 20% cut in CO2 emissions by 2020. Tony Blair wasn’t obsessed with climate at that point, but he saw the political and soundbite advantage. The department of health was dozy, with Frank Dobson and then David Blunkett in charge.”     A mother and toddler in Greenwich Park, with the City of London in the distance. Photograph: PA    A very senior civil servant, now retired, who worked in the department and has asked not to be named, said that cost-benefit studies of a switch to diesel were done, but climate change was “the new kid on the block” and long-term projections of comparative technologies were not perfect. “I recall all the discussions had the health issue as a significant factor,” he says. “We did not sleepwalk into this. To be totally reductionist, you are talking about killing people today rather than saving lives tomorrow. Occasionally, we had to say we were living in a different political world and everyone had to swallow hard.” Former environment minister Barry Gardiner has admitted fault, telling Channel 4’s Dispatches TV programme last year that it was the “wrong decision” to incentivise the purchase of diesel vehicles. But Michael Meacher, environment minister at the time, says he cannot recall ever being consulted on the proposed switch to diesel by his civil servants: “If it had been a question of a trade-off between carbon emissions and health, much as I would have wanted to reduce climate emissions, the medical effects would have trumped it. I would have been keen to see a major reduction in [carbon] emissions, but I would not have wanted that to be at the price of lives.” Frank Kelly now thinks that thousands of people – many with conditions like mine – may be dying prematurely in Britain each year because of the decision to cut carbon emissions at the expense of air pollution, without exploring alternatives. Even worse, it now emerges that Britain and Europe may have only marginally reduced their carbon emissions from transport by switching to diesel, and possibly did not reduce global warming levels at all. Over the last few years, scientists have found that the fine particles emitted by diesel engines play a far bigger role in global warming than many previously thought. The smallest particles, known as “black carbon”, trap heat in the atmosphere and are now thought by some to be second only to carbon dioxide as a driver of global warming. Back in London, I went to Oxford Street, last year cited by King’s College air researcher David Carslaw to be the most polluted street in the world, a “diesel corridor” used by thousands of buses a day. According to Carslaw, it had some of the highest concentrations of NO2 gas measured in any street in the world. London mayor Boris Johnson was offended by this suggestion, responding furiously that it was “bollocks”, but no one, Carslaw says, has disproved it. Since then, Johnson has promised the world’s first ultra-low emission zone from 2020, and has launched a campaign to warn parents to choose less polluting routes to take their children to school.    A toddler was given a carbon monitor: most of the pollution she breathed in came in two hours, going to and from nursery    Outside Selfridges, I met Marie Bristow from Bexley, who had taken a day off work to go shopping. It was a hot day, she’d come up by bus and train and London’s air was officially “good quality”. “I only come when I have to,” she says. “No one likes the air here. It’s the buses, isn’t it? I go back in the evening and it takes me hours to recover. My sister worked here for years and wheezed all the time.” The NO2 may be bad on Oxford Street, but it’s the fine particles in diesel fumes that concern researchers most. Carslaw’s colleague Ben Barratt last year gave portable carbon monitors and GPS watches to seven south London residents, including a pensioner, a cycle courier, an office worker, an ambulance driver, a school pupil and a toddler. He then measured the greatly varying amounts of pollution the volunteers breathed in as they went about their days. Over a 24-hour period, the ambulance driver was exposed to the highest levels, because the traffic exhaust was entering the cab of his vehicle; the cyclist was exposed to half that, and the lowest levels were inside the office worker’s building. Most of the pollution that a toddler breathed occurred in just two hours on the journey to and from her nursery in a pushchair; and the school pupil was exposed to more pollution when travelling on the bus than when walking home along quieter streets. Other studies show that walking and cycling in back streets is better than car travel. According to Barratt, “This suggests that the exposure to pollution may actually be higher for someone driving a car around busy roads than doing so on a bike. This is a simple message that we can tell people, so we can considerably reduce levels of exposure.” Crucially, his study showed that particulate pollution varied minute by minute, vehicle by vehicle and street by street. “The way to understand air pollution is to see it as cumulative over a person’s life,” he says. “We know it affects birth weight. A baby born with low birth weight has an increased risk of disease in later life. If he or she goes to a school in a polluted place, their lungs will not develop, which further increases the chances of developing cardiovascular or other diseases later. By the end, the likelihood of air pollution finishing you off is higher.” Barratt says the chance of dying from smoking cigarettes is about 10 times higher than from air pollution in the UK, “but on a population scale, the risk is just the same”. Those of us walking and cycling along busy streets are “passive smokers of vehicle exhausts”. He recommends real-time pollution apps developed at King’s, so people can get up-to-date information and plan routes across cities. At the moment these only cover London, but they will soon be extended to other cities. The government, ordered this year by the supreme court to draw up a new UK air-quality plan, has accepted that air pollution costs the economy up to £18bn a year, or a seventh of all NHS spending; but has told Europe that it will not meet legal NO2 limits in London, Birmingham and Leeds for 16 years, and in cities such as Liverpool, Sheffield, Manchester and Glasgow for 10. “Cracking our air pollution problem is a huge challenge,” says Kelly. “Traffic must be reduced, and we must ensure a cleaner and greener element to what remains on the road. This can be achieved through a number of strategies: an expansion of low emission zones, investment in clean and affordable public transport, a lowering of speed limits, a move back from diesel to petrol, or at least a ban on all diesel vehicles not fitted with a particulate filter.” ***    Now the idea of breathing London’s air seems horrible, and the gusting winds of the Welsh hills taste gloriously clean    So was my heart disease caused by cigarettes, or those lungfuls of dirty air in London, Birmingham and Lagos? It’s impossible to say. Best not to look for one simple answer, concludes Hurley. “Personally, I don’t spend much time wondering whether air pollution initiates the heart disease that later causes earlier death, or whether it accelerates disease initiated by other factors. For me, the main point is that it does increase the risk.” Three months after my operation, the idea of breathing London’s air seems horrible, and the gusting winds of the high Welsh hills taste gloriously, absurdly clean. I was lucky to have been given another chance by the extraordinary skills of the surgeons and cardiologists. But the hospital wards full of wheezing people with lungs and hearts permanently damaged by lives spent near busy roads tell another story.",2015-06-20T08:00:10Z,All choked up: did Britain's dirty air make me dangerously ill?,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""f2cf80b56d7dca87fc7864a8fa2f1422e2a1e13d""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/f2cf80b56d7dca87fc7864a8fa2f1422e2a1e13d/0_0_4368_2621/1000.jpg"" alt=""Air pollution"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Pause for breath: A generation ago, the links between air pollution and heart disease were uncertain.

"Gardiner Harris, the South Asia correspondent for The New York Times, wrote a critique of Delhi’s abysmal air quality before fleeing to the US. Since then his story has been re-published by major news websites and shared widely online. Within nine months of the family moving to Delhi, Harris’ eight-year-old son Bram suffered respiratory distress, lost half his breathing ability, and had to take steroids regularly. Then the Harrises agonised if it was ethical to continue living in the city at the cost of their children’s health, especially when they had a choice. They could move elsewhere, while most of the city’s residents were grounded. Everyone he talked to advised him against raising his children in Delhi. A professor of preventive medicine in California said children from some of the most polluted parts of Los Angeles lost most or all use of their lungs. Los Angeles is far less polluted than Delhi.  Another study said children never fully recovered even when they moved to better areas. But surprisingly, the Harrises persisted even after their son suffered another attack of asthma.     A boy swims through floating debris in the river Yamuna in New Delhi, India. Photograph: Harish Tyagi/EPA    The horror story didn’t end there. Harris mentioned the sewage drain that is the river Yamuna, widespread open defecation, shoddy construction that caused sewage to mix with freshwater piped to his house, and congested traffic. These are not special privileges reserved only for those living in Delhi. Open a newspaper on any day in the southern city of Chennai, and you’ll find similar stories. Harris said he finally had enough of the horrors of Delhi, and he was relocating to Washington. Many agreed with him. An article in Firstpost said Delhi “is beyond redemption. It is time to think of transferring the capital to some other place.” NDTV conducted an online poll asking readers if they agreed with Harris. An overwhelming majority did.     The devastating, if slightly over-the-top, account by @GardinerHarris on the dangers of living in Delhi should be a wake up call to all.&mdash; Vikram Chandra (@vikramchandra) June 1, 2015    But pretty soon, offended Indians got on Facebook and Twitter, engaging in their favourite pastime: shoot the messenger.    so this gardiner harris guy came to india for nyt, recall he started with dogs &amp; monkeys. has ended with expats and millionaires. perfect.&mdash; Hartosh Singh Bal (@HartoshSinghBal) June 1, 2015    The Daily O compared Delhi to Dickens’ London of squalor. While adding her share of anecdotes of how terrible the city is for its citizens, especially the poor, the writer accused Harris for his sense of entitlement. She then went on to list the things she loved about Delhi – elegant historic monuments, awesome Indian food – while describing the racism she faced while living in the US. This article served as a rallying call for miffed Indians who shared it again and again, while missing the point. Newslaundry trashed Harris’ article, calling it “the omnibus edition of a drain inspector’s report.” The writer dismissed a bunch of studies Harris cited that connect pollution to a range of illnesses.   For an article that talks in excruciating detail of the cataclysmic effect Delhi’s air has had on the health of the author’s child—and the ethical dilemma faced by expats, whether they should risk raising their loved ones in this godforsaken metropolis—for all those morbid adjectives and gut-wrenching, bile-inducing descriptions, Harris quotes but a single scientific study.  But the critic could find only one other study funded by a maker of air purifiers. He dismissed the World Health Organisation’s alarming values of particulate matter because the Indian government rejected them. Although the lack of scientific studies is not Harris’ fault, Newslaundry reserves its choicest adjectives for Harris. There was not a word on the faulty devices that measure pollution levels. The New York Times is not the only foreign publication to highlight Delhi’s pollution, nor was this the first time Harris has tackled Delhi’s air quality. He wrote an especially sharp article on the toll pollution takes on public health, and he even used Delhi’s annual half-marathon to highlight an issue that affects rich and poor alike. None of those stories elicited this level of outrage. So why did Indians react so negatively to this particular story? Was it because he delivered a parting shot before escaping Delhi?     Seems many are more upset with @GardinerHarris than with urban pollution in India! Is it that they resent that he can leave, but they can&#39;t?&mdash; Salil Tripathi (@saliltripathi) June 4, 2015    Harris’ account of his son’s struggle to take a breath of air humanised an environmental problem that had been discussed in numbers and facts. He showed up the lack of public outrage at the dismal quality of life in the city and highlighted the personal cost of living with pollution.

"Weak draft EU rules for coal plant emissions could result in 71,000 deaths and €52bn (£37bn) of health costs across Europe in the decade to come, according to new research published on Wednesday. A Greenpeace investigation earlier this year found that the coal standards would be more lax than those in China, and the Guardian was able to corroborate claims by the green group that industry had helped to write the pollution rules. The new study commissioned by Greenpeace and the European Environment Bureau analysed the impacts of the watered-down rules, and found that nearly 1,000 deaths and £500m of health costs a year are likely in the UK alone. But it said they could be prevented with technologies such as selective catalytic convertors. Without these, thousands more cases of cardiac and respiratory illness that disproportionately affect children are foreseen by the study.  The paper forecasts a surge in asthmatic symptoms affecting over 2m children aged between five and 19, as well as 200,000 new cases of acute bronchitis among 6-12 year olds. Christian Schaible, a policy manager for the European Environmental Bureau said: “The commission is opting for the cheapest techniques to reduce emissions but the health effects alone will be far more costly than the money saved by coal plant operators. These effects will also be felt by many thousands of European citizens, particularly children, in ways that money cannot quantify.” The cost of installing plant technologies such as activated carbon injections to abate mercury emissions – associated with IQ loss in children – would be less than €0.02 per kilowatt hour, Schaible said. The report’s findings emerged from a modelling study by an independent consultant to the European Environment Agency, which was then combined with emissions data. The paper compared draft European commission emissions standards for pollutants such as nitrogen oxide (NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (PM2.5) and mercury against the best available techniques. The EU’s proposed new limits are currently awaiting examination by an EU working group later this year. After that, they are expected to be formally adopted within the bloc’s industrial emissions directive in 2016. The updated directive would cut NOx and SO2 emissions by around 70% and 50% respectively. But the most effective technologies could deliver more than twice as much, according to the study. “Proposed emission limits for mercury are so lenient that an estimated 85% of European plants are already in compliance and will not have to invest in retrofitting,” the report says.  The Guardian has previously revealed that despite claims by the UK to the contrary, energy industry representatives repeatedly and forcefully pushed for weaker pollution limits at meetings in Brussels.  Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, said: “EU leaders have completely failed to stand up to the energy industry’s pervasive lobbying for weak air pollution limits. If these lax rules are adopted, hundreds of thousands of UK and European citizens will pay the consequences for their political leaders letting polluting industries off the hook.”",2015-05-20T05:01:04Z,"Weak EU air pollution standards risk thousands of lives, says report","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""3b3b324bc585f7da680b0a471e6a3b27e986d891""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432054442632/a573d115-92f9-498d-aaca-31a5d491da74-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""The Brussels' court house appears through the smog above Brussels"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The Brussels courthouse appears through the smog above the city. </span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Benoit Doppagne/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",18,"71,000 deaths across Europe and more than 2m child asthma sufferers likely as a result of draft EU air pollution limits that favour industry, study finds <br>",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432054442979/f5a9c5c1-5d8c-4040-a253-2747090f1f45-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/20/weak-eu-air-pollution-standards-risk-thousands-of-lives-says-report,5,negative
"It is a rare blue-skied day in the city of Baoding, in north-eastern China. It’s not even that clear, but the hazy sky is as blue as it gets here. Most days, the sky is obscured by a thick blanket of smog.  Baoding, a city of 10 million people, was named in February as China’s most polluted city by the Ministry of Environmental Protection, based on air pollution figures gathered for 2014. By mid-May of this year, the city had only enjoyed 16 days of air quality that could be considered “good” by the official classification. “Generally, there is smog on most days,” says Mr Han, aged 66, who has lived in Baoding his whole life. He drives a motorbike that carries a carriage-like trailer, and parks outside the city’s main supermarket to ferry shoppers home for a small fee. “It was much better when I was young – the air was very clean,” he says. “We rarely see blue skies now.” Expecting coal stacks and factories pumping out toxic fumes, I instead see farmland whizzing past the window as I approach Baoding on the high-speed train from Beijing. Even when driving around the city, it’s not immediately obvious what causes the pollution. The outskirts are home to one coal power plant that doesn’t appear to be in use, with no sign of workers and not a wisp of smoke from the big chimneys. Like an increasing number of plants in the province, it may well have been closed down as part of increased governmental anti-pollution measures.    It was much better when I was young – the air was very clean. We rarely see blue skies now  Mr Han        ‘There is smog on most days’: Mr Han, 66, has lived in Baoding his whole life. Photograph: Jennifer Duggan    Yet, on a bad day, Baoding’s pollution levels can rise beyond 300 on the air quality index, which is classed as hazardous for human health. On these days, the smog clings to the city like a thick grey shroud, and its residents are ghost-like shadows moving through the haze. Visibility for driving is reduced and headlights and traffic lights glow eerily, barely visible. Air is not something you can normally taste but, on high-pollution days, there is a metallic tang that catches in the back of your throat. Despite this, many of Baoding’s residents appear hesitant to discuss the city’s new status as China’s most polluted city, and when they do, are often defensive of it. “It’s OK in Baoding,” Mr Zhu tells me, pointing to today’s unusually clear skies. He is manning a food stand outside a small restaurant; over a hot stove, he prepares thick savoury pancakes filled with vegetables. Zhu says that his version of this popular snack food is the best in the city – and although he spends hours outside every day, he is not worried about the pollution, asserting his faith that the central government is doing something to improve the situation. According to official figures, on the day I visit Baoding’s air quality is “good” , despite the fact that the level of PM2.5 particles – considered dangerous because they lodge deep in the lungs – is at 54 micrograms per cubic metre, more than double the maximum daily levels recommended by the World Health Organisation. Baoding is located in the north-eastern province of Hebei, China’s pollution “ground zero” which is home to seven of the 10 cities that are ranked worst in the country for air pollution. Surrounding Beijing and with its industries centred in coal and steel, Hebei gets the blame for many of the Chinese capital’s headline-grabbing “airpocalypses”.     March 2014: a man looks on as a bulldozer piles up garbage to burn on the outskirts of Baoding. Photograph: China Stringer Network/Reuters    Pollution has become a controversial topic in China in recent months. In March, a hard-hitting documentary, Under the Dome, outlining the gravity of the country’s air pollution problem – which is estimated to cause the premature deaths of hundreds of thousands of people each year – went viral online.  The hour-long film, directed by journalist Chai Jing, has been compared to Al Gore’s 2006 film on global warming, An Inconvenient Truth, and was viewed online more than 200 million times before being censored and removed. Duan Chao, a doctor at a traditional Chinese medicine hospital in Baoding, confirms that he sees more patients during bouts of smog. “More people come when the air is not good,” he says. “There are more patients with breathing difficulties, people with coughs.” A traditional medicine called ban lan gen is used to treat respiratory illnesses when the smog is bad.      Solar panels on street lights in Baoding. Photograph: Jennifer Duggan    Duan says that awareness is rising in Baoding about air pollution. He takes a mask out of his pocket that he carries with him at all times. While a number of people are spotted wearing face masks, they are generally flimsy and loose fitting, or are surgical masks, which offer little or no protection against most pollutants. In main cities like Beijing and Shanghai, specialist face masks are widely on sale and many homes have air purifiers – but in Baoding, none of the people I interviewed had one at home. The great irony here is that, in 2010, Baoding was named as a pilot of China’s new project to introduce low-carbon zones: an ambitious plan to use renewable energies to illuminate streets and heat residential buildings. As a result, the city has become a hub for renewable energy companies, including Yingli Solar, one of the world’s largest photovoltaic manufacturers.  Yingli is based in a massive industrial park less than 20 minutes drive from downtown Baoding. The complex seems to go on for miles, with solar panels lining the streets. A new building is under construction with walls made from solar panels; its slogan repeats Yingli’s mission to provide pollution-improving, affordable solar energy for all.  At Yingli, Ma Hongha, dressed in blue overalls, heads to start her shift with two of her colleagues. “Many people in Baoding work in this industry,” Ma says, adding that it is important for the city’s economy. She is reluctant to discuss the pollution, but acknowledges it has got worse since she was a child. But, she adds, “Baoding is improving. More solar panels will mean the world will be cleaner.” The industrial area is also home to a number of manufacturers of blades for wind turbines, including Zhong Hang Huiteng Wind Power, one of the largest blade makers in the world. On the edge of the industrial park, turbine blades almost the length of a football pitch are loaded on to flatbed trucks for transportation. In total, around 170 companies related to renewable energy are located in Baoding. Yet still the mystery of the city’s pollution was unclear to me. The city doesn’t have a high concentration of industrial plants around it; there are a lot of cars on the roads and car dealerships are plentiful, but that couldn’t account for the high levels of pollution. Local residents didn’t seem to know, either, or were reluctant to discuss it, though some blamed the weather and pollution from neighbouring cities.    The great irony is that, in 2010, Baoding was named ​as ​a pilot of China’s project to introduce low-carbon ​zones          A wind turbine blade is loaded on to a flatbed truck. Photograph: Jennifer Duggan    It was only when I came across local news reports that the cause of the city’s pollution became clearer. According to preliminary findings of an analysis carried out across Hebei, much of Baoding’s pollution comes from coal-fired steam boiler systems used in more than 100 provincial villages close to the city. These boilers are extremely polluting. Tackling air pollution has become a national priority and, last year, premier Li Keqiang declared “war” on pollution. With its economy still largely reliant on coal-fired industries such as steel and cement, Hebei province is an important battleground in that war – with its authorities faced with the difficult task of balancing economic growth and environmental welfare. Already some parts of Hebei are feeling the impact as plants are closed in an attempt to improve the smog in Beijing. The city’s Communist Party chief, Nie Ruiping, was quoted as saying: “It’s necessary to close some traditional factories to fight air pollution. We cannot sacrifice the environment to make money.” By harnessing the energy of its new industries, perhaps Baoding will not keep its unwanted new title for long.

"The financial cost of air pollution in Europe stands at more than $1.6tn (£1.5tn) a year, a study by the World Health Organisation (WHO) has found, equating to about a tenth of the GDP of the continent. While air pollution has long been known to be a major environmental burden, the costs in human and economic terms have not been categorised before.  The costs come in the form of 600,000 premature deaths each year, and the sickness caused to hundreds of thousands of other people from preventable causes, such as pollution from small particles that come from the exhausts of diesel vehicles, and nitrogen dioxide, a gas that can inhibit breathing in vulnerable people. The figures are from 2010, the latest year for which full data is available, and cover the whole of the European region, including non-EU states such as Norway and Switzerland, and are compiled by the WHO Regional Office for Europe and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).  Zsuzsanna Jakab, regional director for Europe at the WHO, said: “Curbing the health effects of air pollution pays dividends. The evidence we have provides decision-makers across the whole of government with a compelling reason to act.” In many east European countries, the WHO data shows, the economic costs of dirty air are more than 10% of their GDP. On absolute economic costs, the top 10 list is dominated by major economies including the UK, Germany and Italy. In the UK, air pollution has become so bad in London that the European Union is to levy fines on local government, reflecting years in which the extent of pollution has been in excess of EU standards. The Supreme Court is expected to issue judgment on Wednesday on a case brought against the UK government for its breach of EU pollution limits. The WHO report found that air pollution was the single biggest environmental health risk in Europe, with the damage from outdoor risks such as diesel exhaust pollution accounting for 482,000 deaths in 2012 from heart and respiratory diseases alone. The deaths or sickness of at least one in four Europeans can be traced to environmental pollution, according to the organisation.  In March, the European Environment Agency warned that hundreds of thousands of people would die prematurely over the next two decades from air pollution because of governments’ failure to act. However, the issue of air pollution has attracted little political attention in the UK, and has played little part in the current general election campaigns by the major political parties.

"The supreme court has ordered the government to make plans for tackling the UK’s air pollution problem, which has been in breach of EU limits for years and is linked to thousands of premature deaths each year. London and several other British cities have failed to meet EU standards on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels since 2010, running the risk of fines from Brussels and prompting a legal challenge by NGO ClientEarth.   Guardian Keep it in the Ground petition   On Wednesday, five judges unanimously ruled in the group’s favour and said the next environment secretary must draw up a plan to meet the EU rules by the end of 2015. The NGO’s lawyer, Alan Andrews, said: “Air pollution kills tens of thousands of people in this country every year. We brought our case because we have a right to breathe clean air and today the supreme court has upheld that right.” The legal battle revolved around whether the UK had fulfilled its obligations under the EU air quality directive which came into force in 2010. The outcome of today’s case could force the government to take bolder action on anti-pollution measures such as congestion charging zones.  Around 29,000 people die prematurely each year in the UK because of air pollution, according to Public Health England, and that figure is expected to be revised upwards later this year to take into account the health impacts of NO2. The pollutant is a byproduct of diesel vehicles, and can cause breathing difficulties in vulnerable people, such as asthmatics and older adults, and can stunt the proper growth of lung function in children. Diesel car sales overtook petrol ones in 2010 and now account for a third of the UK fleet, partly becuase of favourable taxation.  Mayor of London Boris Johnson last year called for a diesel scrappage scheme to tackle air pollution after researchers said Oxford Street had the highest NO2 concentrations in the world, a call echoed by the City of London Corporation in response to the supreme court’s ruling. Health and environment campaigners welcomed the court’s verdict.  Mike Hobday, director of policy at the British Heart Foundation, said: “Today’s ruling sends a clear message to the government: they must put plans in place to clean up the UK’s dirty air. The government has a duty to protect public health and ensure the air we breathe is safe - a duty they have so far failed to fulfil.” “The public want our politicians to talk more about environmental issues during this election campaign,” said Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace. “The judgement today shows why – systematic failure on air pollution means we need better plans to stop fuel burning in city centres from impacting our health and well-being.”  A Defra spokeswoman said: “Air quality has improved significantly in recent years and as this judgement recognises, work is already underway on revised plans to meet EU targets on NO2 as soon as possible. It has always been the government’s position to submit these plans before the end of this year. Meeting NO2 limits is a common challenge across Europe with 17 member states exceeding limits.” Maria Eagle, shadow environment secretary, said: “This supreme court ruling is a damning indictment of the Tory-led government’s total failure to tackle the UK’s air pollution which is causing tens of thousands of early deaths each year. “Labour will deliver a national framework for low emission zones to enable local authorities to encourage cleaner, greener, less polluting vehicles to tackle this silent killer.” On Tuesday, a study by the World Health Organisation put the financial cost of air pollution in Europe stands at more than $1.6tn (£1.5tn) a year. The WHO report was the first attempt to quantify the cost in economic terms. The UK is not the only country in breach of EU air safety limits, with the European Environment Agency warning earlier this year that inaction by governments would see hundreds of thousands of Europeans die prematurely from pollution in the next 15 years.

"Air pollution causes babies to be born smaller, according to a study of babies born just after the Beijing Olympics. The research surveyed the birth weights of 83,672 babies born in Beijing around the time of the 2008 Olympics, when the government closed down industry, raised vehicle emissions standards, stopped construction and introduced a license plate rotation to slash the number of vehicles on the road. The massive state intervention created a one-off natural laboratory in which air pollution levels in one of the most choked cities on Earth reduced by between 18% and 59% during the summer of 2008. Birth weights were an average of 23g higher for babies who were in the eight month of pregnancy during the summer of the Games than during the same period in 2007 and 2009 . “These findings not only illustrate one of the many significant health consequences of pollution, but also demonstrate that this phenomenon can be reversed,” said associate professor David Rich, a health scientist from the University of Rochester in the US.    Related: Air pollution increases chances of low birth-weight babies    “Even a short term reduction in pollution in a community has a very large public health impact. Some of these babies will have fewer complications or diseases later in life. So any time we can improve or increase birth weight we’re protecting not only the babies when they are born, but also in later life,” he said. Rich said that when the results were extrapolated beyond Beijing’s smoggy suburbs the total impact of air pollution was massive. “A major percentage of the world’s population lives in environments with pollution levels this high. You could name a lot of those cities in China and India. But this shouldn’t be thought of as only a problem in cites with very high air pollution. Even in cities that have lower pollution we see effects on birth weight.” Mothers who were between one and seven months pregnant during the Beijing Olympics gave birth to babies of a similar size in all three years studied. Rich said the short period of lower pollution, and these mothers’ subsequent exposure to higher levels before giving birth, did not prove that no positive effect occurred from cleaner air during the early months of pregnancy. But the study showed that during late pregnancy air pollution was restricting the fastest phase of foetal development. Rich said this was likely due to a restriction of nutrient delivery through the placenta, but the precise reason was unknown. Air pollution has been identified as one of the biggest environmental health risks facing people worldwide. Long term exposure has been shown to cause millions of deaths.     A woman wearing a face mask to protect her from poor air quality. The wall behind her reads “scientific development and amazing achievement”. Photograph: Feng Li/Getty Images    The new study, published on Tuesday in Environmental Health Perspectives, follows other work that has shown pollution can have an insidious effect even before our lungs have started breathing air.  Jonathan Griggs, a paediatric professor at Queen Mary University of London, said it strengthened this body of evidence. He said that 23g was a small impact on an individual child, but the impact for some vulnerable children would be larger and could push thousands of children in Beijing into a “clinically significant low birth weight” category of below 2.5kg. “It absolutely does matter because this is showing that dirty air breathed in by mothers can have adverse effects on the developing foetus,” said Griggs. Children born at a clinically low weight are at greater risk of dying in infancy and are more susceptible to disease. Studies have also linked low birth weight to asthma and decreased lung function in adulthood. “I wonder, hypothetically, if you told women that drinking bottled water vs tap water would increase their foetus’ growth by on average 23g - would they dismiss this as irrelevant? It should therefore be the right of all pregnant women to have as clean air as possible,” said Griggs.",2015-04-28T18:00:08Z,"Air pollution causes low birth weight, Beijing study shows","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""7b2cf099953896e8f498ff2ec54c9043f9725abe""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/28/1430232168469/f6aff567-823d-4022-92c1-230a782e404c-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""A child looks at a congested Beijing road.

"The Supreme Court has been asked to issue a legal order forcing the British government to comply with European air quality limits intended to curb the 29,000 deaths that are caused by pollution every year. A 2015 deadline set by the EU to reduce concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide and particulate matter has already been missed, and the government has refused to guarantee that an alternative plan it is working on will be ready before the year’s end. The Supreme Court had previously ruled that the UK was in breach of its obligations under the EU’s air quality directive in a long-running case brought by the environmental attorneys ClientEarth. Asked in court on Thursday by Lord Sumption what more the plaintiffs hoped to get, ClientEarth’s appellant Ben Jaffey replied: “What I can get in addition is a mandatory order requiring preparation of a new air quality plan that complies with the law.” ClientEarth wants measures such as low emissions zones, road pricing and congestion charging introduced in the shortest timeframe possible, preferably three months.  The government argues that it is already preparing a “game-changing” alternative plan and that with an upcoming election, such deadlines would be impossible to meet. For the UK’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), Kassie Smith QC said that cutting NO2 emissions was “extremely complicated” and that the government believed it had been left discretion to determine appropriate measures for doing so.   Dear Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust: Here are 180,000 reasons to lead on climate change   “Reducing nitrogen dioxide levels is neither easy nor quick and so plans will be focused and detailed,” she told the court. “These are issues that take a great deal of time to address because of the nature of the pollutant and the nature of the sources of the pollutant.” Last year 700 police officers were deployed on the streets of Paris to enforce an alternating ban on cars with odd or even license plates, in a bid to cut the city’s air pollution by one half. The government halted the scheme after one day, claiming success, although studies have questioned the effectiveness of such heavy-handed measures. Defra plans to carry out consultations on potential measures that could be introduced in the autumn, before submitting a new air quality plan to Brussels by the end of the year. But this would be both “a very tight timetable,” and “difficult to do,” Smith said. Such talk raises suspicions for the environmental law lobby, partly because a previous air quality plan devised by Defra in 2011 did not envision full compliance with the EU limits until an unspecified time before 2030. “We can’t just take Defra’s word for it,” Alan Andrews, a lawyer for ClientEarth told the Guardian. “The court needs to step in and force Defra to come up with a new plan that complies with EU law in the shortest timespan possible. We can’t rely on vague assurances given by the government.” The issue could have far-reaching public health effects. A survey in 2010 found that safe levels had been breached in 40 out of 43 areas for emissions of nitrogen dioxide (NOx), which is produced by cars and power stations. Levels were four times over the legal limit in choked London thoroughfares like Lambeth Road in Brixton and Putney High Street in Wandsworth. A green light for plans to expand Heathrow airport could lead to even greater breaches of EU and UK air quality laws, according to a report published by environmental consulting firms, Clean Air Thinking and Environmental Resources Management, and highlighted by Gatwick airport on Thursday. But after ping-ponging between the British legal system and the European Court of Justice, ClientEarth says that its current attempt to impel government action has reached the end of the road. The supreme court justices are expected to deliver their verdict before the end of the year and the green law group’s minimum expectations are settling on a cautionary order or declaration of the mandatory nature of key elements of the air quality directive. “The government’s plans should then be overturned as unlawful, so that would require a new plan anyway, but we don’t think that would be good enough,” Andrews said. “A mandatory order is urgently needed.”",2015-04-17T09:03:09Z,Supreme Court hears call to force UK government to meet air quality laws,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""61ddab3f9b19e94239500ac57299cfff9da46837""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/17/1429260579418/e63d6625-6fef-4080-ac40-c0fc68231402-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Air pollution over London"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Air pollution over London.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Nick Ansell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>",24,Green law group pushes for courts to issue a mandatory order requiring the environment department to comply with EU air pollution limits in the shortest timespan possible,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/17/1429260579699/e63d6625-6fef-4080-ac40-c0fc68231402-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/17/air-pollution-quality-laws-uk-government-supreme-court,0,negative
"With a neatly trimmed moustache and white doctor’s coat, Dr Krzysztof Czarnobilski, head of internal medicine and elder care at Kraków’s MSWiA Hospital, speaks nervously, his English formal and stilted. His message, though, couldn’t be clearer. The filthy air in Poland’s most picturesque city is making his elderly patients sick, shortening their lives and increasing their isolation. The pollution, he says, worsens cognitive and emotional problems such as dementia and depression, and exacerbates breathing and circulatory disorders. Czarnobilski’s hospital, which specialises in treating the elderly, is a yellow concrete building a short tram ride from Kraków’s medieval centre; its blocky, institutional style a relic of Poland’s Communist past. On winter days, when clouds of black soot hang over the city and pollution readings are especially high, Czarnobilski says the “ambulances queue out here on this street”. Medics inside scramble to keep up with the rush of patients as double the usual number of pneumonia cases arrive, instances of heart attack and stroke jump, and those with breathing problems – such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma – show up in crisis.  Like other medics around Kraków, on days like these Czarnobilski is in the uncomfortable position of advising patients to avoid exercise and stay indoors, a prescription that for the elderly is at best isolating, and at worst deadly. “The people are very sad on these days,” he says. “They are lonely in their flats, and this depression is very, very harmful for their health.” Kraków, an elegant city dotted with the remnants of its history as Poland’s royal capital, suffers from the dirtiest air in a country plagued by severe pollution. Much of it is created by the widespread burning of cheap coal in old home stoves, producing smoke rife with carcinogens like dioxins and benzo(a)pyrene, as well as the small sooty particles that are strongly linked to heart, breathing and even cognitive ailments. The cars that clog Kraków’s roads and the coal-fired power plants nearby add to the problem.     ‘There is a day during autumn when you open the window and you know that it’s started.’ Photograph: Artur Widak/NurPhoto/Corbis    “There is a day during autumn when you open the window and you know that it’s started,” says Michal Olszewski, a former environmental activist who is now Kraków bureau chief for the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper. He is talking about residents’ burning of coal, wood, even of plastic bags and bottles for heat. For Olszewski’s children, aged nine, seven and three, “the same story begins: they start coughing, and they cough and cough until March or April”. In the leafy neighbourhood of Bronowice, where coal use is particularly high, Monika Bielak and Bogdan Achimescu hurry their boys past the playground after school, foregoing a stop in order to get them more quickly into the filtered air of the family’s home. Achimescu once had a nosebleed that lasted for 20 hours. All through the winter heating season, he and his wife administer breathing medication through a nebuliser to both of their sons almost every night, with steroids added in when their coughing gets especially bad. Nine-year-old Julek isn’t growing fast enough, so he gets a daily injection of growth hormone too. Their father doesn’t know if that problem is pollution-related, but he does wonder. Even the recently deceased family dog suffered from a cough.     A photograph by Monika Bielak documenting her neighbours’ pollution. Photograph: Monika Bielak    What happened when Achimescu saw a doctor about his nosebleed? “He laughed at me. He said ‘What are you expecting? You’re living in Kraków’. I had the same reaction from the pulmonologist.”  Bronowice’s pollution levels are among the city’s highest because of its many single-family homes whose residents are more likely to use coal than people living in flats, where gas or district heating networks are more often available. “During winter we are like prisoners really,” staying in all afternoon and evening, Bielak says. “The air is stinking, it’s horrible, it’s dirty.”  The couple have bought an electrocatalytic filter, a slim white device about two feet tall which sits next to the dining table and runs for months on end. Achimescu says it brings levels of the tiny, dangerous particles known as PM10 in the lounge, where Julek and Jasiek sleep, down to 50 micrograms per cubic metre – more than twice the World Health Organisation’s recommended safe level. Bielak shows a photo of heavy black smoke pouring from the chimney of the big, pale-pink house across the street. The couple reject the notion that it is only the poor who depend on dirty fuel. “There’s a gynaecologist nearby, she has a big SUV and a big chimney that spits smoke,” Achimescu says. “There’s this whole idea that this is related to poverty. It’s a nice story and the politicians love it, but in fact it crumbles when you compare it to reality,” he says.  Levels of the small pollution particles that penetrate deep into a human body sometimes reach six times the safe levels in Kraków. Benzo(a)pyrene can hit eight times the recommended maximum, according to the activist group Kraków Smog Alarm, which likens each resident’s exposure to the toxin to what they would get from smoking 2,500 cigarettes a year.  But the city is trying to change that. Ranked by the European Union as having Europe’s third dirtiest air,topped only by Pernik and Plovdiv in Bulgaria, Kraków became the first in Poland to approve a ban on the use of solid fuels such as coal and wood for home heating.      ‘Get a Grant, Replace your Furnace’. A post in Kraków tells householders how they could get financial support for the changeover from coal. Photograph: Kamil A Krajewski/www.studioluma.pl/Krakow Smog Alert    Scheduled to come into force in 2018, the new law was deemed invalid last year by a regional court – but it remains on the books until an appeal is decided. Meanwhile national politicians, with the backing of Poland’s right-leaning government, are seeking to circumvent the decision with a bill that would give regional authorities throughout the country the power to regulate coal, vehicles and other sources of pollution. With €100m from Brussels, Warsaw and the regional authority, Kraków officials are also pushing forward with financial incentives aimed at getting city residents to junk their old coal stoves in favour of gas, electricity or a hookup to Kraków’s district heating system, which pumps heat to users from large central boilers. The city is reimbursing eligible residents for the full cost of a new boiler, but the fraction covered will fall as the ban’s start date draws closer. Even opponents of the ban don’t deny Kraków has a serious problem. But they blame transport and industry for the pollution, and say prohibiting home coal use will hit the poorest. Filling his old Mercedes hatchback with sacks of the stuff on the edge of Kraków, Zbigniew Jędrygas says that when his shed is stocked with a tonne of coal: “I am secure and I can sleep well.”  With an estimated 30,000 coal boilers scattered around Kraków, change won’t be easy, or cheap. The fuel some call “Polish gold” is embedded in the country’s culture and history, providing nearly 90% of its electricity and giving Poles a feeling of freedom from their feared neighbour Vladimir Putin and his gas pipelines. And for users, at least, it is a lot less expensive than the alternatives.      A brazier of coal burns for public use in Kraków city centre. Photograph: Kacper Pempel/Reuters    At Grzegorz Rumin’s coal lot, beside a railway track on the southern edge of Kraków, deep black coal sits in big, open piles and the air is heavy with dust.  Every 10 minutes or so, a customer pulls in, and Rumin or one of his workers uses a truck-mounted scoop to dump coal into an open trailer, or shovels it into sacks to be hauled home in a car boot. Rumin, a slim man in work boots and a frayed, blue hoodie, says sales are down since he entered the business in 1998, when schools, other big institutions and many more homes used coal for heat. Back then, he says, the lot sometimes sold 100 tonnes a day. Now “the best day is 20, 20-something” tonnes, but even that is unusual. Indeed, only about 7% of Kraków’s households currently use coal, according to the Kraków Institute for Sustainable Energy. The number has fallen over the years and is, as a proportion, much lower than elsewhere in Poland. But Kraków’s population density and its location in a valley mean its air, officially at least, is the country’s worst. Many suspect pollution is even higher in small towns that lack sophisticated monitoring equipment. Rumin alternates between fury and exasperation when the subject of the ban comes up. His business will close if the law stands. Local officials, he thinks, have misdiagnosed the problem and have their priorities upside-down. “Look at Paris, for example,” he says. “What do they use for heating? Do they also use coal? I think not, but they also have smog. It’s not about coal.”  Rumin says he has customers whose homes lack running water or sewerage pipes. Meanwhile, Kraków’s officials “are saying they will provide people with gas heating systems. How can they do it if there are some families that do not even have such basic things?”     Coal-seller Grzegorz Rumin faces dwindling demand as the 2018 ban approaches. Photograph: Beth Gardiner    In a sunny office near Kraków’s central square, Anna Dworakowska and a handful of her colleagues provided the push that allies and adversaries agree prompted lawmakers to approve Kraków’s groundbreaking ban. Dworakowska’s group, Kraków Smog Alarm, gathered 17,500 signatures in 2013 and placed billboards and posters around the city with slogans such as: “I already have asthma, I don’t need cancer.” Hundreds of people participated in demonstrations, some pushing empty buggies to represent the children forced to stay indoors because of dirty air. “There were placards reading ‘Sophie: She doesn’t go out, she hasn’t been in fresh air for two months now,’” Dworakowska recalls.     An anti-pollution poster from Kraków. Photograph: Kraków Smog Alert    Their cause has now become mainstream; even Poland’s pro-coal government is targeting home use – perhaps because it is easier than confronting big power companies about the emissions from their coal-fired plants. Before the campaign, Dworakowska says, the “media would write maybe three articles about air pollution at the beginning of the heating season, the first smoke episode, and then they would quit. Because how many times can you write about the same thing? But we’ve had more than 1,000 media articles now, it’s the main topic, everybody speaks about it. I think that’s something we’ve definitely changed.” For Dr Czarnobilski at the MSWiA Hospital, the change can’t come fast enough. As workers renovating the emergency room downstairs from his office hammer and shout, he sits thoughtfully behind his dark, polished wooden desk. His patients, he says, often respond angrily when he urges them to stay indoors. “Their depression begins to get deeper and deeper. If an old patient stays at home and doesn’t move,” he says, before trailing off, “ … what else? Stay in bed, and finally die.” Travel and research for this article were funded by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting",2015-04-13T08:46:47Z,"'The air is stinking, it’s dirty': the fight against pollution in Kraków","<figure class=""element element-image element--showcase"" data-media-id=""e526c13dfdeb51964953efcb379b73201959db57""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/8/1428488883894/854a928d-ffe6-480e-a951-2908c56574e6-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""We Want Air!

"This spring is proving to be a repeat of last year. On 23 March, Paris banned odd number plate cars once again to bring particle pollution under control. As in 2014 this was accompanied by days of free public transport and reduced speed limits. Once again the polluted air also covered most of the UK. Londoners experienced the top level of ten on the UK pollution scale on 17 March and levels between seven and nine were widespread; only the highlands of Scotland and north Wales escaped. Further particle pollution returned in early April. Warnings were provided for vulnerable people but no action was taken to control pollution sources. NHS 111 and GP consultations for breathing problems increased last spring’s pollution episodes; there were around 1,600 extra GP consultations during the March episode and 2,700 in the April one. Controlling air pollution would be helped if we knew which sources were the most harmful. To answer this question scientists traditionally compare measurements of one pollutant at a time to death and hospital statistics. But, in the real-world, we breathe a mixture of pollutants. Our spring pollution episodes have been dominated by so-called secondary particles that form when diesel exhaust, industrial pollution and agricultural emissions mix. These can drift over hundreds of kilometres. A new study from King’s College London separated days according to different pollutant mixtures and health data. Days dominated by secondary particles, such those in March and early April, were followed by 2% more deaths from breathing problems.",2015-04-12T20:30:10Z,Pollutionwatch: Groundhog spring,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""dfea0138c9bb703cebbb71419a3cb382fe9e1fb4""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/10/1428683079499/2e1628cd-b772-4869-b175-4bbaf48b1c57-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Smog smothers Ramsgate beach in the early hours of last Friday morning."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Smog smothers Ramsgate beach in the early hours of last Friday morning.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Stefan Wermuth/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>",26,<strong>Gary Fuller</strong> on the severe particle pollution that affected most of the UK in March and early April – just like last year,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/10/1428683079760/2e1628cd-b772-4869-b175-4bbaf48b1c57-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/12/air-pollution-level-ten-breathing-problems,8,negative
"A major spike in air pollution across much of England poses a risk to those suffering from respiratory diseases, older people and children, health charities warned on Friday. The government pushed its smog alert levels to “very high” - its most extreme pollution warning - for some parts of south east England. In Brighton, Eastbourne and Hastings the official advice is for all residents - regardless of their health - to reduce their physical exertion. Older people and children on Easter school holidays have been urged to avoid any strenuous activity at all. In other areas of England, particularly the south east and Midlands, the smog levels will be high enough to cause problems for those with pre-existing problems. Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation (BLF), said: “To reduce the impact, people who find their health affected can take simple steps such as avoiding busy roads, especially during rush hour, and refraining from strenuous exercise outside.” The event closely follows another high level pollution event in March. Professor Malcolm Green, founder of the BLF, said long term exposure to air pollution was “associated with lung diseases including asthma, as well as lung cancer, and can make symptoms worse in those with pre-existing respiratory conditions. The effects of air pollution depend on the severity of exposure, length of exposure, and susceptibility of the individual”. Asthma UK told asthma sufferers to carry their inhalers at all times. Especially as the high pollution event was due to combine with increased pollen counts. “Poor air quality and pollen allergy can both trigger asthma symptoms, and increase the chance of a potentially life-threatening asthma attack. Children can be more affected by pollution because they have faster breathing rates, and their lungs are still developing,” said an Asthma UK advisory. Woods said it was unfair that those suffering asthma and other lung conditions should be repeatedly forced indoors by air pollution events.  “People living with lung conditions shouldn’t have to take such steps simply to avoid being made ill by the air they breathe. With periods of high pollution often resulting from a combination of domestically-produced pollution and that coming from mainland Europe, we need urgent action from government to clean up the air we breathe, across all government departments at home and at a pan-European level.” Keith Taylor is the Greens MEP for the south east, the area most heavily affected by Friday’s event, said the problem should be a national priority. “Whoever forms the next government, one of the first things they must do is to urgently address this public health crisis that currently only seems to be getting worse.” Simon Birkett, director of campaign group Clean Air in London, said: “This is the biggest, most serious air pollution or particle episode since the so-called Sahara dust episode a year ago. “If there is one lesson this week, it’s that we must follow the lead of cities like Paris that are issuing public health warnings, restricting traffic and putting forward ambitious plans to triple cycling rates within five years.” The slow moving cloud of smog is being fed by a sluggish southerly weather system, which is also responsible for this week’s warm spring weather. Dr Helen Dacre, a meteorologist at the University of Reading, said: “Southerly flow will lead to pollution being imported from the industrialised urban parts of Europe. This pollution will blow across Britain and add to the local pollution produced by British car drivers and heavy industry, creating high concentrations of pollutants in the air. On Saturday however, the weather will change. Clean Atlantic air will spread across the UK and pollution will return to low levels.” Northern Europe, especially France, will be cloaked in a thick shroud of smog for much of Friday. In Paris and northern cities the government has reduced all traffic speed limits by 20km/hr. Residential parking has been made free in Paris to encourage people to leave their cars at home. In March, Paris implemented license plate bans to take half of all cars from the road.

"The Indian environment minister has promised to tackle his nation’s acute problem with air pollution “better than the rest of the world has ever done” amid growing domestic concern at the health impact on hundreds of millions of people living in the developing nation’s overcrowded cities. In an interview with the Guardian, Prakash Javadekar said the government would announce India’s first nationwide “composite, comprehensive” air index this week. So far, India’s collection of pollution data has been haphazard and compares poorly with regional rival China. The move was welcomed by experts. Sarath Guttikunda, an expert with Urban Emissions, an independent research group, said: “We have been saying that pollution is very bad and now we’ll be able to see that. It’s a first step but it’s not going to solve the problem by itself.” . A survey released last year by the World Health Organisation (WHO) found that Delhi, the Indian capital, was the most polluted city in the world, with an annual average of 153 micrograms of the most dangerous small particulates, known as PM2.5, per cubic metre.   Related: India air pollution 'cutting crop yields by almost half'    The level was six times the WHO’s recommended maximum, 12 times US standards and more than twice the level considered safe by Indian authorities. During the winter, when lower temperatures and fires intensify the pollution, concentrations of PM2.5s and other pollutants routinely spike much higher, reaching levels described by experts as “hazardous” for humans. The problem is not restricted to the capital. Thirteen of the dirtiest 20 cities in the world were in India, the WHO said.  Another survey – the Environmental Preference Index – ranked India 155 out of 178 countries for air quality last year. The local effects of the pollution are increasingly clear. The WHO has also found that India has the world’s highest rates of death from respiratory disease, with 159 per 100,000 in 2012, around 10 times that of Italy, five times that of the UK and twice that of China. “Clean air is a birth right,” said Javedkar, the minister. “We are giving high priority to this. It has not been handled correctly over the last 10 years.” The current Bharatiya Janata party government took power with a landslide victory at an election last year. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, campaigned on a promise of boosting India’s flagging growth and freeing industry from restrictions, including many designed to protect India’s environment. It has been unclear how Modi intends to reconcile growth with protection of India’s forests, rivers and air quality. After being ignored by media and politicians for many years, the toxic air is now becoming a significant domestic issue. This week, major local newspapers ran successive front page stories highlighting the problem. One reported on the impact the pollution was having on children in the capital with a previously unpublished study by scientists from one of the country’s most respected cancer research institutions. The Indian Express newspaper said the research showed children in Delhi suffered significantly more respiratory diseases, including asthma and severe lung disorder, than a control group as well as higher levels of hypertension and hyperactivity. Diminished lung capacity in the children would probably be permanent, the authors concluded. A survey by Greenpeace earlier this year found levels in schools – many of which are located close to roads – that were four times worse than those triggering alerts in London.  Dr Rashmi Rakshit, a 52-year-old associate professor of physics at Delhi University, said she had developed asthma which needed constant medication and and her two adult children also had respiratory problems. “How will only monitoring help? We all know the severity of the problem. The government has to work on finding a solution, not just on highlighting a problem,” Rakshit said. Vandana Bhalla, an interior designer from Delhi’s Shalimar Bagh neighbourhood, said her nine-year-old daughter had been recently diagnosed with symptoms of asthma. “I was not so bothered about it before but now my daughter coughs a lot and when she gets cold she is sick for more than 15 days. Even in summer, she is affected because of this bad air,” Bhalla said. Guttikunda said even though the new public interest and better availability of data would increase pressure on politicians, any rapid improvement would be unlikely.  “It’s really very very bad ... and it’s going to get worse,” he said. Delhi authorities rejected the findings of the WHO study, with government scientists saying the UN agency had overestimated levels in the capital. The claim that Delhi was more polluted than Beijing caused particular irritation among officials.   Related: Beijing smog makes city unliveable, says mayor    Yet there are limits to what Javedkar or other national level ministers can achieve. Delhi is effectively an independent state, and most of the measures that might limit pollution would have to be enacted by local elected representatives and implemented by local officials. One problem has been successive changes of government of Delhi in recent years, which has led to a series of strategies being drawn up and then shelved.  Javadekar blamed four major factors for the particularly acute problem in Delhi: stubble burning on farmland around the capital; sandstorms blowing in from the desert state of Rajasthan to the west; the number of vehicles now on the roads in the capital; and the failure over decades to build a bypass for the 50,000 to 100,000 trucks which drive through Delhi every day to reach other destinations. But he said similar problems existed elsewhere. “Delhi is like hundreds of other [cities] in the world. It is not an isolated example,” he said. The city has had some success combating pollution in the past. Following a 1998 court decision, Delhi converted its bus and rickshaws to compressed national gas, which had a major impact on pollution. But Delhi’s 8,000 buses are only a small fraction of total traffic. Between 1991 and 2011, the population of Delhi and its adjoining cities more than doubled from approximately 10 million to 22 million while the number of registered cars and motorbikes increased from 1.6m in 1991 to around 8m today.  A new metro has made little impact, experts say, as most of its users previously travelled by buses, bicycles or on foot. Car users have remained reluctant to switch to public transport. One Indian study found that concentrations of PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 mm in diameter) could be 50% higher than usually recorded if measured close to roads. This means that drivers in Delhi in winter could be exposed to levels of the most harmful particulates that are 30 or 40 times the WHO safe limits. The problem is compounded by construction and systematic burning of waste. Indian authorities have done little compared with their counterparts in China, where air pollution is one of the top items on the government’s agenda since a choking smog dubbed the “airpocalypse” engulfed key Chinese cities in January 2013. Beijing recently introduced measures to limit the number of motorists on heavily polluted days. Under China’s newly amended environmental law, criminal penalties will be imposed on those found guilty of trying to evade pollution monitoring systems. India is under pressure to disclose its plans to cut green house gas emissions before UN talks from 30 November to 11 December in Paris.  Delhi has so far baulked at committing itself to major cuts, arguing that it will not set itself targets that undermine efforts to end poverty.    Related: India 'walking the talk' on climate change, says environment minister    China announced its plan to cap its emissions by about 2030 in a joint announcement with the US last November.  In January, Modi had said that though “India is an independent country and [under] no pressure ... from any country or any person ... when we think about the future generations, what kind of world are we going to give them, then there is pressure”.",2015-04-05T13:45:52Z,Indian minister promises to tackle country's acute air pollution problem,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""729f5d95ac0351a03cd63e037b0949f0a6c349e1""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/5/1428241161851/f8403067-9eeb-4529-a338-7489c634fb18-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Smog covers buildings in the Indian capital, Delhi.

"Harmful levels of air pollution will accompany the warm weather expected across the UK on Friday, triggering government warnings that people with health problems should reduce their physical activity. Much of central, eastern and northern England will be blanketed in high pollution, according to the official UK Air site, with some of south-east England affected by very high pollution. The episode is blamed on a combination of dirty air from the continent, the fine weather conditions and Saharan dust, which contributed to several days of serious pollution one year ago. Temperatures are expected to reach almost 20C in some areas on Friday.     Air pollution forecast for 10 April. Photograph: UK Air    This week’s warning comes a day after Islamist hackers took control of UK Air, posting a portrait of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and criticising the UK government for the 2003 Iraq invasion. The site, which is run by consultancy Ricardo-AEA on the environment department’s behalf, is still offline but a spokeswoman said they were working to get it up again “as soon as possible”. Pollution forecasts are being posted on a holding page.  In regions hit by high pollution on Friday, the official health advice is for adults and children with lung problems to reduce their physical activity, and for all older people to reduce physical exertion. In the very high areas, which include Brighton, Eastbourne and Hastings, the entire population are advised to reduce physical activity. A Met Office spokeswoman said the settled weather this week meant the pollution episode was likely to happen, but would be blown away by Saturday. “We do have a weak front crossing the UK late on Friday which is bringing some cooler, fresher air behind it. Until then we have these fairly calm, settled conditions which means any pollution buildup doesn’t move, it’s trapped there,” she said. Pollution levels are expected to rise throughout Thursday in advance, but the forecast is for largely low levels by Saturday. Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said: “This latest high air pollution episode, coming so soon after the last, is troubling, and could again put people living with respiratory conditions at risk of worsening symptoms.”  She added: “With periods of high pollution often resulting from a combination of domestically-produced pollution and that coming from mainland Europe, we need urgent action from government to clean up the air we breathe, across all government departments at home and at a pan-European level.”  On Wednesday, the Advertising Standards Authority upheld a complaint against a Transport for London newspaper advert that claimed Boris Johnson’s planned ‘ultra low emissions zone’ would cut vehicle pollution by half. The ASA rejected two other complaints but ruled that the advert’s claim was misleading because it only referred to two pollutants, NO2 and NOx, and did not include CO2, PM10 and PM2.5 emissions, which would not be cut by half. TfL said it would appeal the decision.",2015-04-08T12:57:39Z,Warm weather brings high air pollution warnings for much of England,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""2a531e7c46d377756f678c53af3e092e7dd1f44e""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/8/1428497148271/910f1f93-1baf-4ee5-b908-07036d0602c6-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""A view of London from Primrose Hill Pollution in London, Britain - 03 Apr 2014 view of London from Primrose Hill as high levels of air pollution are continuing to affect parts of the UK, as a rise in emergency calls over related health problems is reported."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A combination of dirty air from the continent, the fine weather conditions and Saharan dust will cause air pollution levels to rise on Friday.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Michael Bowles/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>",29,"Pollution levels will peak on Friday, particularly in areas of south-east England where the government are advising the entire population to reduce physical activity",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/8/1428497148546/910f1f93-1baf-4ee5-b908-07036d0602c6-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/08/warm-weather-brings-high-air-pollution-warnings-for-much-of-england,1,negative
"The death toll from air pollution, usually put at around 29,000 a year in the UK, could be substantially higher because the lethal effect of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), emitted during fossil fuel burning, has not been taken into account, experts believe. Until now, only deaths linked to fine particles, less than 2.5mm in diameter (PM2.5) have been estimated. In cities, these come primarily from cars, lorries and buses but they are also produced by the burning of wood, heating oil or coal for domestic or industrial purposes, or in forest fires.  Deaths from air pollution globally are rising. The Global Burden of Disease study from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle found that there were 3.4 million deaths from outdoor pollution in 2010, which was an increase from three million in 1990. Adding in the effects of indoor pollution, mostly from cooking fires in the developing world, brings the global death toll to seven million a year according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). Policy director at NGO Transport and Environment Jos Dings said the solutions to the air pollution problem would also slash carbon emissions, creating a win-win for human health and the climate. “The more we move our transport system away from hydrocarbons – oil and biofuels – towards electricity, the better it is. This will simulteneously solve the air pollution and climate issues,” he said.  In addition, said Dings, the decline of coal and other fossil fuels, which are also sources of NO2, as sources of power in future would compound the health benefits of a shift to electric transport. “If you look into the future, the additional electricity that will come into the system over the next decades is likely to be very renewable. Three-quarters of the additional capacity that we currently install in Europe in the power sector is wind and solar. The trend is very much in the good direction,” he said.  In Europe, the WHO estimates about 500,000 people die prematurely as a result of air pollution every year. But this death toll may be significantly higher if NO2 were factored in.  Adding those deaths to the count is difficult though, because there is an overlap. It is hard to know which traffic emissions have done harm to people who live alongside major roads. But a WHO report last year concluded that NO2 was an additional cause of death and the UK government’s committee on the medical effects of air pollution (COMEAP) is now attempting to put figures on it.        Dr Heather Walton, senior lecturer in environmental health at King’s College London, said that the relative risks of PM2.5 and NO2 were similar. In the UK, scientists work on a 6% rise in mortality for a 10 microgramme per cubic metre increase in the PM2.5 concentration. The WHO’s health risks of air pollution in Europe (HRAPIE) report put the equivalent mortality increase for NO2 at 5.5%.  But annual average concentrations of NO2 are higher than those for PM2.5. “So, on the face of it, you might expect to get a bigger number for NO2 than for PM2.5. However, it is not as straightforward as that. For one thing, as more polluted places usually have higher levels of both pollutants and both affect mortality, it can be difficult to separate the effects,” said Walton. The WHO report said the overlap could be as much as 33%. It also recommended only calculating the impact of NO2 when concentrations exceed 20 microgrammes per cubic metre. Discussions are now taking place in COMEAP and beyond on how to add in the effects of NO2 on deaths from air pollution, but even though, Walton says, this is “certainly one of the key issues in the field at the moment”, no final number is expected any time soon.    Much depends on where you live with the highest risks close to main roads    The link between air pollution and adverse health consequences is becoming clearer but it was only in the early 1990s that strong research evidence began to be published making the connection. In 1993, Douglas Dockery from the Harvard School of Public Health and colleagues published a study of over 8,000 adults in six US cities suggesting higher levels of fine particles in the air was associated with higher death rates - once smoking was excluded. In 2009, another seminal paper from the same group showed that cleaning up air pollution increased life expectancy.  But much depends on where you live – it is not which city that matters, but where in the city, with the highest risks close to main roads. Walking or cycling along fume-filled streets is clearly an issue, but not as big an issue as living on them. A small study of 50 schoolchildren by Mark Nieuwenhuijsen, a professor at Barcelona’s Center for Research in Environmental Epidemiology demonstrated this year that their exposure was higher when walking back from school, but it was during the 15 hours a day in the home that their exposure to air pollutants was greatest.  This was part of a bigger study looking at the effects of air pollution on children’s cognitive development. This month the group published their paper in PLoS Medicine, showing that children in Barcelona at schools where air pollution is heavier did less well over time in memory and attention tests than their peers elsewhere. The effects on children are of increasing concern. The latest results from a two decade-long study in Los Angeles, published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine last month provided some of the most convincing evidence yet of the effect of air pollution on the growth of children’s lungs.        The paper offered some good news. Levels of NO2 and PM2.5  have dropped by 40% in the urban areas where the children in the study live. James Gauderman, professor of preventive medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California (USC) and his team, who have run the Children’s Health Study for two decades and who first identified a link between air pollution and impaired children’s lung function, report that as a result of the clean-up, today’s children can breathe more easily. In the original 1994-98 cohort of children, 8% had impaired lung function, which often leads in adulthood to respiratory disease and also heart disease. In the 2007-11 cohort, that had dropped to 3.6%. The research is a breakthrough because of the strength of the evidence it provides that fumes and particles are a cause of lung damage. “It’s really, really important, because when you talk about associations with lung growth people say well it’s an association – you haven’t proven there is a link,” says Ian Mudway, lecturer in respiratory toxicology at King’s College London. “But if you then show that actually you can address the deficit by reducing air pollution you go beyond the point of saying it’s an association. You begin to have something which is a much more causal relationship.” Other health impacts Research is now emerging which suggests that the impacts of air pollution go beyond asthma and other respiratory disease as well as heart attacks and strokes. In July 2013, the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE) showed that living near polluting major roads in nine countries in Europe increased the chances of lung cancer. Three months later, the WHO’s International Agency for Research in Cancer (IARC) formally classified outdoor air pollution as a carcinogen, causing both lung and bladder cancers. In October 2013, ESCAPE reported on air pollution and low birthweight babies. Among the participating cities was Bradford in England. As elsewhere, in the Born in Bradford cohort of mothers and babies, there was a higher likelihood of restricted foetal growth if the woman in her pregnancy was living in an area of high air pollution. Low birthweight babies often have health problems in later life. Studies have also shown reduced fertility in areas with high air pollution and links to obesity. There is concern now about cognitive effects as well, with research looking at dementia and neurological degeneration.

"The car industry on Wednesday launched a campaign to “challenge the increasing demonisation of diesel” vehicles. The campaign, launched by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), promotes the credentials of the new Euro-6 standards. This Europe-wide law, which will come into force in September, limits nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from new diesel cars to 80mg/km in order to bring down air pollution levels that breach health regulations in many EU cities. Diesel cars have come in for increasing criticism in the last year for their larger-than-thought emissions of NOx and small particulates. Last year London mayor Boris Johnson proposed a scheme that would pay diesel car owners up to £2,000 to scrap their vehicle and switch to a cleaner model. Diesel was supposed to be the answer to the high carbon emissions of the transport sector, a lower emitting fuel that was a mature technology – unlike electric or hydrogen cars. In the early 2000s the Blair government threw its weight behind the sector by changing ‘road tax’ (vehicle excise duty) to a CO2-based system, which favoured diesel cars as they generally had lower CO2 emissions than petrol versions.  It inspired British car makers to invest heavily in a manufacturing process that most countries outside Europe have ignored. In 1994 the UK car fleet was only 7.4% diesel. By 2013 there were 10.1m diesel cars in the UK, 34.5% of the total.  But studies have since shown that diesel cars’ emissions of other pollutants can have serious impacts on the health of people exposed to them.  Now the European Union is scrambling to reduce the impact of its massive diesel industry on the health of its citizens. Carmakers have had some success in cutting the particulate matter of their engines, but according to recent independent testing, NOx levels remain stubbornly high. A Channel 4 documentary in January called the subsidisation of the diesel industry the “great car con”. In the programme the current shadow environment minister Barry Gardiner MP, who was a member of the Blair government, admitted the policy was a mistake.  “Hands up, can I say there’s absolutely no question that the decision we took was the wrong decision.” In 2014 the European commission took the UK to court for regularly exceeding NOx limits in 16 zones from London to Glasgow. In an attempt to restore consumer confidence the car industry has produced leaflets (available at car markers and dealerships) as well as a “myth-busting” website. The campaign shows the growth of the diesel market and claims success for car makers in reducing emissions of NOx, particulate matter and CO2. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, says: “Today’s diesel engines are the cleanest ever, and the culmination of billions of pounds of investment by manufacturers to improve air quality ... The allegations against diesel cars made in recent months threaten to misguide policy making and undermine public confidence in diesel. It’s time to put the record straight.” But the claims of the industry have been criticised by experts who say the numbers cited by car makers are based on a test that does not represent real-world conditions. For official standards, diesel cars have their emissions tested in a laboratory, but recent testing by the International Council on Clean Transportation found:  On average, real-world NOx emissions from the tested vehicles were about seven times higher than the limits set by the Euro-6 standard. If applied to the entire new vehicle fleet, this would correspond to an on-road level of about 560 mg/km of NOx (compared to the regulatory limit under Euro 6 of 80 mg/km).  The Euro-6 regulations require a real-world test to be introduced, but the timing of this is still being debated. Greg Archer from campaign group Transport &amp; Environment says the car industry has successfully lobbied the European commission to have the likely date for an introduction moved back from 2017 to 2020. “They’ve based it on limits and tests which are carried out in laboratories and don’t represent the amount of pollution that these vehicles actually produce on the road. And they know that.    Keep it in the ground petition   “Carmakers are trying to greenwash dirty diesel to hide the truth that compared to a petrol car a typical new diesel car on the road emits 10 times more nitrogen oxides. While carmakers claim modern diesels are clean they are pushing to delay and weaken the introduction of new pollution tests. This is because most new diesels can’t reach the limits agreed back in 2007 without fitting new technology,” says Archer. An SMMT spokeswoman denied the industry was pushing back on real-world testing. To the contrary, she said, they were very supportive of getting the regime in place “as soon as possible”. “We are waiting for a finalised communication from the European commission, which will set the parameters for the real-world testing. Until we have sight of that, manufacturers cannot commence the additional engineering investment required with any degree of certainty.” Ben Barratt, an air pollution expert from King’s College London, says the early implementation of the new test is critical for the success of the regulations. “In the absense of a real-world test we have to question these figures because history shows us that past performance has not delivered,” says Barrett. “The sooner the real-world test comes in the better, without doubt. Because we will not know whether to trust the Euro-6 figures until that test comes in. Cities around Europe are reliant on Euro-6 delivering the reductions it is supposed to. If Euro-6 doesn’t deliver then many parts of Europe, including London and other cities in the UK, will continue to fail to meet European Union air quality standards.” Councils around the country are beginning to take action to discourage their residents from buying diesel cars. Islington council will introduce a £96 per year diesel vehicle parking surcharge on 1 April. It will be the highest charge of its kind in the country and one of the first such schemes introduced.  Councillor Claudia Webbe said: “Pollutants in diesel exhausts have been linked to heart and lung diseases, which are major causes of serious and long-term health issues and even death in Islington, and the surcharge will encourage a move away from diesel.” But Hawes said the charges made “no sense from an environmental point of view” citing the results from the tests the car industry agrees are flawed. The chairman and managing director of Ford of Britain, Mark Ovenden, says the charges are an unnecessary interference in the market. “We support customer choice and the market should determine the best technologies for meeting CO2 and air quality goals,” he says. But the car market is far from even. The carbon emissions tax regime currently levies £180 on a new petrol-powered Ford Mondeo. The rate for the diesel version is £0. Last month the UK government rejected an environmental audit committee recommendation to remove the tax advantage enjoyed by diesel cars. Signalling it remained supportive of the diesel industry. The SMMT document also says that the furore over diesel’s contribution to air pollution is overblown, given the relatively small contribution (14%) cars make to the nation’s overall NOx emissions. There is a large misconception over who is the real villain, says the website. More than half of those survey by YouGov incorrectly identified cars and commercial vehicles as the biggest cause of air pollution in the UK.  “It would take 42m Euro-6 diesel cars (almost four times the number on the roads) to generate the same amount of NOx as one UK coal-fired power station,” says the Diesel Facts website. But Archer says this is “another example of the car industry greenwashing the figures”. Where the pollution is occuring is more important than how much, he says. “The pollution that comes out of [power stations] is highly disperesed. It’s rather different when you’re a child in a push chair being pushed along a curb breathing in the exhaust fues which are coming out of the cars standing next to you. So in terms of exposure to pollution, vehicles are far, far more important than power stations are.”",2015-03-11T17:54:48Z,Have diesel cars been unfairly demonised for air pollution?,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""7f252ccdb5b50fd234219e177f9c842d544f6d80""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/11/1426094961115/f5af7838-d96a-47f4-8f6c-27adb19ace17-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Mike Hawes, left, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders (SMMT), speaks as car industry executives, from left, BMW Group UK Managing Director Graeme Grieve, Jaguar Land Rover UK Managing Director Jeremy Hicks, Volkswagen Group UK Managing Director Paul Willis and Ford of Britain Chairman and Managing Director Mark Ovenden, look on during the launch of UK nationwide consumer campaign, promoting diesel technology in central London, March 11, 2015."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Mike Hawes, left, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers &amp; Traders, speaks at the launch of a national campaign in London to promote diesel technology.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Lefteris Pitarakis/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>",31,"<strong>Karl Mathiesen: </strong>A new campaign by car makers claims modern diesel engines are clean and have reduced emissions, but experts say they are greenwashing the figures <br>",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/11/1426094961397/f5af7838-d96a-47f4-8f6c-27adb19ace17-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/11/have-diesel-cars-been-unfairly-demonised-for-air-pollution,0,negative
"My ears pop as the car winds its way up the mountainside. On either side, a sheer, vertical drop of over 60 metres looms. Ahead, just before the Mont Blanc Tunnel, is the picturesque French resort of Chamonix, where over 10,000 people live and almost five million tourists visit every year.  Anyone there to enjoy the pure mountain air may be disappointed. Chamonix, like much of the l’Arve Valley, is home to some of the highest air pollution levels in France.  Chamonix has, in a way, become a victim of its own natural beauty. An idyllic winter wonderland situated at the foot of Mont Blanc, it is one of the oldest ski resorts in France, with unparalleled panoramas and mountain ranges that make it a mecca for skiing, gliding and climbing enthusiasts.  What people often don’t see, amid the excitement of a ski trip or weekend getaway, is the industrial plain of Passy below or the sheer amount of traffic that filters through the area every day. Now, as a result of its V-shaped valley, Chamonix is suffering. “Last night, we had the monthly council meeting,” says the mayor of Chamonix, Eric Fournier, as we sit down in his office at the town hall. “Everybody – whether it’s the opposition or not – is in agreement that Chamonix has to be a pioneer in our commitment to improving the air quality.” Fournier is a Chamonix local and the son of a mountain guide, who was first elected mayor in 1995. He has spent the last 10 years trying to find a solution to the town’s pollution problem. “The geographical situation of the valley – the fact that it’s V-shaped – makes it quite encased, so when we have high pressure it basically puts a lid on the valley,” he explains. Rising levels of pollution in the l’Arve Valley first set alarm bells ringing 15 years ago and have worsened ever since, erupting in 2012 when the EU threatened to sue Chamonix for endangering the health of its inhabitants.  Currently, the pollutants affecting Chamonix mostly include fine particles as a result of residential activity such as heating or burning green waste, and nitrogen dioxide from traffic. Another pollutant reaching worrying concentrations is a cancerous organic compound known as Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP). All of these are regulated by European laws, whose daily limits the valley often exceeds. When levels become critical, the alarm is raised.  “At 10am this morning we were at 17 micrograms per cubic metre [for PM10s, fine particulate pollution] ,” Fournier says, scrolling through a website that lists the stats. “We inform the population from 50 onwards and when it hits 80, it becomes critical and an alert goes out.” At that point, physical activity is discouraged. Onscreen, a green box indicates that all is ‘bon’ in Chamonix – for now at least.  Some of the steps that have been taken to combat the rising pollution levels in Chamonix are impressive. They include changes to the public transport system, which is now free throughout the valley for both visitors and residents. This costs the municipality around €5m (£3.6m) per annum, but for Fournier and the local environment, it’s worth it. “Public transport carries three million people every year,” he says. “And that number has tripled since it’s been free.”  I’m aware that I am Chamonix’s worst nightmare, having travelled the 80km from Geneva by car. However, most people living locally know how difficult it is to get here by train and willingly take to the roads – even if that does mean a €6 toll.      Traffic of HGV vehicles through the Mont-Blanc tunnel which links France and Italy is a serious contributor to high-pollution levels in the lArve valley. Photograph: Jean-pierre Clatot/AFP/Getty Images    Now, a new project called Grande Geneve aims to improve the rail network. “At the moment, people can’t really get to Chamonix by train because it’s so complicated,” says Fournier. “You have to change, it takes forever and the Chamonix line is a metric line so the rails aren’t the same width as the main ones. Grande Geneve will make a big difference for us.” Chamonix’s property sector, too, is being transformed, thanks to a local fund that promises to finance 20% of any renovation work. Tax reductions are on offer for homeowners who install sustainable heating systems and many public buildings, such as the library, have been completely redeveloped. In an area where much of the property hails from the early 1900s, particle filters, solar panels and insulation are nothing short of revolutionary. But for all his efforts, Fournier knows that he can’t fix the problem without help from the state. External factors like heavy goods vehicles – a major source of pollution – are ones Chamonix has limited influence over.  HGV vehicles, particularly those travelling through the Mont Blanc Tunnel, have been a headache for Chamonix over the years. Between 1999 and 2002, when the tunnel was closed after a transport truck fire, the air quality throughout the l’Arve region improved dramatically. Wild flowers that hadn’t been seen for years suddenly re-appeared. The entrance to the tunnel, blackened by exhaust fumes, became pearly white.  Today, half a million HGVs still pass through every year, but improvements are well underway – 94% of HGV trips through the tunnel are now made by more environmentally-friendly lorries. As Fournier closes his laptop, I notice three cow statuettes on the corner of his desk. Each one is decorated with the flag of an alpine neighbour – Switzerland, Italy and France. Does he see Chamonix as an example to the world? “Because Chamonix is such a well-known destination it needs to be an example,” he says, smiling. “This is more than just a commitment. It’s a real duty.”",2015-03-05T14:20:14Z,Why does Chamonix have some of the worst air pollution in France?,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""2ce9ac8db9ca7b9aa72066a1d3b79d6fb34ccf46""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/4/1425482918953/5ca2397d-ea9e-48df-8333-e48599f67c49-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""The traffic passing through the tunnel du Mont Blanc creates a layer of pollution above the town of Chamonix, France."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Pure mountain air of Chamonix?

"New limits on air pollution in Europe have been watered down because governments are allowing some of the worst polluters to help draw up the rules, according to a Greenpeace investigation.  The Guardian has also learned that despite UK claims to the contrary, energy industry representatives repeatedly and forcefully pushed for weaker pollution limits at meetings in Brussels. As a result of ongoing lobbying, the proposed European Union standards on toxic emissions from coal plants will be less strict than in China, the green campaign group said.  Greenpeace analysed the backgrounds of hundreds of representatives who have been appointed by governments to sit on a key official group that is formulating new limits on air pollution across Europe. It found that out of 352 members of the technical working group, 183 are either employed by the companies that are being regulated, or by lobby groups that represent those companies. “Toxic emissions are killing thousands of people across Europe every year, but rather than clamp down on polluters, politicians are allowing them to prioritise profit over public health. People in the UK could now end up paying with their health for our government’s sell-out to the coal lobby on a vital issue like air quality,” said Lawrence Carter, a campaigner for Greenpeace. Documents released to the group under the freedom of information act show that the companies helped to formulate Britain’s position, which was adopted and submitted to the European negotiations two years ago.     This is a classic case of the fox guarding the henhouse  Lawrence Carter, Greenpeace     Five out of the UK’s nine-strong delegation in Brussels work for companies that are responsible for large-scale emissions, including coal power plant operators RWE, EDF and E.ON. The remaining members of the British delegation are civil servants. The UK government maintains that industry representatives do not negotiate but the Guardian has learned that at key meetings in Brussels, they forcefully pushed for weaker pollution limits. Officials from energy firms repeatedly complained about the cost of clean air improvements, and a perceived lack of analysis of the economic consequences. They also lobbied to eliminate measures such as ‘coal washing’ from consideration, which would have reduced emissions of ash and sulphur dioxide. Other measures advanced by energy firms included weaker limits for nitrogen oxide emissions from gas plants, and using more polluting plants as the baseline for limits set under the new rules. A UK government spokesman told the Guardian: “It is absolutely right that the working group includes representatives from industry as they are well positioned to advise on these very technical and complex matters. It is also right that UK civil servants represent stakeholder interests, including industry, in Europe.” In all, more than 8,500 comments were submitted by EU states on the proposed new rules, a number the commission considers “exceptional”. The Guardian understands that the vast majority sought to weaken the proposed limits or introduce exemptions. “Operators of energy utilities shouldn’t sit in the official member states delegation to avoid obvious conflicts of interest in the setting of environmental performance benchmarks that they will themselves have to meet,” said Christian Schaible, a senior policy officer for the European Environment Bureau. In its report published on Thursday, Greenpeace accuses the delegations from Britain, Poland, Czech Republic, Greece, Germany, France and Spain of being the driving force behind the weakening of proposed controls. “Several of these countries are among the largest sources of coal-fired power plant pollution in Europe, causing significant health impacts and costs on their citizens and on the citizens of neighbouring countries,” the campaigners said. Greenpeace accuses nominally-independent members of European delegations of regularly promoting the interests of the polluters, “often using statements directly copied from industry representatives”. “This is a classic case of the fox guarding the henhouse,” Carter said. “By leaving the big polluters to write new air quality rules, EU and UK ministers are guilty of a collective dereliction of duty.” The industrial emissions directive rules were originally proposed in June 2013 and could still be amended in a formal proposal which the commission hopes to have ready by the end of the month. Across Europe, they would cut sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and particulate matter emissions by around 70%, 50% and 60% respectively. But an EU source confirmed to the Guardian that this would still be less robust than in other countries. “The US legislation was stronger than our [proposal]. They were quite a bit ahead of the EU, so Greenpeace are probably correct,” they said. “China had quite ambitious plans but putting them into reality is another story.”   Related: Air pollution will kill thousands in Europe, EEA warns    The new rules govern ‘best available techniques’ for curbing emissions under the directive, which is intended to prevent or reduce pollution. However, a clause in the directive allows rules to be implemented in an “economically viable and technically reliable” way. Some countries argue that the benefits of cleaner air are outweighed by the cost of technologies such as selective catalytic reduction, the most effective way of controlling nitrogen oxide emissions. Industry groups say that the top 20 energy utilities have already lost €500bn since 2008 because of EU clean energy targets. “Looking at the potentially high number of power plants which we will still have to close and the very limited scope for investing in this area, I think it is logical that industry should have expressed a strong interest in keeping their ability to supply much-needed balancing power alive,” said Hans ten Berge, the secretary-general of Eurelectric, which represents Europe’s electricity companies. On Tuesday, the European Environment Agency warned that air pollution will still cause hundreds of thousands of people to die prematurely in Europe in the next two decades because of governments’ failure to act.",2015-03-05T06:00:24Z,"Industry lobbyists weakened Europe's air pollution rules, say Greenpeace","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""3a7f5a1fa06599f6d8e9b8100b8ff6a962cd0068""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/5/1425546743921/149b4903-793f-4629-bd5c-6de31b4d9ad4-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Water vapour from power stations in Europe.

"Hundreds of thousands of Europeans will suffer a premature death in the next two decades as the result of governments’ failure to act on air pollution, Europe’s environmental watchdog has warned. In 2011, the latest year for which figures have been reliably collated, more than 400,000 are estimated to have died prematurely as a result of breathing toxic fumes, despite recent improvements in some countries The UK has been one of the worst offenders, with government figures showing that European Union regulations on air quality will not be met in cities including London, Birmingham and Leeds until 2030.       Europe is also faring badly on other environmental indicators, including the loss of biodiversity to intensive farming and urbanisation, and the poor state of many inland freshwater systems, according to the State of the Environment report for 2015, published by the European Environment Agency on Tuesday.  There have been some successes: coastal water pollution has been cleared up in many regions in the last two decades, as untreated sewage is no longer allowed to foul bathing beaches, and greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced overall. But the EEA warned that although on areas such as industrial pollution, air pollution and waste management the EU was showing good progress, the outlook for two decades from now was increasingly grim on all environmental fronts.  The agency rated key environmental indicators on a “traffic lights” system, rating them red, amber or green for how well they are being dealt with currently, and how that is likely to change in the next 20 years as current and prospective policies take a longer term effect. None of the 20 key indicators were rated as “green” in its 20 year-plus forecast. In its five-yearly report, the EEA also urged member state governments to take a more “joined-up” view of environmental issues. The study identified as a key problem the lack of coordination of regulation intended to address different aspects of environmental damage, such as water systems and biodiversity.  This can sometimes lead to trade-offs between good and bad effects. For instance, for more than a decade EU member states have tended to encourage the rise of diesel vehicles, with favourable tax regimes and pricing structures. This has been one factor in bringing down greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels used for road transport, as diesel engines are more fuel-efficient than their petrol counterparts. But it has had an unintended consequence in the form of greater air pollution, because diesel engines spew out more particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide than petrol-driven cars, giving rise to breathing difficulties in vulnerable people, such as children and older citizens. Hans Bruyninckx, executive director of the EEA, called for a “systemic” approach to protecting Europe’s environment. “It is not enough to look at these issues in isolation,” he told the Guardian. “They are interconnected and the way we study them and measure them and deal with them must be interconnected too.”   Related: Five things we've learned about the state of the UK's environment    Although member states are currently doing well on bringing down greenhouse gas emissions, this will be a problem in 20 years’ time, the report found. Ecosystems across the continent are in dire straits, with terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity rated as “red” based on current trends, and in the outlook for two decades hence. Land use and the health of the soil receive a similar “red” warning, as does the impact that climate change is likely to have on ecosystems. Bruyninckx said: “Our analysis shows that European policies have successfully tackled many environmental challenges over the years. But it also shows that we continue to harm the natural systems that sustain our prosperity. While living within planetary limits is an immense challenge, there are huge benefits in responding to it. Fully using Europe’s capacity to innovate could make us truly sustainable and put us at the frontier of science and technology, creating new industries and a healthier society.”",2015-03-03T05:01:07Z,"Air pollution will kill thousands in Europe, EEA warns","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""e4e5d42cc73d21b38648aa315dfb307f8713c057""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/2/1425312824545/270ebcf5-5526-4edb-9a2f-9e982394a69c-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""epa03553191 A signpost with a speed limit of 50 kph is seen in Brussels, Belgium, 24 January 2013.

"The federal and state governments have agreed to work together to improve air quality standards and help Australia adapt to the effects of climate change. After a meeting on Thursday, environment ministers released a discussion paper for a national clean air agreement proposing stronger air quality standards for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone, tackling the release of mercury into the environment and curbing shipping emissions. While the paper stressed that Australia’s air quality is “very good” compared with the rest of the world, the health costs of air pollution cost the country up to $24.3bn a year. Around 2.2% of hospital emissions for children aged under 14 with respiratory problems are due to PM10, a type of particulate released by burning fuels. There will also be a review of fuel quality standards and measures to control emissions from wood heaters and non-road spark ignition engines. The exact level of these standards has yet to be thrashed out by the governments. A climate change adaption working group has been established, to be chaired by Lisa Neville, Victoria’s environment minister. The group, which will involve all the states, will work on issues such as water management and renewable energy opportunities. The inclusion of sulphur dioxide (SO2) in the review has been welcomed by some residents in the Victorian town of Anglesea, who have fought a lengthy campaign against the Alcoa coal mine and power plant, which sits just 1km from a primary school. Surf Coast Air Action, a community environment group, claims that residents are at risk from the 39,000 tonnes of SO2 pumped out by the plant, citing evidence that it worsens asthma and contributes to heart and lung diseases. “It’s good news that slowly but surely it’s being recognised that current standards do not protect human health,” said Dr Jacinta Morahan, of the air action group. Morahan removed her own children from the school that sits next to the mine. “ I think [federal environment minister] Greg Hunt is to be commended for including SO2. It’s a real risk to people and there is community concern here about its impact, as well as the coal dust. At the moment, Alcoa can just say they are meeting the standards so nothing changes.” Federal Liberal MP Sarah Henderson, whose electorate includes Anglesea, told Guardian Australia she had lobbied Hunt to include the review of SO2. “My job is to be a strong advocate for the communities I represent and there’s no doubt there’s strong concern about Alcoa’s power plant,” said Henderson, who describes herself as a “strong environmentalist.”  “I’ve been very disappointed that Alcoa haven’t invested in sulphur dioxide scrubbers. “If we had our time again, the Anglesea coal fired power station would not be built where it is. Developing a coal mine in a pristine part of the world is not a decision governments would make these days.” Neville said there was “room for improvement” in air quality measures but that there needed to be a national agreement rather than the states going it alone. “We need a nationally consistent approach to provide certainty to everyone,” she told Guardian Australia. Neville said while many of the states disagreed with the federal government on its climate change policies, the election of a new Labor government in Queensland provides “whole new options on what we can be doing together to tackle climate change.” Other matters discussed include the phasing out of microplastics that harm the marine environment and also the banning of non-biodegradable plastic bags. New South Wales has already committed to reducing microplastics use as well as to establish a deposit scheme by July 2017 for the recycling of beer bottles and other containers. “The banning of only lightweight bags may not be effective in reducing the total volume of plastic bags washing into our oceans, rivers and waterways,” said NSW environment minister Rob Stokes. “An effective approach must also be to reduce heavy plastic bags. It must not drive up consumption of so-called degradable bags, that instead break down into small pieces and become micro-plastics in the food chain rather than completely degrading.” Hunt said there had been “remarkable cooperation” between the federal government and the states and territories to implement the national clean air agreement by July 2016. “Australian cities have very good air quality by world standards but it could be better, and over the coming decades as population grows, we need to make sure that our air quality improves, that we reduce particulates, reduce sulphur dioxide,” he said.",2015-02-27T06:35:07Z,State and federal governments agree to crack down on air pollution,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-e4c5a76f-e13a-4594-95ae-c99627cfea15""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/27/1425018662494/c954ed9f-99d8-4e9f-9b97-e087f8d59f1d-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Fossil fuel power station"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Pressure groups say sulphur dioxide released by power stations worsens asthma and contributes to heart and lung disease.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Jochen Tack /Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>",35,Tougher standards on emissions and a national clean air agreement could help reduce healthcare costs by billions of dollars,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/27/1425018662772/3932c419-776d-4f90-8bb4-a682953d065c-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/feb/27/state-and-federal-governments-agree-crackdown-on-air-pollution,0,positive
"Boris Johnson’s plan for an “ultra low emission zone” (ULEZ) to reduce London’s air pollution from dirty vehicles should not be delayed for five years and must be widened to cover a much larger area of the capital, the London assembly has told the mayor. The zone, which Transport for London (TfL) hopes will enable the city to avoid heavy fines from Europe and cut the number of premature deaths from air pollution each year, will not ban traffic but will charge the owners of polluting vehicles up to £100 a day if they drive into most of central London.   Related: Mayor's failure to clean up London's air pollution 'risks children's health'    With air pollution in London now estimated to be causing the early deaths of over four thousand people a year, the environment committee of the London assembly in its official response to a consultation on the zone argued that waiting until 2020 to introduce the ULEZ would be inexcusable. Liberal Democrat and Green party assembly members said it should be brought in by 2018 or earlier. But Conservative party assembly members dissociated themselves from the response.  “We are particularly concerned about the report’s recommendations to bring forward the ULEZ to 2018, to increase the daily charge for vehicles and to further tighten the standards. We do not feel that there would be sufficient benefit in going beyond the current proposals, to justify the additional restrictions and costs to vehicle owners, or the impact on London’s economy that these measures are likely to bring,” said the Conservatives. In a move guaranteed to personally embarrass the mayor, the environment committee also urged TfL not to exempt London’s flagship new routemaster buses from the zone, which Johnson pledged to introduce when he was first elected in 2008 and which first came into service in 2012. These diesel hybrid buses are expected to be much more polluting than all other London buses by 2020, and should be retrofitted to meet new standards or be banned from the city centre, said the assembly members. A spokeswoman for the mayor of London rejected the idea of bringing the zone in earlier: “It would be unreasonable to bring something like the Ultra Low Emission Zone in without fair warning, and before cleaner (Euro 6) vehicles are widely available, giving drivers, and businesses time to prepare for the change.” She added: “Improving London’s air quality is an urgent challenge which affects the health and well-being of every Londoner, and is something the Mayor takes extremely seriously. His world first Ultra Low Emission Zone is at the heart of the most radical package of measures happening anywhere on the planet to address the issue.” The committee said in its response: “Levels of NO2 [nitrogen dioxide] are seriously in breach of UK and EU law and are responsible for thousands of early deaths each year in London, as well as other serious health problems. Organisations including London boroughs, the London Health Commission, and the Faculty of Public Health of the Royal Colleges of Physicians have all called for the ULEZ to be strengthened with earlier implementation, wider coverage, stricter standards and stronger incentives.”. “Financial costs to a fraction of drivers must be weighed against the health benefits to those same drivers, plus a much larger population of others, who are exposed to air pollution in central London and beyond,” said the assembly members.",2015-02-11T06:01:04Z,"Boris Johnson advised his London air pollution plans are too little, too late","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""9937faa00d7ac49f980c8099746dd5af584407df""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/10/1423590165340/a7e52206-8e05-40d2-a435-e94ad74ba376-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Mayor of London Boris Johnson poses with artists impressions of the design for London's new Routemaster bus on May 17, 2010 in London,."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Mayor of London Boris Johnson poses with artists impressions of the design for London’s new Routemaster bus in 2010.

"London mayor Boris Johnson is risking children’s health by blocking action to clean up London’s poor air quality, the city’s former deputy mayor has claimed. Nicky Gavron said the mayor had failed to deliver on his promise of an electric car ‘revolution’ and is not cleaning up buses quickly enough. London has been in breach of EU pollution limits since 2010, and is not expected to reach safe levels for another 15 years, despite the threat of fines from the EU.  “Until we have political leadership that takes this issue seriously we must face the reality that London’s children will continue to be exposed to levels of pollution that will scar their health for the rest of their lives,” Gavron, who was deputy mayor under Ken Livingston, writes in The Guardian. New research shows the capital’s air is now so dangerous in some places that the idea of what constitutes a safe route to school for children should be reconsidered to avoid the most polluted roads, she said. Vehicles, in particular diesel exhausts, are the main source of tiny particulate pollution linked to serious health problems, as well as thousands of premature deaths in London annually. Johnson was forced to defend his record on tackling air pollution last year, after a presentation by air quality experts at King’s College said they believed Oxford Street had the highest NO2 levels in the world.   Gavron said that while Johnson is introducing an ‘ultra low emissions zone’ (ULEZ), its 2020 start date is too late and the scheme will exempt some of the most polluting vehicles. The new “Boris buses”, which have been billed as clean, green vehicles, will fail to meet the new zone’s emissions limit and require special permission to enter toll-free, Gavron said. “There is a real move for radical reform and it is only Boris Johnson’s intransigence which is holding change back,” she said. “Unfortunately, this mayor has fallen asleep at the wheel.” Matthew Pencharz, the mayor’s environment adviser, rejected the charges. “This predictable attempt to discredit the mayor is way off the mark. The truth is that the mayor is investing hundreds of millions of pounds on the most ambitious package of measures to improve air quality in the world. Thanks to his actions we now meet the legal limits for eight out of the nine EU regulated pollutants and the number of Londoners living in areas above nitrogen dioxide limits has been halved since 2008.”  The mayor’s office defended the new Routemaster buses and their use inside the proposed ULEZ, saying no other diesel-electric bus “comes close” to it in terms of NO2 emissions. Over a thousand of London’s oldest buses had been retrofitted to cut their NO2 emissions, his office said. The ULEZ will apply to the same area as the current congestion charge zone, with drivers of petrol cars older than those meeting Euro 4 standards and Euro 6 for diesel cars needing to pay £12.50 in addition to the congestion charge. Unlike the congestion charge, the ULEZ would be in effect all week round, according to a public consultation which closes on Friday. On the week that most children go back to school, Gavron argues that safe routes to the 1,148 schools that are within 150 metres of pollution hotspots should be reconsidered to avoid roads with the worst pollution levels, in particular in east London. The Mayor’s office has previously said that pupils should be kept indoors during playtime at times of high pollution. The former deputy mayor highlights comments by Jonathan Grigg, professor of paediatric respiratory and environmental medicine at Queen Mary University, who said: “by the time anything happens [action on pollution] their [children’s] lungs will have been damaged and they will not have obtained their maximum growth potential. In 10 years they will have suffered all the effects we now see coming through increased vulnerability to a range of respiratory disorders in childhood and goodness knows what that leads to in terms of vulnerability to disease in later life.”  Gavron urges an urgent strategy to tackle the problem, “including lower speed limits, measures to reduce congestion and idling and an ultra low emission zone for the whole of London”.",2015-01-08T14:00:10Z,Mayor's failure to clean up London's air pollution 'risks children's health',"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""26b039b7a50d9666397ccce630490a10f0b5fd4f""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/8/1420717097875/7b1310e6-3fab-4696-af9f-363178efea9c-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""A photo taken on April 2, 2014 shows air pollution hanging in the air and lowering visibility in London."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">London has been in breach of EU pollution limits since 2010, and is not expected to reach safety levels for another 15 years.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",37,"Boris Johnson risks lifelong damage to the health of London’s children by blocking action to clean up the capital’s dangerous air pollution, says former deputy mayor Nicky Gavron",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/8/1420717099536/7b1310e6-3fab-4696-af9f-363178efea9c-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/08/mayors-failure-clean-up-londons-air-pollution-risks-childrens-health,4,negative
"In the 14 years I have been representing Londoners at City Hall, the problem of air pollution has rarely been off the top of the political agenda. Of all the environmental challenges the capital currently faces, air pollution is by far the most deadly. In the year 2000, when city government was restored, we knew that exposure to air pollution was associated with serious health conditions like asthma. Fourteen years and a great deal of scientific research later, we now know that diesel exhaust fumes are carcinogenic, and that air pollution has a direct causal link with respiratory diseases and is responsible for the premature deaths of 7,500 Londoners every year. That is not far behind smoking, which is responsible for 8,400 premature deaths in the capital. The impact of traffic-related pollution on children’s health is truly alarming and has been known about for some time. Research led by King’s College London has shown that vehicle pollution stunts lung growth in children.  Now new research is showing that exposure from even the half-hour daily walk to and from school is detrimental. This is the subject of an on-going study on the impact of traffic-related pollution on respiratory function in children living in east London.  Research lead Jonathan Grigg, professor of paediatric respiratory and environmental medicine at Queen Mary, has complained that “there is a tremendous [political] inertia which frustrates me enormously; by the time anything happens their lungs will have been damaged and they will not have obtained their maximum growth potential. In 10 years they will have suffered all the effects we now see coming through increased vulnerability to a range of respiratory disorders in childhood and goodness knows what that leads to in terms of vulnerability to disease in later life.” This should be a clarion call to those in power. The failure so far to come up with a suitable, co-ordinated response to all the evidence is frankly lamentable. We can no longer afford for this to fall on deaf ears. Yet this government is moving backwards. Shockingly, shortly before Christmas, Defra announced proposals that would result in the scrapping of thousands of air pollution monitoring sites that are crucial in aiding our understanding about the true extent of air pollution. This is being proposed even in the face of a further ruling from the EU, which could see the UK supreme court forcing the government to meet air pollution limits earlier than planned.  In November 2014, following two previous reports that were ignored, parliament’s environmental audit committee published its third report on air quality in five years. Quite rightly this focuses on the practical measures that the government must take to protect the most vulnerable. This includes banning the building of new schools near air pollution hotspots.  I agree that we need sensible planning policies, but what about the 1,148 London schools that already exist within 150m of roads carrying 10,000 vehicles a day? As deputy mayor in the first mayoral administration, I championed the Safe Routes to Schools programme, which worked with parents, teachers and pupils to identify the safest paths and streets to walk down and any measures needed to improve them. However, Prof Grigg’s research gives new meaning to “safe” routes to school. Routes must now be reconfigured to avoid the most congested and therefore polluted main roads, accompanied of course by initiatives to reduce pollution in the first place. Until all vehicles run on clean fuel and streets are more pedestrian friendly, we urgently need a transitional strategy, including lower speed limits, measures to reduce congestion and idling and an ultra low emission zone for the whole of London. Unfortunately, this mayor has fallen asleep at the wheel. The promise to make London the electric car capital of Europe never came to fruition. The progress made on retro-fitting London’s polluting bus fleet has been painfully slow. Mayor Livingstone introduced a radical London-wide low emission zone in 2008, but the implementation phases have been delayed or completely abandoned by mayor Johnson. He now points to his ‘ultra’ low emission zone, but this won’t start until 2020 and will still allow the most polluting vehicles to enter for payment of a small fee and exempts some of the worst polluters like buses. Ironically, many of the mayor’s prized “Boris buses” will not meet his own emission standards and will be given special permission to enter toll free and pollute as usual. The zone itself will only cover the inner ring road congestion charge area and leave Londoners outside of the zone exposed to dangerous levels of emissions for decades to come. The mayor always said tackling air pollution is a team effort, yet he has flatly refused the requests from councils in London lobbying to be part of the new zone. There is a real move for radical reform and it is only Boris Johnson’s intransigence which is holding change back. Until we have political leadership that takes this issue seriously we must face the reality that London’s children will continue to be exposed to levels of pollution that will scar their health for the rest of their lives.",2015-01-08T14:00:10Z,Air pollution will scar health of London's children,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""f3658084b430d92adb5cb662549c833afc6f88ce""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/8/1420717258794/fd568482-9647-4c8f-93c5-4c5f302d78cd-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Dust particles and pollution from cars hangs over London, seen from Greenwich, as people suffering the effects of high levels of pollution - including sore eyes, coughs and sore throats - should cut down the amount of activity they take outside, experts have warned on April 2, 2014."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">‘Of all the environmental challenges the capital currently faces, air pollution is by far the most deadly.’</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>",38,"<strong>Nicky Gavron: </strong>Vehicle pollution stunts lung growth in children and causes a range of respiratory disorders, but Boris Johnson has turned a blind eye to the capital’s most serious challenge ",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/7/1420646978955/20f697e7-f3ed-47ef-95b2-4254c9a7cbe2-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/08/air-pollution-will-scar-londons-children-for-rest-their-lives,4,negative
"China’s largest coal-fired power plant has been violating national emission standards for chemicals that cause dangerous fine particulate matter pollution, official figures show. The Waigaoqiao coal-fired power plant located in Shanghai has been violating China’s national standards for nitrogen oxides every week since new standards came into force in July, according to analysis of publicly available government data by researchers at Greenpeace East Asia. The data shows that phase two of the Waigaoqiao plant, which has a capacity of 1,800MW, has been emitting nitrogen oxides in excess of emission standards used by the local environmental protection bureau 18% of the time.  Research by Greenpeace also shows that the local regulator is not yet using the national standards on nitrogen oxides. If the new standards were being used, the group said the plant would be in violation almost all of the time. Waigaoqiao is often praised as the cleanest coal-powered plant in China and is seen as a showcase for other plants in the country. However such a large violation of emissions standards at this plant shows that China is still struggling with enforcing its environmental protection laws and regulations. “The gap in enforcement is still there,” said Ma Jun, the director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs in Beijing, which also monitors pollution levels throughout China. The case shows that even in the well-developed coastal regions of China “there is still an enforcement gap, but the gap is bigger in the mid and western parts of China,” he said.  Lauri Myllyvirta, a senior global coal campaigner with Greenpeace, said: “the systematic violations, in a mega power plant in the middle of China’s most important economic centre and the failure by the regulator to effectively intervene illustrate the challenge that China faces in controlling emissions from its massive coal industry”.     Heavy smog shrouds the Pudong Lujiazui financial district in Shanghai, China.  Photograph: ChinaFotoPress/Getty Images    Greenpeace also looked at figures for the neighbouring province of Jiangsu and found that in July, half of the coal-fired plants were violating the regulations on nitrogen oxides. “This is not a single case but maybe in the whole country the power plants have the same problem,” said Fang Lifeng, a coal expert with Greenpeace, based in Beijing. Nitrogen oxides are one of the main contributors to fine particulate pollution known as PM2.5 which is considered dangerous because it penetrates deep into the lungs. PM2.5 pollution was linked to 670,000 premature deaths in 2012, according to a study released in November.  While China has made progress in dealing with other components of air pollution including sulphur dioxide, it has only recently started to deal with the issue of nitrogen oxides. China is still facing many issues in terms of enforcement of its environmental regulations but there has been a lot of progress made on transparency of data and it is now publishing real-time data from a huge number of power and industrial plants. “With this I think China has made some remarkable progress and we need to recognise that. The real-time disclosure of the online monitoring data on such a massive scale, China is probably the first country to do that,” said Ma Jun. “It demonstrates that in China there has been some real political will to try to deal with the problems.”",2014-12-18T05:00:01Z,China's largest coal power plant violating air pollution levels every week,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""fca79f9d9c3c80a91c63c3dcb5928d0d30abbf61""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/17/1418822289213/98b8ddc1-68ba-4b9f-8571-47f4edfc23c7-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Smoke is seen emitted from chimneys at the Waigaoqiao coal-fired power plant in Pudong, Shanghai, China, 3 December 2008."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The Waigaoqiao coal-fired power plant in Pudong, Shanghai, China.

"Thanks to European judges, the UK government may be taking a closer interest in Boris Johnson’s strategy for cleaning London’s air. A case won in the European Court of Justice (ECJ) by environmental group Client Earth has increased the legal pressure for Britain’s big cities to bring down the levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) spewed in them by diesel engines and inhaled in them by human beings. The capital is a serious NO2 offender. It needs to do more if both the city and the nation are to be brought into line.  At a recent air quality conference organised by London Councils and the City of London Corporation, the seriousness and costs of air pollution in all its forms were laid out with alarming clarity. Dr Gary Fuller of King’s College, who monitors the stuff, said NO2 exceeds EU limits by “factors of between two and three” in some London locations, including far from central hotspots, such as next to Brixton tube station and on Putney High Street.  Those EU limits were set in 1998 and were meant to have been met four years ago. Current forecasts suggest London won’t get there until after 2030 unless serious action is taken. Better progress has been made against particulate matter - smoke, dust, dirt and chemicals substantially caused by motor vehicles - but we’re still far short of what the World Health Organisation wants to see. What Fuller called the “health burden” is heavy. The mayor agrees, accepting the findings of a report he commissioned which estimated that 4,300 Londoners died prematurely as a result of air pollution in 2008 alone. Bad air in the lungs is linked to bronchitis, asthma, strokes, cancer and, top of the list, heart disease. Dr Iarla Kilbane-Dawe described how particulates (PM) coat the lungs and lodge in the heart and brain. He suggested two quick air pollution remedies: one, switching from diesel to clean fuel (he stressed that petrol qualifies); two, reducing vehicle speeds and weights. “It’s not just soot from exhausts that drives the PM,” he said, “it’s also friction - abrasion of road surfaces.”  Not all London’s air quality problems come from motor vehicles, but the difference made by removing them from streets can be dramatic. Kilbane-Dawe showed an image from a piece of King’s College research illustrating the huge enhancement in air quality in Regent Street on a pre-Christmas day when it was closed to traffic compared with adjoining Oxford Street at the same time.  All this makes Johnson’s air quality approach look weak. Rather than slowing vehicle speeds, he’s sought to increase them. As a gift to motorists, he’s halved the size of the congestion charging zone. His proposed ultra low emission zone (ULEZ) is predicted to take London two thirds of the distance it must travel to meet EU NO2 requirements, but it won’t even start to come into effect until 2020. At his monthly question time on Wednesday, shortly after the ECJ decision came through, the mayor defended his record. “We’re in the lead, we’re doing lots of stuff, we’re taking huge amounts of flack from drivers to make vehicles cleaner,” he said. He has a case. There are more hybrid buses, albeit fewer so far than originally planned, and old ones have had a greening retrofit. Some steps have been taken to clean up the taxi fleet. Johnson has encouraged cycling, which partly mitigates his generally bad decisions over roads. If the ULEZ is too little, too late, it is more than the national government has achieved, a point that’s been made by none other than the lawyer who conducted Client Earth’s legal challenge.  Johnson has also had some unfair press coverage, a novel experience for a politician most of the media adore. He was right to dismiss as “bollocks” reports that Oxford Street is the most polluted in the world, a story that began with the misrepresentation of some of King’s College’s work. It’s true that London isn’t the world’s worst for air quality. It’s also true that it’s improved. The problem is that it isn’t improving enough or fast enough. Client Earth’s Euro court win, together with the EU’s own action against the UK, should concentrate reluctant minds a little more. Johnson complained on Wednesday that if London received the lion’s share of government funds for ultra low emission vehicles “we could spend it far better than any other place in Britain”. He and his pals up river have a clear common interest in tackling London’s air pollution problem speedily. It’s time they got together and put their foot down.

"  Britain has 10 of Europe’s top 50 “super-polluting” power stations and factories, helping to cost it more in health and environmental impacts than any other countries, except for Germany and Poland.   New air pollution figures from the European environment agency (EEA) suggest that a handful of power stations and industrial plants together cost the National Health Service and the wider UK economy over £10bn a year.   Of over 14,000 major industrial plants identified in Europe’s 27 countries, Drax power station in Selby and the Longannet plant at Kincardine in Scotland were ranked respectively 5th and 10th between 2008-2012.  Drax’s air pollution is calculated to have cost the economy £2.7-£6.34bn and Longannet £1.8-4.56bn. The Corus steel works in Redcar ranked 27th in Europe with Alcan Aluminium in Co Durham 34th. The 10 biggest British plants together were calculated to have at cost at least £12.6bn in air pollution damages between 2008-2012.   Eight of the 30 biggest sources of air pollution were in Germany, six in Poland, four in Romania and three each in Bulgaria and the Britain. Half of all the health and environmental costs were said to be caused by just 1% of the industrial plants, said the report.         The authors calculated the economic damage done not just by major air pollutants emitted from coal and gas power stations but also those from burning diesel and petrol in vehicles. It included the estimated cost to the health service of the premature deaths and respiratory problems caused by traffic and industry, as well as the damage done to buildings, and the money lost from crop damage and from soil and water pollution.  CO2, a major gas responsible for climate change, was costed according to its carbon price. For the air pollutants, the majority of costs were said to be due to the health impacts of people breathing in minute particles of unburned carbon.   According to the authors, “air pollution cost [European] society at least €59 billion, (£46bn) and possibly as much as €189 billion (£149bn) in 2012. The upper estimate is roughly the same as the GDP of Finland or half the GDP of Poland. In Britain, the cost is estimated to be between £31-99bn in the five years from 2008.”   “While we all benefit from industry and power generation, this analysis shows that the technologies used by these plants impose hidden costs on our health and the environment. Industry is also only part of the picture – it is important to recognise that other sectors, primarily transport and agriculture, also contribute to poor air quality,” said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA director.   The report recorded a small decrease in the economic damage done over the five years monitored in the report. This, said the authors, reflected lower emissions from European industry, attributed to both tighter air pollution laws, greater efficiency in factories and machines and the Europe-wide economic recession.   But the EEA warned that the total cost of damage to health and the environment from pollution by all sectors of the economy, including from ‘diffuse’ sources such as road transport and households, could be significantly higher.  In 2010, the European commission estimated that the external costs associated with only the main air pollutants ranged from £260- 740bn.  An EEA spokesman added that because air pollution crossed borders, all figures were calculated from sources of pollution. The wide range of damages, he said, reflected different countries’ ways of putting a value on the health impacts of air pollution as well as the different methods used to estimate CO2 related damage.

"The mayor of London’s view on Oxford Street’s air pollution has not changed, contrary to your report (Mayor chokes on own tweet over Oxford Street air, 14 November). The claim that it is the most polluted street in the world was erroneous and the mayor does not accept it. Letters between the mayor and Joan Walley MP have been taken completely out of context. He has never disputed the King’s College data, but has always been clear that this data was taken out of context and misrepresented repeatedly by the media. King’s College agrees that its data was misrepresented and reiterated this point to the London assembly’s environment committee just last week. London has considerably lower levels of pollution than many world cities, as any reasonable analysis of international air quality shows, and Boris Johnson takes the problem extremely seriously. He is driving the most comprehensive and ambitious set of measures in the world to improve air quality, including tightening standards for buses, taxis and large vehicles and a new ultra-low-emission zone for central London, which includes Oxford Street and the surrounding roads from 2020.Matthew PencharzMayor’s senior adviser for environment and energy",2014-11-20T06:08:07Z,London air pollution isn’t the world’s worst,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""ce259a10dd9877bbaf47fd827c8efa1ed42b1b93""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/19/1416413565894/Oxford-Circus-pollution-011.jpg"" alt=""Oxford Circus, pollution"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">'The mayor has never disputed the King’s College data, but this data was taken out of context.'

"The government will be forced to urgently clean up illegal air pollution in British cities following a ruling on Wednesday in the European court of justice. It is likely to see many diesel cars and heavy goods vehicles restricted from city centres within a few years. The landmark case, brought by a small environmental group through the UK courts, will allow people to sue the government for breaching EU pollution laws and will force ministers to prepare plans for many cities to improve air quality.  Europe’s highest court firmly rejected Britain’s long-standing approach to complying with EU air pollution laws which has been to appeal to Europe for time extensions.  The government has admitted that under its current plans, London, Leeds and Birmingham will not meet legal limits for the toxic nitrogen dioxide gas (NO2) until after 2030. This is 20 years after the original deadline set by Europe. Other cities, including Manchester and Glasgow , have target dates of 2025. Instead, national courts in Europe will now be able to order governments to produce plans which achieve NO2 limits in a period of time as “short as possible”. The UK Supreme court is expected to interpret what the time frame should be next year.  “Thousands of people die because of air pollution in Britain every year. This ruling will save lives by forcing the government to finally take this issue seriously. They will now have to come up with an urgent plan to rid our towns and cities of cancer-causing diesel fumes,” said Alan Andrews, lawyer with Client Earth which brought the case.  “This sets a groundbreaking legal precedent in EU law and paves the way for a series of legal challenges across Europe,” he said. Cities across Europe may have little choice now but to introduce “ultra low emission zones” such as the one planned for London in 2020, said Simon Birkett, director of Clean Air London. “Diesel exhaust must be banned from the most polluted places just as coal was 60 years ago.” Maria Eagle MP, the shadow environment secretary, said: “This European Court of Justice judgement is a damning indictment of the government’s total failure to tackle the UK’s air pollution. Air pollution is a serious public health issue facing our towns and cities, tens of thousands of lives are lost each year and yet David Cameron’s government has done nothing to solve the problem. The European Court of Justice has now demanded that the UK take urgent action to address dangerous levels of air pollution”. The UK government, which cannot appeal against the European judgment, responded by saying: “Roadside concentrations of NO2 levels have fallen 15% since 2010. We have built on this by committing £2bn since 2011 to increase the uptake of ultra-low emission vehicles, green transport initiatives and supporting local authorities to take action. “We are revising our plans to reflect recent action so we can be compliant as soon as possible. This is a common challenge across Europe with 17 member states exceeding limits. This judgment confirms where limit values are exceeded, plans must be developed which ensure compliance in the shortest possible time,” said a Defra spokeswoman.  Joan Walley, chair of the Environmental audit committee of MPs which quizzed London mayor Boris Johnson on air pollution in September, said: “Today’s ruling from the European court is a welcome intervention, because it will force the government to prioritise the issue of air quality in all decisions on transport policy and infrastructure.”  Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder said: “Today’s ruling shows we need a radical new approach to tackling air pollution in Europe. On their own, local authorities will always find it difficult to comply with these limits as air pollution moves around Europe and does not respect national or regional boundaries.” Friends of the Earth called on government to roll out low-emission and congestion charging zones, scrap road-building plans, and make it easier for people to cycle and walk.  “UK air quality is a national disgrace – tough measures are long overdue. This ruling should force the government to take the urgent steps needed to clean up Britain’s filthy air, and help prevent many of the tens of thousands of premature deaths every year caused by air pollution,” said a spokeswoman. The case was referred to European courts after the UK Supreme court ruled earlier this year that the government was failing in its legal duty to protect people from the harmful effects of air pollution. It followed evidence that showed that NO2 pollution legal limits were exceeded in 40 of the the UK’s 43 urban zones in 2010.  Britain submitted plans to the European Commission to postpone the deadline for 24 of the zones but it did not request time extensions for 16.  Separately, the European environment agency said on Wednesday that almost all European city dwellers are exposed to pollutants at levels deemed unsafe by the World Health Organization (WHO).  “For some pollutants, more than 95 % of the urban population is exposed to unsafe levels. Most … have declined slightly over the last decade but NO2 has not fallen as fast as expected. This is partly because vehicles are an important source of NO2, and emission standards have not always led to the anticipated reductions,” it said in its annual air quality report.

"They banned the burning of funeral offerings, closed restaurants and factories, halted deliveries and took millions of cars off the roads. But Chinese leaders were unable to achieve blue skies for this week’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) meeting in Beijing, with data from the US embassy showing air pollution at six times the World Health Organisation’s safe daily limit. The one course of action left to officials? Denying access to the US data. As global leaders tucked into their welcoming dinner, the US reading – still available on the embassy’s own website – was “very unhealthy”, with an air quality index reading of 203. It showed the concentration of PM2.5, the smallest particulate matter, at 153 micrograms per cubic metre. The WHO says the safe daily level is 25 micrograms. But as the Washington Post reported, Smartphone apps and Chinese websites that normally included the US figures alongside official statistics, had the former removed, while the official Chinese feed crept up to 147 or “lightly polluted”. An app that normally carries the US data showed steadily rising levels in the morning before switching abruptly at lunchtime to an implausible “0: excellent” reading. On the beijing-air site a notice wished the Apec summit every success and read: “On the instructions of authorities, for this month’s air quality data, please refer to figures from the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau”. Chinese officials argue that the US measure cannot be regarded as accurate because it is based on a reading from a single spot in Beijing. Even the 203 measure is unremarkable by the capital’s standards. October saw unusually noxious levels of pollution, with many people blaming increased production by factories which knew they would have to shut before Apec. Runners in the Beijing marathon participated in facemasks as the US embassy PM2.5 reading reached 344 micrograms per cubic metre. The vice-premier, Zhang Gaoli, recently said that ensuring the air was clean for Apec was the “priority of priorities”. Among residents, “Apec blue” has become slang for something enjoyable but short-lived or unreal.

"Local governments in China have submitted plans to relocate or upgrade almost 1,000 chemical plants in the wake of the massive explosions in Tianjin earlier this month that killed 147 people. The blast at a warehouse storing toxic chemicals was China’s worst industrial accident in recent years. There has been criticism it was located too close to densely populated residential areas.  China’s industry minister, Miao Wei, said local governments were finally moving ahead to implement plans to relocate and upgrade chemical plants. “We started to work with State Administration of Work Safety last year to make arrangements for the relocation and revamping of chemical plants in densely populated urban areas. Frankly, our work is not actively supported locally in the past year,” Miao was quoted by the Communist party-run People’s Daily newspaper. According to the department’s summary, about 1,000 chemical plants need to be relocated or upgraded at a total cost of around 400bn yuan (£40.6bn).  Miao said local government and the companies involved would have to take care of part of the cost while central government would provide support. He said he wanted to “accelerate the relocation and revamping”, which would help to improve pollution and emission levels. Two explosions ripped though a warehouse at the port city of Tianjin on 12 August. Authorities have said up to 40 types of chemicals were being stored at the warehouse including large quantities of sodium cyanide. According to government regulations, such facilities should not be located closer than 1km (0.6 miles) from public places, transport networks or residential areas. There were also claims that at least two other companies who handled flammable and toxic chemicals were operating in the same area and that their facilities were less than a mile away from a school and a residential area. The death toll from the accident has risen to 147, according to Chinese state media. The cleanup operation at the site is continuing. Photos carried by the state news agency Xinhua showed cranes and diggers moving piles of burnt-out debris and shipping containers.  Meanwhile an amendment to China’s air pollution law has been adopted in an attempt to clean up the country’s toxic air pollution. The amendment, passed by the standing committee of the National People’s Congress, requires that a standard for gasoline quality is established. While China has a standard for sulphur content in petrol, the permitted levels of other chemicals such as benzene in diesel are much higher than European standards. Local governments will also be required to ban the use of low-quality coal in homes. The law also provides for greater environmental transparency and stipulates that air pollution following environmental emergencies such as the disaster at Tianjin should be monitored and the details made public.

"The government is urging people to reduce their physical activities, particularly outdoors, after pollution levels across much of England and Wales peaked because of a combination of fireworks night and unusually still weather.  Pollution levels across the north and south-west of England, the Midlands, and south Wales are now “very high” meaning that the official health advice now urges people with lung problems, heart problems, and older people, to avoid strenuous physical activity, while people with asthma are told they may need to use their reliever inhaler more often. According to the advice the general population should: “Reduce physical exertion, particularly outdoors, especially if you experience symptoms such as cough or sore throat.” Readings from the government’s monitoring network show pollution at 10 out of 10 on the Daily Air Quality Index rankings, across the country. During the Sahara dust smog episode in April, pollution was at similar levels across the south-east and London. Pollution levels peak annually after particulate pollution from bonfires and fireworks and often fall rapidly as they are dispersed by the wind.  Fog and still weather has led to this morning’s warnings, but the environment department’s UK Air unit said the very high pollution would clear and return to low throughout the day. Data from 9am shows very high levels for the whole of England and Wales except for the south-east where levels are moderate, and East Anglia and north Wales, where they are low.

"Air pollution in India has become so severe that yields of crops are being cut by almost half, scientists have found. Researchers analysed yields for wheat and rice alongside pollution data, and concluded significant decreases in yield could be attributed to two air pollutants, black carbon and ground level ozone. The finding has implications for global food security as India is a major rice exporter. Black carbon is mostly caused by rural cookstoves, and ozone forms as a result of motor vehicle exhaust, industrial emissions, and chemical solvents reacting in the atmosphere in the presence of sunlight. Both are “short-lived climate pollutants” that exist locally in the atmosphere for weeks to months, with ozone damaging plants’ leaves and black carbon reducing the amount of sunlight they receive. The study looked at both the effects of climate change and the two pollutants on crop yields.  “While temperature’s gone up in the last three decades, the levels of smog and pollution have changed much more dramatically,” says Jennifer Burney, an environmental scientist at University of California, San Diego, and co-author of the paper, published in the journal PNAS. “But this was the first time anyone looked at historical data to show that these pollutants are having tremendous impacts on crops.” Comparing crop yields in 2010 to what they would be expected to be if temperature, rainfall and pollution remained at their 1980 levels, the researchers showed that crop yields for wheat were on average 36%lower than they otherwise would have been, while rice production decreased by up to 20%. In some higher population states, wheat yields were as much as 50% lower.  Using modelling to account for the effects of temperature increase and precipitation changes in that time, they were able to show that 90% of this loss is attributable to the impact of the two pollutants.  The results are specific to India’s seasonal patterns, the crops, and its high pollution levels, but may extend to other places with similar problems, such as China. Chinese scientists warned in February that severe air pollution is slowing photosynthesis in plants, with effects “somewhat similar to a nuclear winter”. Previous studies had used experimental data looking at the impacts of ozone on plants to extrapolate potential losses, but this is the first ever study to use actual historical agricultural and emissions data to account for lower crop yields. “Overall I think it’s a great paper,” says Stanford agricultural ecologist David Lobell. “I think in both India and China there is growing recognition of the toll that poor air quality has on agriculture. This study will certainly add to that recognition.” Lobell and Burney both point out that because black carbon and ozone are short-lived pollutants, they present a clear opportunity for tackling climate change. While long-lived greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide can persist in the atmosphere for decades to centuries, addressing sources of the short-lived pollutants will have more immediately perceptible effects. Measures such as improved cookstove technology for rural areas, or cleaner coal consumption and diesel filters on trucks in urban ones, could go a long way to improving the impacts on agricultural yields. “Our thought is that these are more politically tractable points of entry for making meaningful change in climate,” says Burney. “There’s a really local benefit for taking on some sort of costly action.” Burney also points out that because of India’s key role in exporting rice, such efforts could play a critical role in helping global food security.",2014-11-03T20:00:02Z,India air pollution 'cutting crop yields by almost half',"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""1f2cd28897485b35d58b583ebc7e9e32db153825""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/3/1415026190299/7fdff646-7aed-47d8-9df4-a42eceff2a2f-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Smog cover India Gate, Delhi "" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The iconic India Gate in Delhi, shrouded in smog, is barely visible.

"You can’t see the old Chingola copper mine, with its smelter and refinery, from the village of Shimulala. It’s miles away, beyond 300ft-high hills of waste tailings, the leach plant, the main pollution control dam and the 1,600ft-deep open pit that is one of Africa’s largest holes. But you can smell and taste the pollution from the biggest copper mine in Africa. If you pump a glass of water from the borehole outside the little church in Shimulala, you will see it is bright yellow, smells of sulphur and tastes vile.   Related: Zambian villagers take mining giant Vedanta to court in UK over toxic leaks    Mining giant Vedanta’s subsidiary company KCM drilled the borehole in 2010 for the village after the Mushishima stream was turned into a river of acid when mining chemicals spilled into it. But a leaked company letter says that chemists who tested borehole water there in 2011 found it tainted with copper residues, acid and minerals, and said it was unfit for consumption. Now the villagers must use the stream too. 1,800 people from Shimulala, Hippo Pool, Hellen and Kakosa villages took their complaints to the high court in London in a case that could last years and make giant mining companies working in developing countries address local pollution more seriously.    We ate the fish and soon everyone started crying with stomach pains. I collapsed and was taken to a hospital  Floribert Kappa, resident, Hippo Pool village     The villagers say acid spills and contaminated water in their streams, rivers and boreholes are getting worse. “The frequency and severity of spills is higher and more consistent. Before we could not smell [the pollution] but now we can. The ground is contaminated, our crop yield has dropped, the maize crop is about half what it was,” said Leo Moulenga of Shimulala. “When there is a spill, the air is very acidic. Last week they spilled a lot. It was awful. In the future we don’t think people will be able to live here. It is becoming uninhabitable. The pollution has been incremental. Now it’s getting worse.”    Power failures and deficient pumps result in sulphuric acid, lead, zinc, iron and mercury being dumped into rivers  Former KCM engineer     Floribert Kappa, of Hippo Pool, said: “I used to go to the Kafue river to draw water and started drinking it as normal. I saw that fish had died and were floating on the river. We ate the fish and soon everyone started crying with stomach pains. I was given some medicine, but the pains got worse. I collapsed and was taken to a hospital. The diagnosis was that I had drunk or eaten something acidic which had caused damage to my chest and intestines. I was told the damage was permanent. Now I live on painkillers. Everyone here has been affected in some way. We all use the same water. We have tried chlorinating and boiling the water but it still smells acidic.” Last year Vedanta/KCM made up to £320m profit from the mine but engineers who have worked there say that its pollution treatment works have been pushed beyond their limits by the company to maximise output. “The feed in … has been increased to over 50,000 tonnes per day. They were designed to handle 30,000 tonnes,” said one engineer. “Degraded equipment like leaking pumps, pipes, and settling ponds have given to excessive spillages and water overflowing into the Mushishima stream and subsequently the Kafue river. It poses a possible environmental catastrophe. Power failures and deficient pumps frequently result in slurry spills and effluent containing sulphuric acid, lead, zinc, iron and mercury being dumped into rivers.” The mine has a long history of pollution from its tailing dams, processing plants and old pipes. In 2011, the high court in Lusaka ordered Vedanta/ KCM to pay about £1.3m to 2,000 residents of Chingola after sulphuric acid and other chemicals were discharged into a tributary of the Kafue in 2006.     Workers in 2006 constructing the $300m copper smelter in Chingola. Photograph: Joseph Schatz/AP    The judge said Zambians “should not be dehumanised by greed and crude capitalism which put profit above human life. KCM was reckless and had no regard for human, animal and plant life. Chingola residents were guinea pigs.” Vedanta later appealed to the supreme court, claiming that it was not responsible for the pollution. The verdict was upheld, but the supreme court reduced compensation to people affected by the spillage to virtually nothing. Much of the infrastructure of the present mine is more than 40 years old. The copper is now worked largely underground but the deep, opencast pit is one of the biggest in Africa – more than four miles long, a mile wide and 1,600ft deep. Mine waste, which is being reworked to extract copper residues, now rises in miles of 300ft hills stretching around the town of Chingola. Large-scale mining led by global companies listed on the London stock exchange has expanded dramatically in the past decade. Chinese and Indian growth and the rising price of metals has led to the exploitation of new areas of the resource-rich Amazon, India, Indonesia southern Africa and the Philippines. But the boom has been accompanied by evictions, land grabs, human rights violations and damage to water supplies, say development and human rights groups. Protests against Vedanta will take place in Chingola and Lusaka in Zambia and five Indian cities to coincide with its annual meeting in London. Vedanta responded, saying: “We have received a letter from Leigh Day [the law firm representing the villagers] making certain allegations about KCM’s mining activities in Zambia. “We are committed to fully investigating the matters alleged and we have sought further information from Leigh Day and their clients. Once we have completed that investigation we will provide Leigh Day with a full response. Until we have done that, any court proceedings are premature.”",2015-08-01T21:30:03Z,‘I drank the water and ate the fish. We all did.

"Recent media coverage of the air pollution caused by diesel vehicles has put the spotlight on a public health issue estimated to cost the UK between £9bn and £19bn per year. Until recently, much of the discussion about transport and health focused on the role of walking and cycling in tackling obesity. Air pollution is a far less visible problem, but one that contributes to nearly 29,000 premature deaths each year. The Institute of Occupational Medicine estimates that tackling the issue would have a bigger impact on life expectancy than eliminating passive smoking or road traffic accidents. However, it’s crucial that we tackle this in the right way. One of the key findings from a recent report by the RAC Foundation is that we are in danger of relying too much on technological solutions to transport-related problems. In response to a government drive for vehicles with lower carbon emissions, motor manufacturers have produced more diesel vehicles over the past decade. The unintended consequence of this rapid rise in diesel car use is poorer air quality. Yet the government’s approach to tackling air quality continues to focus on measures such as the clean vehicle technology fund. The RAC report emphasises that bold vision, commitment and political leadership are needed to tackle air pollution. The current situation could probably have been avoided if the response to climate change had focused on encouraging people to use their cars less, including by ensuring shops and other services are available locally. Not only do such measures deliver other public health benefits by encouraging more active lifestyles, they also help reduce congestion and create more attractive public spaces, generating economic activity. A recent report by the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety provides further evidence of the need for such an approach, arguing that walking has the greatest potential to deliver health benefits. Unfortunately, the opportunity for better integration between transport and health seems to have taken one step forward and two steps backwards in recent years. The big leap forward came in April 2013, when responsibility for public health was transferred to local authorities, making the same organisation responsible for transport and public health at a local level. However, cash-strapped councils are finding it increasingly difficult to fund the kind of sustainable transport initiatives that would really make a difference and their efforts are being undermined by central government’s renewed emphasis on road-building. Even organisations that are taking a more proactive approach may not be doing enough. When Transport for London published what it claims is the world’s first transport health action plan earlier this year it was described as worthless by the Green politician Jenny Jones, as it included no new measures to tackle air pollution. Outside London, a new approach to local transport expenditure has been introduced, prioritising economic growth. This makes it even harder for councils to secure funding for transport projects that improve air quality or promote healthy lifestyles. Local economic partnerships (LEPs) are responsible for billions of pounds of expenditure on transport, the majority of which is going on road-building and widening. Few have sought local people’s views on their plans. LEPs must be required to develop spending priorities that support the full range of transport policy objectives if there is to be any real prospect of reducing the impact of transport on our health.

"Air pollution is expected to be high on Thursday over the south-east of England, leading to warnings to people with respiratory difficulties. The pollution is likely to be localised, with clear skies over Scotland as people cast their ballots in the independence referendum. The pollution in the south-east is the result of weeks of low pressure, according to the Met Office, which has drawn in polluted air from the continent. Today’s levels are thought not to be as bad as those that hit England this spring, when dust from the Sahara combined with continental pollution and high levels of smog that led to some of the worst pollution of recent years, with warnings to vulnerable people, including older people and children, to stay indoors.  However, the official health advice for pollution at today’s levels in the south-east is for adults and children with lung and heart problems to reduce physical exertion, and asthma sufferers have been warned they may need their inhaler more than usual. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said in a statement: “Moderate levels of air pollution are forecast for central and southern England as well as eastern Wales. High levels may also be observed across parts of south-east and southern England. This is due to stable conditions and easterly winds bringing pollution across from the near continent.  “Scotland, Northern Ireland and much of northern England are expected to see low evels of air pollution although isolated pockets of moderate [pollution] are possible in urban or industrial areas.”     UK air pollution forecast for 18 September 2014 Photograph: UK Air / Defra    The Met Office said it was not possible to compare current pollution levels with cities such as Beijing, as such international comparisons would have to wait for longer-term reports to be drawn up. Today’s pollution is likely to be short-lived, the Met Office told the Guardian, and may dissipate as soon as tomorrow as weather conditions change. “We are due for some rain and that should wash the worst of it away,” a spokeswoman said. Defra said the pollution was not likely to be as bad as that experienced in the spring. Air pollution is a growing problem, as the UK is in breach of European regulations on the issue, with many cities not expected to be within safe levels by 2030, and faces heavy fines as a result. The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, has proposed measures such as higher congestion charging and restrictions on polluting diesel vehicles, but these will not enter into effect for several years. Campaigners have criticised the government for failing to adhere to European standards, and an influential select committee of MPs earlier this week was scathing of the government’s efforts on the problem.  The Environmental Audit Committee said that emissions of a number of airborne pollutants increased in 2013, after being steady between 2010 and 2012 and in a longer term decline before that.  Joan Walley, chair of the committee, said: “A whole generation of young people in our cities will potentially have their health impaired by pollution before the government meets air quality safety standards. That is not acceptable. We need to see much more urgent action in this area and we will be looking at this area in more detail when we publish the results of our inquiry later this year.”",2014-09-18T10:40:49Z,High air pollution levels hit south-east England,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-68119001-954d-41f7-b84c-38bbe4395c49""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/18/1411036225271/a8bdc08c-f513-46f1-b2f9-46cfb43602ba-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Planes taxi to the terminals at Heathrow Airport.

"We’ve all heard about the dangers of climate change on world food security, but by 2050 our ability to produce food may be lowered by up to 10% due to rising air pollution, according to new research published by Nature Climate Change. “Human activities have increased the concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere by over 30% during the past 200 years and this figure is expected to double by the end of the century,” says lead author Arnold Bloom. “Our report found this change in air pollution inhibits the growth of field-grown wheat by 10%.” According to Bloom, air pollution will affect both urban and rural farming alike. Field-grown wheat is a staple crop for most developing countries, so if not addressed these findings show food security will suffer more than previously predicted. Adding to the crisis, worldwide food demand is set to rise by 50% in 2050. “Climate change is already making people hungry,” says Robin Willoughby, Oxfam UK’s policy adviser on food. “Rising temperatures and increasingly extreme and erratic weather patterns are making it harder to grow enough food to eat. Unfortunately, the situation is likely to get worse, placing an additional burden for our humanitarian work as droughts and flooding become more frequent. Climate change threatens to put the fight to eradicate hunger back by decades.” So, what will rising air pollution mean for aid workers delivering food in developing countries? “As air pollution begins to effect food supply, NGOs need to promote farming techniques that conserve water and soil, especially in dry or desert areas,” says Paul Cook, advocacy director for Tearfund, an international NGO. “NGOs also need to work to give farmers in developing countries access to up-to-date information on weather, climate, disaster early warning, and markets, so they can make well-informed plans and responses. Farmers need to experiment with agricultural approaches, so they are equipped to find solutions in an ever-shifting climate.” Cook says the development sector needs to focus on getting wealthy countries to eat less. “NGOs need to help people in rich countries consume less and consume differently, and campaign for government action on climate change. In this way, we may see a different story for issues like food insecurity in 2050.” However, some people in the sector dismiss these findings, and believe food security in future depends more on socio-economic factors than climate change and resulting air pollution. Francesco Tubiello, natural resources officer for the monitoring of green house gas emissions in agriculture for the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), says: “The people that analyse the biophysical data on CO2 effects on plants are not those who can speak volumes about food security. This is because food security and malnutrition have significant dimensions that have nothing to do with science, and much to do with socio-economics.” “The reduction or increase of absolute quantities of food is a very weak proxy for current and future food security levels, as the latter depends more on the economic laws of supply and demand and of redistribution, and on non-biophysical things such as poverty, infrastructure, politics and management.” The solution lies in a more holistic approach to food security, says Duncan Williamson, food policy manager for World Wildlife Fund. “It’s not about producing more, using more nitrogen and industrialising agriculture. We already produce enough to feed over 10 billion. It’s about producing a greater variety of crops and sticking to the more traditional plant-based diets found globally from Italy to India.” Even with 10% less field-grown wheat, we are still likely to have the ability to feed the global population in 2050. The challenge for the future is the same as the one we have now: how to distribute it more equally.

"Like so many of us, I have personal experience with cancer. I’ve had it twice, and so have both of my parents, six aunts and numerous friends. Just last month, someone very close to me was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. These illnesses are more than just statistics. They require the patient, as well as their families and friends, to journey through a pretty broken medical system, and their emotional price is exorbitant.  My own cancer odyssey started about eight years ago and lasted two years. (I’ve been cancer-free for six years now and I’m doing fine, thanks). When I started feeling physically better, I felt the release of an emotional bottleneck. I went to a support group and each of the six people there told the same story: “I’m sure I got cancer for a reason and I just don’t know what it is yet.”  I responded, perhaps inappropriately: “You got cancer because a variety of companies, governments and shareholders decided that clean air, water and food were less important than their money.”  I’m sure everyone in that group was happy I never returned, but it was a great catharsis for me. At that moment, as an environmentalist working with business, my emotional self met my professional self on very clear terms. I realized we must begin including the environmental costs – including environment-related health costs – in every financial transaction. Consider this: last year, the US spent $37bn on cancer drugs and over $100bn on cancer treatment alone. Those numbers don’t include the unreported and uncovered costs, such as nurses, acupuncture, psychotherapy, personal travel, supplements and caregivers’ expenses. I spent many thousands of dollars in such costs for each of my cancers, and that’s far from unusual. Of course, those numbers also don’t include the personal costs borne by families and individuals, nor the follow-on effects of cancer treatment in the form of future weaknesses, illnesses, lost wages and lower productivity. I have grieved and tended too many friends who had cancer in their 30s and 40s, and feel absolutely certain that chemicals, drugs and hormones in the air, water and food play a role in causing this scourge. Reading about the cancer cluster of kids in Toms River, New Jersey, illustrates the difficulty of proving these connections, but for anyone reading the news or sitting by a sick bed, these connections are palpable – and science is getting closer to proving it.  Air pollution kills as many people every year as smoking does, according to Brigham Young University economist C Arden Pope III. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer lists 113 agents that are carcinogenic and 66 that likely cause cancer. These chemicals range from the familiar villains – such as tobacco, asbestos and formaldehyde – to the lesser-known fuchsine for magenta production and vinyl chloride used to make the ubiquitous PVC found in industrial pipes, plumbing, packaging and credit cards. But external environmental and social costs – including health impacts – of these chemicals aren’t often considered in the financial equations that result in their use in many products today. The costs of cancer simply don’t show up in the balance sheets of the businesses that contribute to its prevalence. GDP, for example, is one of the most important economic indicators in use. All the health care spending I mentioned earlier actually contributes to the GDP, showing up as a positive sign in the profit-and-loss-only model of economic health. When economic growth causes increased illness and healthcare costs, our measurements are missing some basics. It’s not always so great when the GDP goes up. A thriving economy needs a healthy society, not more cancer spending.  We need to construct a new financial ledger. To calculate true profit and loss, broader societal and environmental causes and effects need to be added into the equations. In other words, we need integrated reporting that includes the external environmental and social costs – including health impacts – currently not on the books. There are signs that some businesses are starting to think about these costs, whether or not they’re including them in their financial statements. Take CVS Caremark, which earlier this year unilaterally decided to forgo $2bn in annual tobacco sales because of the negative health impacts. In a recent column in the Guardian, Eileen Howard Boone, senior vice president of corporate social responsibility at CVS Caremark, wrote: “What we saw was a health epidemic with 480,000 tobacco-related deaths each year, and a $300bn annual economic wallop attributed to smoking.” The company simply looked at the toll tobacco takes on society and – in a courageous move – decided cigarettes didn’t fit into the mission of a healthcare company.  But more needs to be done. Ounces of prevention, in this case, are worth thousands of pounds of cure. Reducing the environmental factors that contribute to cancer could have benefits that ripple across all business – transferring costs from a stressed and broken healthcare system to bolstering the quality of our food, water, clothing, indoor and outdoor air. That seems like a smarter use of our money. Imagine if profit statements included the costs of illness attributable to the profits. The use of pesticides might be restricted to emergency circumstances and PVC piping would be replaced with nontoxic, greener alternatives. This truer accounting system would lead to investment in cleaner agriculture and manufacturing, and end the taxes of carbon and pollution that we already pay for our current lifestyles. Even if the overall costs end up being the same, I’d rather spend our money on cleaner industry and infrastructure instead of on chemotherapy and asthma inhalers. Wouldn’t you?

"Should face masks be part of the solution to our air pollution problems? Across East Asia masks are becoming increasingly popular and fashionable. On walks around Beijing people wearing masks showed less effects of air pollution on their heart rhythms and blood pressure compared to those with no mask, but tests also showed big differences in mask effectiveness. Masks designed for industrial work places were better than surgical-style masks and those marketed to cyclists, but a snug fit is needed for any mask to work well.Pollution advice in the UK and France also focuses on protecting your own health when air pollution is high; vulnerable people are recommended to avoid outdoor exercise for example. Rather than wearing masks, simply avoiding busy roads and polluted areas might be a great way to decrease exposure. However it is difficult to think of another every-day environmental hazard where people are advised to protect themselves.Short-term actions to tackle pollution peaks, such as the car restrictions used in Paris, can be disruptive. Control of the high pollution along the east of England on 18 and 19 July would have required actions across Belgium and northern France in the preceding days, which raises many practical problems.This leaves us with designing low-pollution cities, industry and transport systems as the only way forward. Air pollution has improved in the last decades, but with a health burden equivalent to 29,000 UK deaths in 2008 much more needs to be done.

"The Mayor of London’s office has strenuously defended the city’s record on air pollution, insisting that it is far from the worst polluted city, despite data showing that nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels have been higher than anywhere else yet recorded. Boris Johnson’s top air quality officials told the Guardian that it was “ludicrous” to put London in the same category as capitals such as Mexico City, Delhi and Beijing, and other cities.  “It’s not even comparing apples with pears, it is comparing apples with cucumbers,” said Matthew Pencharz, the mayor’s adviser on environment and energy.  Pencharz claimed other cities frequently site their air quality monitoring stations far from the sources of the worst pollution, for instance in parks, quiet roads or suburbs, but that London’s monitoring stations are “more reliable” because they are sited near busy roads. Levels of NO2 on Oxford Street in 2013 were at an annual mean of 135 μg m-3, according to samples taken by the London Air Quality Network.  Other data analysed by the European Environment Agency also showed London topping Europe’s cities for air pollution, though at lower levels than the Oxford Street samples, which were not submitted for the agency’s consideration.  Under the EEA’s analysis, Marylebone Road, a busy London road where pollution levels frequently exceed the EU’s legal maximum, was found to be the worst in Europe in 2012, with 94 μg m-3, compared to a maximum of 40 μg m-3 which is considered by the EU to be the upper safe limit for human health. The next worst European cities were Stuttgart, with 91 μg m-3 at one site and 90 μg m-3 at another, and Paris with 90 μg m-3 at one site.     NO2 data   But Pencharz said that the data cited was not representative, because other cities have fewer monitoring stations and submit less data. London had more monitoring stations than Paris or Rome, for instance, with 157 sites compared to 32 in Paris, 13 in Rome, 17 in Berlin and 19 in Amsterdam, in 2011. He also said other cities frequently sited their monitoring stations away from some of their main polluting sites, and therefore were not as reliable as the UK.  The mayor’s office said: “More monitoring stations means we can do the responsible thing and place our monitoring stations directly in the most polluted roads. Some cities place their monitoring stations in vast green parks or traffic-free courtyards, hence the lower figures they report. That’s why Oxford Street records comparatively high levels of pollution than for many other cities – but to say it is the worst of any place on Earth is misleading.”  Martin Adams of the European Environment Agency confirmed that member states could pick the data they wanted to submit on air quality, provided that it met certain criteria and a minimum number of sampling stations were included. “That is the flexibility that member states have,” he told the Guardian. “That is the responsibility of member states – to choose the monitoring stations [from which they submit data].” Pencharz also said London was leading the world’s cities in improving air quality. He has said that emissions of NOx have fallen on average by a fifth since Johnson was elected, and the number of Londoners living in areas that break EU limits for the gas had been halved. NO2 can contribute to breathing difficulties, and is a particular problem for young children, older people and susceptible adults, such as those with existing respiratory conditions. Diesel-fuelled vehicles are a major source of the pollutant, and London is facing hefty fines from the European Union for flouting NO2 limits. Johnson unveiled plans on Tuesday to double the current congestion charge for drivers of diesel-powered vehicles. He said that diesel was worse for air pollution than alternatives including petrol, electric vehicles and other transport. The new plans – which must be put out to consultation before they can be adopted – would not come into force until 2020.",2014-07-30T16:09:22Z,Boris Johnson defends London's record on air pollution,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-8e8418cb-ed19-4a62-b0fd-5074be0fb71d""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/30/1406734883052/faa1e001-5f0c-443a-8cd2-3f93db6c335f-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Researchers from King's College London found that concentrations of nitrogen dioxide in Oxford Street are the worst on earth."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Researchers from King’s College London found that concentrations of nitrogen dioxide in Oxford Street are the worst on earth.

"The dusty patch of ground in the centre of the narrow lanes and overcrowded tenements of Anand Vihar Colony is empty. No children play cricket, wrestle or run. Even when evening comes and the searing Indian summer temperatures subside, they will remain with their marbles or toys indoors in this poor Delhi neighbourhood. Basona Bhadra, 26, watches her eight-year-old son, Varu, pour water from one cup to another on her kitchen floor. “He gets breathless and ill,” she says. “He doesn’t like going out any more. He is happier at home.” Bhadra and her family moved from the city of Meerut, 50 miles away, to Anand Vihar, in the east of the Indian capital, four months ago. She blames the heat for the hacking cough that made her child abandon the energetic games he used to enjoy. Local doctors disagree. Abhinav Agarwal, a paediatrician in nearby Vaishali, says around a third of his patients suffer chronic respiratory ailments – a consequence, he says, of Delhi’s appalling pollution. Agarwal’s conclusions are backed by data. A survey released last year by the World Health Organisation found that Delhi was the most polluted city in the world, with an annual average of 153 micrograms of the most dangerous small particulates, known as PM2.5s, per cubic metre.   Related: India air pollution 'cutting crop yields by almost half'    The level was six times the WHO’s recommended maximum, 12 times US standards and more than twice the level considered safe even by Indian authorities. During winter, when lower temperatures and fires intensify the pollution, concentrations of PM2.5s routinely spike much higher, regularly reaching levels described by experts as hazardous for humans. The worst hit among Agarwal’s patients are children, particularly those aged between two and seven. “They are the most vulnerable. It’s been bad for years now. I don’t know if it’s getting worse, or not. It’s definitely not getting better,” he says. There are now fears that millions of children in India will suffer serious health problems later in life. “If you look at lung function in children [here], there is significant decline with constant exposure. This will probably be irreversible. For adults, there is also a more rapid decline than usual with age. Some suggest it is the equivalent of smoking around 10 cigarettes per day. There is also a higher chance of developing coronary and arterial disease,” says Dr Guleria, a lung specialist at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.   Related: India court slams Delhi's worsening air pollution    The WHO found that India has the world’s highest rate of death from respiratory disease, with 159 per 100,000 in 2012, about 10 times that of Italy, five times that of the UK and twice that of China. One study found that half of Delhi’s 4.4 million schoolchildren would never recover full lung capacity. Much depends on levels of exposure, which means that children, who in India often cycle or walk to school along busy roads, receive extremely high doses of toxic chemicals and damaging particulates. Daily levels in schools are four times worse than those that are supposed to trigger alerts in London. In Anand Vihar, the factors that cause pollution across Delhi are particularly severe. There is heavy traffic, swollen by often badly maintained and old trucks and buses; huge landfill rubbish dumps which are sometimes set on fire; filthy industries just a few miles from the city; two coal-fired power stations; nearby intensive construction which generates choking clouds of dust; and, seasonally, smoke from crop burning in fields from farmland in neighbouring states. Another blackspot in Delhi is Munirka, in the south of the city and close to two heavily congested ring roads. Meenu Singh, a Munirka resident whose eight-year-old son has severe asthma which doctors blame on pollution, says she would leave the city if she could.     Smog envelops buildings on the outskirts o Delhi. Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images    “I’m really worried about my child’s health. I don’t want him to be in Delhi, but we have no choice at the moment. He is missing exams and school so his education is suffering. We would hope to one day send him to boarding school and even abroad so that he can live an healthy life,” she says. Many expatriate workers have already left the city, with some major international companies now preferring to base executives in Dubai or Bangkok. Classes at international schools in the city have been cut as numbers dwindle. Delhi saw significant improvement in its air quality a decade ago following a slew of measures including converting buses and autorickshaws to run on gas, moving small industries to zones on the outskirts of the city and raising emission standards. But benefits were swiftly lost.   Related: Why an opinion article on Delhi's air pollution upset many Indians | Janaki Lenin    “We could not keep the momentum. Now there is a new challenge, and it is much more complicated,” says Anumita Choudhury of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a Delhi thinktank. Choudhury says the problem is a “mobility crisis” in Delhi as use of private vehicles has soared while public transport has suffered chronic under-investment. Between 1991 and 2011, the population of Delhi and its adjoining cities more than doubled to 22 million while the number of registered cars and motorbikes increased fivefold to around 8m. “We love our cars these days and middle class families have two, three, four of them,” says Surender Sharma, a retired senior air force officer in Delhi who moved to the top floor of a high rise block on the city’s outskirts three years ago to escape air pollution. Environmentalists say between 40% and 50% of the dangerous PM2.5 particulates in Delhi are caused by vehicles. The figures have been challenged by the car industry. One major problem, all admit, is the 70,000 trucks which drive through the city every night on long-distance journeys. A plan to build a bypass has been repeatedly delayed. A new metro has barely made an impact, experts say, as almost all those who use it were previously using buses or bicycles, not cars.     Police officers wear masks as they control traffic in Delhi. Photograph: Altaf Qadri/AP    After being ignored by the media and politicians for many years, the problem of toxic air is now becoming a significant domestic issue with newspapers highlighting the problem. “Clean air is a human right,” Prakash Javadekar, the environment minister, said earlier this year. The Bharatiya Janata party government won a landslide victory at an election last year. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, campaigned on a promise of boosting India’s flagging growth. It has been unclear how he intends to reconcile economic development with protection of India’s forests and rivers and an improvement in air quality. Conflicts between local and national governments, and between agencies, have also hampered efforts. The result is that no significant policies beyond a national air monitoring index have yet been announced, while many measures introduced elsewhere, such as closing schools during spikes of pollution or forcing old vehicles off the road, have been rejected.   Related: 'My children are suffering but what can I do?' Delhi's polluted air, by the people who live there    “Only 14% of individual journeys in Delhi are made in private vehicles. It is a small minority who are determining policy in this city so the majority voice has to come out louder to determine travel and investment choices,” says Choudhury, of the CSE. The problem is not restricted to the capital. According to the WHO, 13 of the dirtiest 20 cities in the world are in India. Medical experts fear a failure to act rapidly could be costly in the long run. “We have a very young population currently being exposed [to severe pollution] and they will have very significant health problems in 15 to 20 years’ time. We are just looking at this in terms of short-term economic growth. The health cost has been forgotten,” says Guleria, the lung specialist.",2015-06-24T06:54:55Z,Child health fears at the most polluted spot in the world's most polluted city,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""7cf25ed9609a19a18858ab581e82d02c5f1835c1""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434728510614/2eb20871-6bd1-42c6-a52e-e1c880efd0f1-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Children cover their faces to try to protect themselves from air pollution in the Indian capital."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Children cover their faces to try to protect themselves from air pollution in the Indian capital.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Hindustan Times/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",56,Delhi’s appalling pollution has prompted fears that millions of youngsters will suffer serious health problems later in life ,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434728510934/2eb20871-6bd1-42c6-a52e-e1c880efd0f1-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/24/indian-children-fall-victim-to-delhis-appalling-pollution,6,negative
"Following Zoe Williams’s article on pollution in the capital I’d like to reassure readers that the recent spate of alarmist claims are ridiculous and taken out of context (Welcome to London – the planet’s most toxic town, 8 July). Emissions research “has found nitrogen dioxide concentrations on Oxford Street to be worse than they are anywhere else on Earth”, Williams says. Anyone who has visited Beijing, Mexico City or Delhi really knows what bad air pollution looks and feels like. Pollution levels in London are in fact lower than in many other world cities: average levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from monitoring sites near busy roads in Stuttgart, Paris, Munich, Rome and Milan are all higher than those recorded for London. Some cities place their monitoring stations in vast green parks or traffic-free courtyards, hence the lower figures they report. We do the responsible thing and place our monitoring stations directly in the most polluted roads. Most experts do not rank locations, precisely because of the variability between sites, and as such it’s misleading to talk about a “worst location”. Even though it was estimated in 2010 that there were 50,000 premature deaths a year in the UK, says Williams, “pollution still isn’t taken seriously as a health issue”. At City Hall we are the first to admit that London’s air quality is not good enough. Buses and taxis are major contributors to air pollution on busy roads, so we’ve retired 900 of the oldest buses, and are putting 1,700 ultra-low emission hybrid buses on our streets. Removing 3,000 of the oldest, most polluting taxis met initial opposition but we have pushed on: from 2018 all new taxis will be capable of zero emissions. We’ve also been busy making 400,000 homes and public buildings energy-efficient and have established a £20m fund to tackle air quality hotspots. We’ve reduced emissions of NOx by 20% and particulates by 15% since the mayor was elected, and we have halved the number of Londoners living in areas that break EU limits for NO2. The mayor is now drawing up plans for an ultra-low emission zone from 2020, which no other city has ever proposed. This is expected to more than halve emissions of NOx and dangerous particles. “The fact that only 2% of [children] cycle to school, compared with 50% in the Netherlands, is attributable to the fact that we don’t take road safety seriously across the country,” says Williams. City Hall has invested millions into reclaiming public space for pedestrians and cyclists. As a cyclist I’ve personally appreciated these changes, and the £1bn investment into cycling, which has seen a 55% increase since the mayor was elected. And with more measures, continuous monitoring and a pollution awareness campaign set to launch this autumn, I hope any reasonable observer would agree that London is in the vanguard of improving air quality.",2014-07-24T18:31:51Z,"London, far from being toxic, is leading the way in tackling air pollution","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-2a9406f9-6e11-4520-a5bc-2d09eca05a79""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/24/1406226610510/cyclist-Oxford-Street-The-011.jpg"" alt=""cyclist Oxford Street The Most Polluted Place In The World"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A cyclist passes buses and taxis in London's Oxford Street.

"To learn about exposure to traffic pollution, scientists in Boston, Massachusetts, pedalled around their city towing an instrumented trailer. Their results provide useful information for cycle lane design. Perhaps unsurprisingly, least exposure to traffic exhaust was found where cycle paths were separated from roads, especially when lined by hedges and trees. More air pollution was found on bike lanes that run alongside traffic and most pollution was found where cyclists shared bus lanes.Good cycle paths cost money but the potential pay-back from increasing cycling and walking is huge. A six-mile-a-day car commuter who switches to cycling to work could lead to health savings of around £1,000 per year from increased exercise. Extra benefit also comes from less exhaust emissions. On the downside, cyclists breathe faster and journey time also alters the pollution dose.The risk of increased accidents from switching to cycling varies from place to place. Driving and cycling are thought to be equally risky in the Netherlands where cycle facilities are good, but cycling is more dangerous than driving in Paris. Despite this, the benefit from cycling is still more than ten times the increased health cost from accidents and pollution exposure. As an alternative to policies that focus on cleaning up vehicle exhausts, a switch to active travel provides many more benefits.The potential to increase cycling in the UK has been recognised by the Parliamentary Cycling Group. They have called for cycling spending to be increased from the English city-average of £2 to £10 per head to boost cycling from two per cent of journeys to ten per cent by 2020.",2014-07-13T20:30:01Z,Pollutionwatch: Still better by bike,,58,"<strong>Gary Fuller</strong> assesses the pros and cons of cycling to work, including exposure to air pollution and risk of accidents, and finds that the pros greatly outweigh the cons",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/11/1405093663678/Cyclists-London-006.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/13/pollutionwatch-air-pollution-cycling,8,positive
"At 4am I shot out of bed as an explosion outside shook the room. Half an hour earlier, I had crawled beneath my duvet, naively imagining the barrage was almost over. It was February 2008 and Beijing had reached its pyrotechnic peak. On previous trips I had fallen in love with China’s exuberance and energy; the exhilaration of watching a country transforming at breakneck speed. Now the capital was celebrating lunar new year with the most spectacular fireworks display I have ever seen. The skyline bloomed red and green and golden in an unending show of confidence, joy and wealth. The freezing air was sulphurous as I looked out over my new home: a city of brutal office blocks, gleaming malls, high-rise towers and slums; above all, of building sites – the massive construction efforts for the Olympics were still at full pelt. But Beijing was also, still, a city of ancient alleyways, trees bearing fat orange persimmons and old men walking in the parks with caged thrushes.     Fireworks during lantern festival celebrations in Chongqing municipality, China, February 2008. Photograph: China Photos/Getty Images    People joke that, after a month in China, you can write a book on it; after a year, you can write an essay; after five, perhaps a sentence. I loved the seven years I spent there, but nothing is as absurd as the idea of being a “specialist” on a country that holds a fifth of the world’s population, has an extraordinarily rich and turbulent history, boasts immense geographic, ethnic and cultural diversity, and is changing faster than one can imagine. In my time there, China overtook Germany and Japan to become the world’s second largest economy; in terms of purchasing power parity, it has now passed the US. It grabbed the most golds at the 2008 Olympics, and opened scores of new airports, hundreds of museums and 7,500 miles of high-speed train track. Tycoon Wang Jianlin became the owner of the world’s largest cinema chain by acquiring 5,000 screens in the US. Internet firm Alibaba held the largest ever global IPO. Chinese firms took stakes in Thames Water, Heathrow Airport and Weetabix. Yet every subsequent new year, celebration seemed a little more muted. Tighter fireworks rules were imposed after a luxury hotel went up in flames, but official controls weren’t the only factor. The rich have cut back on ostentatious displays – particularly since the crackdown on corruption began – while the poor have proved less willing to splurge, equally uncertain of what the future holds. This year was the most subdued of all. Though the horizon was still spangled with colour, explosions were far sparser. There were fewer injuries; the air was cleaner; Beijing’s streets quieter and safer – but also rather less fun. China is in many ways a more confident nation since 2008. In others it is becalmed and anxious. My arrival coincided with the end of a run of double-digit annual growth rates. In 2015, growth is likely to be around half its 2007 rate of 13%. Its economic path is less certain and more cluttered, even if the leadership still has tools to hand. Heavy-handed censorship has taken the steam out of once rambunctious social media. Officials have even sought to rein in the middle-aged dancing women who have colonised the country’s public squares and compound courtyards with blaring music and elaborate choreography. Since taking over in late 2012, Xi Jinping has consolidated power – both his personal authority, and that of the party – to a degree that no one envisioned. A drive to crack down on activists – accompanied by a general ideological tightening – has seen hundreds held or imprisoned. The recent detention of five feminists who had merely planned to highlight sexual harassment through a sticker campaign was particularly alarming. They have been released on bail after an international outcry, but charges still hang over their heads. Scholars are noticeably more cautious in addressing potentially sensitive issues; NGOs face draconian new rules.     Liu Xiaobo and his wife Liu Xia in Beijing. Photograph: AFP/AFP/Getty Images    The beginnings of this shift were evident even in my first year. Nobel peace prize-winner Liu Xiaobo was detained hours before we were due to meet in December 2008, and subsequently jailed for 11 years; his wife Liu Xia lives under house arrest. Scholar and activist Xu Zhiyong, the outspoken Uighur academic Ilham Tohti and veteran journalist Gao Yu are among many imprisoned during my tenure, and even famed artist Ai Weiwei was held for 81 days. Pu Zhiqiang, one of China’s most prominent human rights lawyers, awaits trial on charges of inciting ethnic hatred. The blind grassroots legal activist Chen Guangcheng left, after fleeing captivity and seeking refuge in the US embassy. Lawyer Teng Biao, HIV/Aids activist Wan Yanhai and writer Yu Jie are among many others who have found new homes overseas. Journalism, too, has become more difficult, though most of all for domestic reporters. Chinese authorities relaxed strict rules governing foreign correspondents to meet their commitment to free reporting of the Olympics. Yet much of the progress has been reversed. Officials declare areas off limits on an ad hoc basis; reporters waiting outside sensitive trials face increased pressure. Media that investigated the wealth of leaders’ families have been refused new visas. Of greatest concern is the intimidation and harassment of local staff and sources, who as Chinese citizens, are far more vulnerable. Tensions that broke through the surface in my first year have mounted. In March 2008, the worst riots in Lhasa for almost 20 years exploded after the suppression of peaceful protests by monks. It was followed by an attack that killed 16 police in Xinjiang in August. The following years have seen an increasingly heavy-handed response by Beijing, murderous ethnic violence in the north-western region and attacks beyond, and large numbers of self-immolations by Tibetans.     The devastated town of Beichuan in China’s earthquake ravaged Sichuan province in May 2009. Photograph: Peter Parks/AFP/Getty Images    Perhaps the defining moment of that first year was the devastating earthquake that left 90,000 dead or missing in Sichuan and showed China at its best and worst. The authorities rescued, fed and sheltered unimaginable numbers in a fast and mostly efficient operation. Modern infrastructure sped recovery efforts. People reacted with humbling resilience, dignity and compassion. Yet I walked through rubble choked with the corpses of dead children, crushed to death in shoddily built schools – evidence of the tendency to cut corners and rampant corruption that skimmed cash from construction budgets. Bereaved parents asking why their children had been betrayed were detained and harassed by authorities.  The global economic crisis hit towards the end of the year; China responded with a gargantuan stimulus package. It fostered a sense that China now mattered; but the cost of the rescue – sky-high debt – was evident. It showed what the Chinese government could do; it also underscored the limitations of the country’s investment-led model. Beijing is finally attempting to rebalance the economy after years of promising to do so, just as it is taking steps to tackle the pollution problem and carbon emissions; like so many of the country’s reform efforts (especially to the household registration system, or birth control policies, or the law on domestic violence), the changes fall far short of what is needed. It is easy to overlook the country’s real achievements, measured not just by the miles of tarmac, still less its numerous billionaires, but by the slashing of the neonatal mortality rate and the rolling out of social and medical insurance. Hu Jintao’s administration (2002-2012) has been written off by many, yet it built the skeleton of a welfare state at remarkable speed. The trope that hundreds of millions have been “lifted out” of poverty is wrong and insulting; they have hauled themselves out. But government policies matter too and not all officials are venal, corrupt or self-serving. Some are truly trying to improve lives under tough circumstances. Sometimes they succeed. It is also easy to overlook the problems, and not only because of the profits to be made in China. Negative stereotypes can rebound: visitors are sometimes surprised not to be followed down the street. When they hear individuals berate authorities, or see them gather in an angry protest, they flip too easily to the assumption that people are entirely free and criticism unfounded. Worse, they may assume that those with grievances have gone looking for trouble. Few seek confrontation with power; more often, a single injustice sets them on an irreversible course. An attempt to right a wrong leads to beatings or pressure on their families, making them angrier or opening their eyes to the problems faced by others. It’s true that Western governments appear hypocritical when they criticise China for abuses, while glossing over the invasion of Iraq, Guantánamo Bay, extraordinary rendition, Abu Ghraib and so forth. That does not mean they should bite their tongues, but put their own houses in order. Honesty is all the more important as China becomes increasingly assertive in the international realm. During the global financial crisis, it shied away from talk of joining with the US as the “G2” and still avoids the word “superpower”, with its connotations of hegemony. Yet these days it is keen to promote its “new type of great power relationship” with Washington. Last year, Xi told a French audience that the “peaceful, pleasant and civilised” lion of China had woken up. The US, and others in the region, fear it is showing its claws and is ready to bite. The Chinese armed forces have had years of double-digit budget increases. The country is island-building in the South China Sea and has proved increasingly assertive in territorial rows there and elsewhere. Still, its military spending remains dwarfed by America’s, and other countries are also reclaiming land in disputed waters, albeit much more slowly. China, too, has anxieties about containment by the US and a more hawkish Japan. And some of its frustrations internationally are understandable: Washington has been reluctant to see greater Chinese clout at the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, but is also hostile to the Beijing-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Geopolitical tensions and horrifying or scandalous news stories studded my tenure. Families of those aboard Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 are no closer to learning what has happened to their loved ones. And who could have predicted the melodrama of flamboyant politician Bo Xilai’s fall, after his wife was accused of murdering a British businessman, Neil Heywood? But it is the deeper trends that will determine China’s future – urbanisation and increasing mobility; the demographic timebomb of a shrinking workforce and ageing population; the increasing frustration of young women faced with glaring discrimination; changing sexual mores and romantic expectations; the tension between Hong Kong’s increasingly independent identity and Beijing’s determination to bring it into line. The anti-corruption campaign has proved popular, but many remain cynical towards all aspects of authority. People are increasingly angry about the environmental cost of growth and especially its impact on health. Soaring inequalities – between urban and rural, rich and poor – have sparked bitter resentment. When I passed a crashed sports car one day, an old man looked at me and muttered: “It would be better if rich people just died.” Of course, China has lessons for us too. Older people are generally respected and treated as a valued part of society, making me all the more aware and ashamed of the isolation they often face in the west. There is an aggressively nationalist streak and a sometimes absurd suspicion of outsiders, often fanned by authorities; last year, when I asked how vegetable prices at a market were faring, a vendor retorted, quite seriously: “If we tell you, we’ll be like foreign spies.” But the Britain I have returned to is not only increasingly hostile to Europe and immigration; it is startlingly ignorant of the non-western world. How many British politicians have read one book by a Chinese author? (Anyone citing Sun Tzu’s The Art of War should subtract a mark here.) How many Britons even know about the opium wars? Chinese people are far more informed about the British than vice versa, even if their understanding is often as flawed as ours. I don’t mean just the youthful elite who watch Sherlock, but the shopworker who quizzed me on Isambard Kingdom Brunel’s career and, astonishingly, the cab driver who asked how Harold Macmillan was regarded in Britain today. Once, visiting an impoverished rural school in Guizhou, I was struck by an unexpected face on the wall, between Mao and Marx. The third place of honour had been granted to the Scottish engineer James Watt.     A woman wearing a face mask to protect against smog in Beijing in January 2014. Photograph: Wang Zhao/AFP/Getty Images    I don’t miss China’s smog and dust; still less the injustices that I witnessed. But I loved the energy, the curiosity and friendliness of strangers, and the knowledge I lapped up on everything from Maoist model operas to dinosaurs. I miss cold noodles, scalding xiao long bao soup dumplings and fresh tanghulu (a superior take on toffee apples). At least Laoganma’s addictive chilli black bean sauce is available in the UK. I’ll miss strolling down the hutongs on summer days, skating on frozen lakes in winter, and watching the sun rise over a snow-dusted, crumbling stretch of the Great Wall after a long scrabble uphill through the darkness. China’s rich literary history remains easily accessible, as does the endless linguistic inventiveness and subversive wit of internet users, but its other cultural treasures are now a long-haul flight away: Sichuan’s lush valleys, Gansu’s desert, and Beijing’s ginkgo trees and and beautiful azure-winged magpies. And no, new year will not be the same without those free firework displays.     Chinese salad for sale in a street market in Beijing in November 2014. Photograph: Fred Dufour/AFP/Getty Images    Above all, I will miss the friends I made and the kindness of all those – factory workers, artists, scholars, farmers and campaigners – who welcomed me, helped me to understand their country and shared their aspirations, dreams and fears for its future. I suspect the next few years will prove less spectacular than those I witnessed; I hope, but do not expect that they may be happier.

"David Cameron is warming to the idea of backing a second runway at Gatwick amid growing worries within government that expansion of Heathrow would cause excessive pollution and noise and would split the Tory party, according to informed sources. A final report on how best to increase airport capacity in the south-east will be published by Sir Howard Davies, chairman of the Airports Commission, next month or in July, and will contain a firm recommendation on which of the two airports should be developed to handle increasing demand. The government will not be bound by the Davies recommendation, however, and with Cameron keen to re-emphasise his commitment to green issues in his second term as prime minister, there is pressure on ministers to find a solution that is both politically acceptable and which best meets legal air quality and other environmental requirements. Davies has surprised Gatwick and Heathrow lobbyists by ordering a new consultation on implications for air quality, which will conclude this Friday and inform his final decision. The appointment last week of green enthusiast Camilla Cavendish as head of the Downing Street policy unit has also raised the hopes of those opposing Heathrow, who argue that air quality around the airport already exceeds legal limits and would breach EU regulations if further expansion was allowed, while adding that air and noise pollution problems would be far less if Gatwick were chosen. A source involved in the debate said Cameron was now more enthusiastic about the Gatwick option. Another key figure in the debate said he was aware that if ministers opted for Heathrow then at least two of his potential successors as Tory leader – Boris Johnson and Theresa May, who both have seats affected by the Heathrow flight path – would publicly oppose the move and could reverse the decision if they ever became PM.     London mayor Boris Johnson has opposed the expansion of Heathrow. Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA    Davies has already rejected Johnson’s idea of a new airport in the Thames estuary but the mayor of London, who is also now the Tory MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, has vowed to fight any expansion of Heathrow, which he says will blight the lives of millions of people in the west of the capital. While he believes a new second runway at Gatwick will not answer the capacity needs, he has focused his fire mainly on Heathrow. May, the home secretary, Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, and Justine Greening, the international development secretary, are also on record as opposing Heathrow. Both the Tories and Labour said before the election that they would “wait for Davies” before deciding where expansion should take place. Heathrow insists that it can add capacity while meeting air pollution limits. In a policy paper it states: “New public transport options will provide an alternative to travelling to the airport by road. A congestion charge would provide a new mechanism for managing demand and ensuring there will be no more Heathrow-related vehicles on the roads than today. Those vehicles that are travelling to the airport will be cleaner. Combined with new aircraft technology, this means that levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) would be within EU limits.” Gatwick maintains, on the other hand, that while Heathrow expansion would mean 320,000 more households being affected by noise, a second runway at Gatwick would affect far fewer and could be delivered at lower cost. Ministers are refusing to comment publicly before Davies reports. But another source close to the argument said: “The judgment will be made on what is politically deliverable which is partly about what is acceptable environmentally. It was issues around air pollution that prevented Heathrow expansion in 2003 and the concerns have not been answered.”",2015-05-23T18:23:35Z,David Cameron ‘warming’ to Gatwick expansion plan,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""67ffa2ec66081ea09db89156e8da1943d95aef83""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/23/1432399655596/Aerial-View-Of-Londons-He-005.jpg"" alt=""Aerial View Of London's Heathrow Airport"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Gatwick is emerging as the favoured candidate for airport expansion with the PM, say sources.

"European countries must not allow industry experts in their national delegations to lobby for weaker coal standards, the European commission’s top environment official has said. The move follows revelations by the Guardian that big energy lobbyists included in British delegations to Brussels mounted a sustained and aggressive drive for weaker limits on toxic pollutants that are responsible for over 20,000 deaths a year in the UK alone. The new instruction by the commission’s director-general for the environment, Karl Falkenberg, was outlined in a letter to his counterparts in all 28 EU countries, dated 20 May and seen by the Guardian. Falkenberg said that lines dividing national representatives, industry experts and NGOs should be strictly adhered to in the technical working groups (TWGs) that negotiate emissions standards. “Whilst nothing precludes that the industries concerned or NGOs can assist member state representatives in exchanging information, it must be clear that during TWG meetings and indeed, in all other TWG proceedings, a member state representative presents the views of its national authorities,” he wrote.  Industry experts and NGOs in national delegations “should ensure that their expressed views are fully consistent with the views of their member state,” he added. A Greenpeace analysis earlier this year found that most of the 352 working group members tasked with drawing up new air pollutions controls were either employed by the companies being regulated, or by lobby groups representing those companies. Five out of the UK’s nine-strong delegation worked for big energy firms such as RWE, EDF and E.On. Although such members are not supposed to negotiate, in practice the Guardian discovered that they made multiple comments, requests and lobby pushes, focused on the purported costs of tighter pollution standards for their businesses. They also advanced measures to weaken limits for nitrogen oxide emissions from gas plants. Louise Hutchins, a campaigner at Greenpeace welcomed the commission’s rebuke to practices that could allow lobbyists to pose as government representatives.  “Thanks to this infiltration, proposed limits on toxic emissions are now so weak they would allow Europe’s coal plants to pollute more than some of their notorious Chinese counterparts,” she said. “The damage has been done, but government officials are still in time to reverse some of it. With tighter rules, thousands of lives and billions in health and economic costs could still be saved in the EU every year.” A Greenpeace study recently found that the EU’s draft rules for coal plant emissions could result in 71,000 deaths and £52bn in health costs across Europe in the next decade, compared to the best available techniques. The new pollution standards are expected to be finalised next year.

"There's something that kills 3,000 Australians a year. You probably won't have read about this significant danger.It's not cancer. It's not sharks, or drop bears, or funnel web spiders. And it's not car accidents or heroin overdoses.It causes serious health problems for even more Australians each year, and for many people there is no ""safe"" level of exposure.It also targets disadvantaged (socially and economically) people the most.What is it?Air pollution.A new report from Environment Justice Australia, released on Wednesday, shows that 3000 people die prematurely from air pollution each year.According to EJA:Australia lacks an effective system of regulation for air pollution. The current system is based on a completely unsatisfactory arrangement that leaves important standards to protect health to be set by complex intergovernmental arrangements involving commonwealth, state and territory governments. This system is failing to adequately protect public health.It may be convenient for some to dismiss this as simply concerns from environmental do-gooders. But anti-carbon price crusader and federal environment minister Greg Hunt has acknowledged the problem, saying at a speech in March this year:At the very highest level, I would like to complete a National Clean Air Agreement by 1 July 2016. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare estimated that urban air pollution was responsible for more than 3000 early deaths in 2003. This is a critical national issue and I would like it to be a signature objective of my watch.Particle (as particulate matter) and ozone pollution levels are of particular concern, with peak particulate matter levels frequently exceeding the current national air quality standard in most of Australia's metropolitan areas.Urbanisation and population growth, and the associated increases in transport demand and energy consumption, will likely result in increased emissions and poorer air quality despite the current air quality management frameworks in place.This is a remarkable statement, showing that the federal government is not only aware of this problem, but sees the solution as national regulation.Air pollution in Australia is woefully regulated and the current measures are utterly inadequate.The road toll in Australia in 2013 was 1193 people. Each state in Australia takes road safety so seriously that they have insurance schemes, who run massive, multimillion-dollar safety-awareness campaigns.Since 1788, according to Australian Geographic, just 194 people have died from shark attacks. Yet the Western Australian government introduced a shameful and mishandled shark cull, spending $5,700 a day on a ineffective policy.The 3,000 preventable deaths caused by air pollution should be a national scandal.Unfortunately, despite the fine words from Greg Hunt, the ""Commonwealth Government recently shut down the inter-governmental committee tasked with driving the national reform process to improve Australian air quality. It also announced that the National Plan for Clean Air that Commonwealth, State and Territory governments agreed in 2011 to establish would be delayed until July 2016.""The impacts of air pollution currently falls predominantly on the poor and disadvantaged.

Pollution in China is infamous, responsible for 172 deaths for every 100,000, and The Guardian reported that one in five deaths in the UK is linked to air pollution.The World Health Organization released a report in March this year that stated that ""air pollution caused more deaths worldwide than AIDS, diabetes and road injuries combined"" and is responsible for ""one in eight of total global deaths"". That's more than 7 million people a year in 2012 alone, making it the single largest environmental health risk on earth.The solution to this problem is clear.

"The Chinese government has announced plans to take up to 6 million vehicles that don’t meet emission standards off the roads by the end of the year, in a bid to reduce the country’s air pollution problems. The move is part of a plan published by China’s cabinet, the State Council, which outlined emission targets for a number of industries over the next two years. The State Council said that some pollution targets are not being met for the 2011-2013 period and that action needs to be stepped up.  China is facing a “tough situation” in hitting its targets for energy and emissions for 2015, Xu Shaoshi, Chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission was quoted by state media.  One fifth of the vehicles to be scrapped will be in the northern regions of China, which have been the worst hit with air pollution. Hebei province, where seven of China’s smoggiest cities are located, has been ordered to scrap 660,000 cars that don’t meet emission standards. Up to 333,000 will be taken off the roads in the capital Beijing and 160,000 in Shanghai.  More vehicles will be scrapped next year with up to 5 million being removed from the roads of highly developed regions including the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta and the smog-choked region of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei. “Strengthening control on vehicle emissions will be a major agenda item for the country’s energy savings, emissions reductions, and low-carbon development during the next two years,” the plan said.  According to the state news agency, Xinhua, removing these older vehicles from the roads will help China to meet some of its green targets such as reducing energy consumption, and will also help to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide by 2% a year and emissions of nitrogen oxides by 5% per year.  The Ministry of Environmental Protection said that 7.8% of cars on China’s roads do not meet the minimum national standards. According to figures published by Xinhua, 31.1% of air pollution in Beijing comes from vehicle exhaust emissions.  A number of Chinese cities have started restricting vehicle licenses as a way of reducing car use. The city of Hangzhou recently restricted the number of new car licenses it issues and will only issue new plates via an auction and lottery. The cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Guiyang and Tianjin also limit the number of new vehicles registered each year.  According to the plan issued by the State Council, the government will also reduce coal consumption and introduce more green technologies. Xu Shaoshi was quoted in state media saying that a report will be published monthly on how regions are carrying out energy reductions.  The State Council also issued guidelines to increase food safety. In a statement, it said that there will be more measures taken to deal with soil and water pollution. There will also be punishment for those who are found to be using banned pesticides.  Tackling pollution has become a top priority for the Chinese government. Years of rapid economic development have left the country with high levels of air, soil and water pollution.  The often hazardous levels of air pollution in some cities regularly make headlines worldwide.

"• The tussle between the campaign group Clean Air in London and London's mayor, Boris Johnson, ratchets up – with the release of more specially commissioned cartoons critiquing his record on the environment and finding him wanting. You may recall that Boris, invited to endorse the group's effort to start a debate about air quality, declined. It's tricky territory for the mayor. He promised an atmosphere of ski-slope freshness. Instead, he faces claims that yuck, smog and harmful gases contribute to 4,300 deaths a year. Now he's apparently ducking a chance to discuss it with MPs. An invitation to appear before the Commons environmental audit committee would appear to have been batted away. The mayor plans to dispatch an underling and MPs cannot compel him to appear because select committees lack that power. That doesn't preclude a goodwill acceptance, of course. Maybe he's heading abroad to take the Alpine air.• As the woes of the economy and an ongoing political crisis dominate French headlines, the media also flags up another debate of high importance: ""Anorexic princesses?""

""Before her wedding, Kate's engagement ring had to be reduced by two ring sizes to fit her shrunken finger. Because the minute her image advisers had told her the TV cameras at the wedding would add 2kg, she had begun to pay special attention to her weight."" Rania's no better, he claims. ""I once spent several days with her, so she couldn't lie to me about what she'd been eating."" She couldn't wish for a more reliable confidant, you might think. But then, none seem to consume in the quantities that Bern regards as appropriate.

"The US supreme court endorsed the Environmental Protection Agency&apos;s efforts to deal with air pollution blowing across state lines on Tuesday, in an important victory for the Obama administration as well as downwind states. The court&apos;s 6-2 decision unblocks a 2011 rule requiring 28 eastern states to reduce power-plant emissions that carry smog and soot particles across state lines, hurting the air quality in downwind states. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing the court&apos;s majority opinion, said the EPA&apos;s formula for dealing with cross-state air pollution was “permissable, workable and equitable”. Justice Samuel Alito recused himself, and justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas dissented. The decision delivers an important victory to the EPA which has wrestled for years with trying to regulate air pollution as it moves beyond smokestacks and tailpipes. It is also a win for states such as Connecticut, where 93% of air pollution is from out-of-state sources. Major power companies, such as Southern Company and American Electric Power Company, and states such as Texas, Michigan and Ohio had sued to block the rule. The Washington DC court of appeals put the rule on hold in 2012. The reversal of that ruling now means that about 1,000 power plants, mainly in the eastern half of the country, will have to adopt new pollution controls to limit emissions of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide. Air pollution remains a growing problem in America despite decades of environmental protection –and Ginsburg acknowledged the complexities of putting a regulatory regime in place. “Pollutants do not emerge from the smokestacks of an upwind state and uniformly migrate downwind. Some pollutants stay with­ in upwind states’ borders, the wind carries others to downwind states, and some subset of that group drifts to states without air quality problems,” Ginsburg wrote, going on to quote a phrase from the Bible. “In craft­ing a solution to the problem of interstate air pollution, regulators must account for the vagaries of the wind.” Regulators also had to take into account that emissions are transformed into different pollutants as they travel downwind, Ginsburg wrote. Under the EPA rule, each upwind state was allocated a budget for total amount of pollution they could produce in a year. The dissenting states had argued they should be allowed to create their own plans to cut emissions to solve the problem. However, the supreme court disagreed, arguing that would lead to “costly over-regulation”. “[The] EPA’s cost-effective allocation of emission reductions among upwind States, we hold, is a permissible, workable, and equitable interpretation of the Good Neighbor Provision,” the court said. Justice Scalia in his Dissent said the EPA rule was an &quot;undemocratic revision&quot; of the clean air act. &quot;Today&apos;s decision feeds the uncontrolled growth of the administrative state at the expense of government by the people,&quot; he said in a statement read from the bench. The EPA had tried three times over the last two decades to control air pollution wafting across state lines, the court said. Congress has also weighed in dozens of times. The EPA argued when the rule was originally adopted in 2011 smog and particle pollution from power plants caused 34,000 premature deaths every year, and triggered more than 400,000 asthma attacks. Environmental groups cheered the decision.  The EPA administrator, Gina McCarthy, said the decision was &quot;a resounding victory for public health.&quot; The American Lung Association, which had joined the lawsuit, said on Tuesday the court decision was a “life-saving standard”. “The people in these 28 states needed the EPA to enforce the law and protect them from pollution,” it said in a statement. Opponents said the decision departed from the intent of the clean air act – that the EPA and states work together to cut pollution.  &quot;The Supreme Court majority has refused to allow the states to have any voice in the practicalities of determining the impact of their emissions on neighboring states,&quot; said Richard Faulk, director of the energy and law centre at George Mason University and a partner in a corporate law firm.",2014-04-29T19:11:19Z,US supreme court's pollution ruling 'a victory for Obama administration',"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-61adea39-cc47-481a-8f37-b31bbd68a2ff""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/29/1398787107051/019be695-6d12-4b8c-b03e-7dbc1cc4fecd-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""The Supreme Court on Tuesday handed the Obama administration an important victory in its effort to reduce power plant pollution"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The supreme court on Tuesday handed the Obama administration an important victory in its effort to reduce power plant pollution Photograph: Matt Brown/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>",66,"Supreme court ruling over EPA's powers means about 1,000 power plants will have to adopt new pollution controls",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/29/1398787107418/019be695-6d12-4b8c-b03e-7dbc1cc4fecd-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/29/us-supreme-court-air-pollution-ruling-obama,5,neutral

"Nearly half of all Americans live in areas with unhealthy levels of air pollution, according to an American Lung Association (ALA) report released Wednesday.Nearly 148 million people live in areas where smog and soot particles make it unhealthy to breathe the air, according to the ALA's annual study on US air quality.The report, which is based on data collected between 2010 and 2012, found smog, or ozone, had worsened in 22 of the 25 biggest US metropolitan areas, including Los Angeles, Houston, Washington-Baltimore, New York City and Chicago – and said there was a high risk of more high-ozone days because of climate change.""Weather played a factor,"" the report said. ""The warmer summers in 2010 and 2012 contributed to higher ozone readings and more frequent ozone days. Sunlight and heat create conditions that increase the risk of high ozone levels.""Smog, or ozone, which is the most widespread air pollutant, forms more readily in hotter temperatures, and is expected to increase under climate change. ""It's going to make it harder to clean up air pollution,"" said Janice Nolen of the ALA. ""Days that wouldn't ordinarily have high ozone levels are going to have them.""She added: ""It's going to be much harder to keep ozone pollution down to the levels that we should be breathing.""There is growing concern globally – including in the US – about the health risks of air pollution. The report's release comes a day after the supreme court endorsed the Environmental Protection Agency's efforts to deal with smog and soot that travel across state lines. The ALA had joined that case on behalf of the EPA. The group has also been pushing hard to tighten air pollution standards, and has supported the EPA's moves to force power plants to cut carbon dioxide emissions.Scientific research shows that smog and soot are far more harmful at lower levels than previously thought. A growing body of research over the last decade has connected air pollution to increased deaths from heart disease and respiratory illnesses. The World Health Organisation said last autumn that particulate pollution causes lung cancer.Air pollution in New Delhi rose to record levels in winter, triggering a debate about whether the Indian capital had now caught up with Beijing. Britain was on smog alert earlier this month after recording very high levels of air pollution.Meanwhile, California's pollution control officers warned this month that extreme heat and wildfires could set back decades of improvements in air quality, boosting smog formation and spewing dangerous smoke into the air.Eighteen of the 25 US cities with the worst particulate pollution saw a drop in year-round particle pollutants because of cuts in emissions for coal-fired power plants and other measures. Thirteen of them, including Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and Atlanta, registered their lowest ever levels. But the report said those cities still failed to meet national standards for year-round particle pollution.",2014-04-30T00:57:04Z,Almost half of Americans live with unhealthy levels of air pollution,,68,Report finds 148m living in areas where smog and soot particles are health risk with climate change likely to worsen conditions,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/4/30/1398819302520/Smoke-from-a-wildfire-in--006.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/30/americans-unhealthy-levels-air-pollution,2,negative
"Air pollution is easily China’s best-recognized environmental challenge. There’s no denying the devastating, nearly incomprehensible levels of smog in Beijing, Shenyang, Shanghai and many other Chinese cities – the pollution is so bad that you can even see it from space.  But pollution is only the beginning of China’s problems resulting from the country’s headlong race into economic development. Take your pick: water pollution, challenges to political and religious freedom, soil pollution, human rights problems, desertification, cancer villages and more. China has only recently begun to take stock of the true costs of its advance into economic powerdom. But intense domestic and international attention to China’s air quality, exemplified by the recent release of the documentary Under the Dome in February, may well be remembered as a tipping point for environmental action in China. Under the Dome, a 100-minute, Inconvenient Truth-style documentary, paints a stark picture of the toll pollution is taking on Chinese people. The film by Chai Jing, which was released online on 28 February, was viewed more than 100m times in the first three days. The Chinese government first praised the film for raising important issues, then abruptly moved to halt coverage or discussion of the film by media outlets in China.    Related: Brazil struggles with drought and pollution as Olympics loom large    But it was too late: the discussion had already started. The first work day after the documentary aired, more than a dozen Chinese clean tech companies saw their stock prices surge, notably electric vehicle manufacturer BYD and pollution monitoring company Sail Hero. While China’s neighbor, Russia, has long had strong environmental protection laws on the books but hasn’t enforced them, China has recently made big strides in strengthening its environmental laws as well as enforcing them.  In January, the country significantly upgraded its Environmental Protection Law, enabling local governments to fine polluters on an ongoing, daily basis until the problems are fixed, and eliminating a cap on those fines. Connecting efforts to eliminate pollution with the operating budgets of local governments has already unleashed a wave of fines – one of McDonald’s French fries suppliers received a record 3.9m yuan ($629,000) fine for water pollution in Shanghai last month – which may deter current or would-be polluters.  The new law also gives activists more power to tackle pollution: for the first time, Chinese NGOs have the right to sue polluters. It’s the latest development in the “war on pollution” announced by premier Li Keqiang last year.     A French fry supplier to McDonald’s in China has been fined Beijing’s biggest-ever pollution penalty for releasing dirty wastewater. Photograph: Andy Wong/AP    Still, lack of follow-through on environmental policies remains one of the biggest obstacles to progress. Take China’s green lending laws, for example. Since 1995, China’s central bank has required financial institutions to place a priority on protecting the environment when choosing which projects to fund. However, a 2012 report from the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection found that only 12% of banks had taken this requirement to heart, and 18% showed no tangible evidence that they had adopted the policy.   Related: Will Panasonic's 'hazard pay' make a difference to air pollution in China?    As the world’s largest country by population, the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and the world’s biggest manufacturer, China has long faced global scrutiny for its social and environmental practices. Chinese manufacturers, in particular, face pressure from Chinese citizens, activists and business leaders, as well as from Western companies trying to improve their supply chains. Perhaps the most influential citizen-led group is the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPEA), founded in 2006 by journalist-turned-environmental advocate Ma Jun. The group’s purpose is to shine a light on pollution in China. By making official pollution data easily available to the public, Ma has made it possible for people to take action in their communities, and has made it nearly impossible for polluters to hide. Among the IPEA’s work is the China Pollution Map, a database that allows users to search for pollution violations by company name, and the Green Choice Alliance, an NGO network that lobbies multinational companies to help reduce pollution from their Chinese suppliers. In recognition of this work, Ma won a 2012 Goldman Prize, as well as a 2015 Skoll Foundation Award for Social Entrepreneurship.  One notable business-led environmental group is the Society of Entrepreneurs and Ecology (SEE), which has become the most prominent funder of environmental groups and projects in the country. SEE was founded in 2004 by some of China’s notable entrepreneurs, including Liu Xiaoguang, the head of the state-owned financial services and real estate firm Beijing Capital Group, and Wang Shi, founder and CEO of Vanke, the world’s largest real estate developer, in response to the rapid desertification of the Tengger Desert in northern China. Financed in part by contributions from each of the 87 founding members, many of them influential Chinese entrepreneurs, SEE has helped to fund a number of autonomous groups across China, including Ma’s IPEA.

Photograph: Qilai Shen     Related: Russia: the unsustainable superpower    The labor and human rights issues China faces are so well-known they have become a cliché: long hours, hazardous working conditions, low wages and limited – or nonexistent – worker protections. But just as it took years for the plight of Chinese laborers to become widely known in the West, the reforms taking place are also speeding ahead of public perception.  Years of work from labor rights advocates including China Labor Watch, the China Collective Bargaining Forum, and the China Labour Bulletin, among many others, have resulted in a workforce that has grown more empowered to demand fair pay and better conditions.  There are innumerable ways in which China casts a shadow, influencing its neighbors andthe entire world. Many of the most obvious ways are negative: water woes, pollution drift, dirty energy. But China has begun what appears to be an about-face on key global environmental issues, and with its size and influence, it also has an opportunity to be a role model for the world – and to spur major changes with its market power. If China grows a domestic market for green products, for instance, suppliers around the world will certainly rush to help fill it.  Last fall, China made a groundbreaking commitment to reach peak emissions no later than 2030, and Beijing has pledged to end its use of coal by 2020. And China has gone much further than simply serving as the manufacturing heart of the global solar boom: the country has for the past three years been setting a blistering pace for new solar installations. In the first quarter of 2015, China installed solar capacity equal to France’s entire output, which in addition to dramatically lowering emissions helps to further build economies of scale in solar manufacturing and expand solar’s reach.  Despite the many benefits of China’s green transition, a potential downside waits in the wings: as Chinese workers successfully improve their livelihoods, one of the most challenging reverberations may be the spread of cheap labor practices to other developing countries.    Related: The BRIC nations' response to climate change is critical to the fate of the planet    Cheap labor and lax regulations may fade away in China, but there are plenty of markets that can help with companies still engaged in the global race to the bottom. In other words, the same forces that brought jobs to China may well send them away. Among the markets emerging for cheap manufacturing labor are Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam and even Myanmar. As low-cost manufacturing shifts away from China, will labor and environmental advocates lose all the progress made in China over the last 15 years and have to begin anew in each of these countries? Or can these new host countries learn lessons from China’s evolution and chart a better course to sustainable development?",2015-05-04T16:57:44Z,"China tackles pollution, but has long way to go on labor","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""c280c2fa8d3469e38a134b4d7cf6392bce5cd33c""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/4/1430750440673/3679642a-1baa-400c-8310-40676a2a1f0e-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Awareness of the dangers of Beijing’s skies is on the rise, thanks to growing data on its air quality.

"China's air pollution could be intensifying storms over the Pacific Ocean and altering weather patterns in North America, according to scientists in the US. A team from Texas, California and Washington state has found that pollution from Asia, much of it arising in China, is leading to more intense cyclones, increased precipitation and more warm air in the mid-Pacific moving towards the north pole.According to the team's findings, which were released on Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, these changes could ultimately contribute to erratic weather in the US.The authors used advanced computer models to study interactions between clouds and fine airborne particles known as aerosols, particularly manmade ones such as those emitted from vehicles and coal-fired power plants.""Our work provides, for the first time to the authors' knowledge, a global multi-scale perspective of the climatic effects of pollution outflows from Asia,"" says the study's abstract.One effect, the study says, is an ""intensification of the Pacific storm track"", a narrow zone over the ocean where some storms that pass over the US begin to gather.""Mid-latitude storms develop off Asia and they track across the Pacific, coming in to the west coast of the US,"" said Ellie Highwood, a climate physicist at the University of Reading. ""The particles in this model are affecting how strong those storms are, how dense the clouds are, and how much rainfall comes out of those storms.""China is fighting to contain the environmental fallout from 30 years of unchecked growth. Of 74 Chinese cities monitored by the central government 71 failed to meet air quality standards, the environmental ministry said last month.China's top leaders are aware of the extent of the problem. Beijing will soon revise an important piece of legislation and give environmental protection authorities the power to shut polluting factories, punish officials and restrict industrial development in some areas, Reuters reported on Tuesday.The changes to the China's environmental protection law, the first since 1989, will legally enshrine oft-repeated government promises to prioritise environmental protection over economic growth.Cao Mingde, a law professor at the China University of Political Science and Law, told the newswire that upholding environmental protection as a fundamental principle was a huge change. ""It emphasises that the environment is a priority.""Although the legislation's fourth draft is nearing completion, it is still short on details, according to the report. China's legal system is often hostile to pollution-related litigation.On Monday, a Chinese court rejected a lawsuit by five residents of Lanzhou, a city in the country's north-west, over an incident last week when dangerous levels of the carcinogenic chemical benzene were detected in the water supply. The residents demanded damages, a public apology and water quality data from the city-owned water company.According to a local newspaper, the court claimed that under civil procedure law, the litigants were unqualified to sue; in pollution-related cases only ""agencies and organisations"" could press charges, and they needed official authorisation to take action.",2014-04-15T14:41:38Z,"China's air pollution leading to more erratic climate for US, say scientists",,70,"<p>Computer modelling showed intensification of US-bound Pacific storms, driven by fine aerosols from coal power plants and traffic</p>",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/15/1397572823149/Smog-in-Beijing-square-20-003.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/15/china-air-pollution-pacific-climate-us-national-academy-sciences,7,neutral
"Panasonic made an announcement this month that it will pay its China-based expatriates a ""hazard pay"" to compensate for the dangerous air quality they're subjected to as they work. The move from the Japanese electronics giant highlights just how bad China's air quality has become. A World Health Organization (WHO) report in March showed that in 2012, seven million people died from air pollution – that's one in eight global deaths – and south-east Asian countries, including China, had the highest burden with 3.3 million premature deaths. The report cites China as hosting the worst air pollution with the most deaths per capita, resulting from indoor and outdoor air pollution. Cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, lung and bladder cancers are some of the resulting illnesses. China's premier, Li Keqiang, and his government have declared a war on pollution with several initiatives in place including shutting down coal-fired furnaces and shifting to different types of development. But responses from corporations like Panasonic, whose green initiatives include donating water pumps, solar lanterns and energy efficient light bulbs to Indonesian villages and other areas with limited electricity, are new and controversial. Meanwhile, eco-friendly products specifically for the China market are also emerging. Will hazard pay help?Will providing expatriate workers a danger pay do much to tackle China's pollution crisis? Panasonic's move is ""a mere drop in the bucket,"" says Usha Haley, professor of international management at West Virginia University and co-author of Subsidies to Chinese Industry. Haley says by offering its expat workers hazard pay, Panasonic has institutionalized what other companies have always offered on the side. ""It is becoming more difficult for American and multinational companies to recruit top talent to work in China due mostly to the perceived costs on health and well-being,"" she says. She adds that China's biggest pollution culprit is coal, supplying two-thirds of the country's energy. ""Our research shows that this problem is not going away."" Haley sees part of the issue being China's role as manufacturing capital for the world. Their calculations show these heavily subsidized, highly inefficient Chinese manufacturing industries including steel, glass, paper and auto parts add 30% of manufacturing capacity each year. ""Something has to give. Experts' calculations of China's air pollution probably underestimate the problem – pollution is a politically threatening issue for the Chinese Communist Party,"" she says.Alan Scheller-Wolf, professor of operations management at the Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, finds Panasonic's hazard pay surprising. The company could just have easily increased pay to employees in China without the hazard pay labeling, he says. ""This could cause potential problems by insulting and shaming China's government to fix the pollution problems, for instance."" Scheller-Wolf wonders whether a policy on hazardous pay mandates compensation, and an employee brought the issue to their attention. Alternatively, Panasonic, which aims to be the world's greenest electronics company by its 100th year anniversary in 2018, may be making a statement to establish ""green"" credibility. ""If so, this is pretty remarkable,"" he says. ""In theory, companies derive benefits from lower costs due to cheap power and lower regulatory burden. Panasonic is essentially publicly calling for higher power costs and increased regulation, which should be counter to their (immediate) cost interests. Of course this would not only affect them; all their competitors would see the same burden."" He suspects the competitive business of China will make other companies match Panasonic's funds, without labeling them hazard pay. More companies will be happy to ""help"" China clean up its air, if money is to be made. Just recently, Europe's largest car maker, Volkswagen, announced plans to produce plug-in hybrid cars across China. Larissa Braun, director of CEO communications for Volkswagen China, says it introduced the Porsche Panamera Plug-In Hybrid in 2013 and plans to introduce its first imported full electric car later this year. Braun says these initiatives are 100% related to helping China with its ongoing pollution problems. Others like Gautam Gandhi, director of new business development for Google India, points out that China's pollution is actually a global problem. Gandhi, (who speaks personally, not on behalf of Google), visited China several times and found the pollution challenging. He adds that India suffers too. In 2010, India's Central Pollution Control Board found particulate matter in the air of 180 Indian cities exceeded WHO's standards by six fold and India has the world's worst asthma rate.

"With a population rapidly approaching that of China crammed into just one third of the area, India suffers from resource scarcity on a level unlike any other nation. So while it nominally faces many of the same challenges as other BRIC nations – water scarcity, dirty energy supplies, human rights issues – India’s population density makes its situation exponentially more difficult. A World Bank study in 2014 found that environmental degradation like air pollution, water pollution, deforestation and natural disasters cost India $80bn per year, or nearly 6% of its economic activity. Of that total, 52% is attributable to air pollution.  If you thought China’s smog was bad, Delhi’s air pollution levels can be twice as high, with even less government action to show for it. India’s air pollution is not only far worse than any of the other BRICs, it is so intense that it is reducing plants’ ability to photosynthesize sunlight, cutting crop yields in half. While pollution is a broad problem across India, poverty and general lack of access to basic human needs is more of a first order problem, and one that draws the lion’s share of attention from government, businesses and people. In 2012, just 36% of India’s population had access to improved sanitation, leading the nation’s minister of rural development to call India “the world’s capital for open defecations”. As a result, much of the sustainable development discussion in India has focused on inclusion and bringing the population into the 21st century. In 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Clean India Mission, a five-year effort to eliminate open defecation, provide access to improved sanitation, and clean up the River Ganges, among other targets. Corporations have joined up with the Clean India Mission, committing to invest in education for girls and adopting communities for cleanup, among others. Domestic and multinational corporations have been important partners for a range of India’s sustainable development efforts, although most of these business efforts tend to be focused locally or regionally.  But in 2013, India became the first country in the world to mandate corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices, with a world-leading corporate law that requires about 8,000 companies in India to invest 2% of its profits per year on CSR programs. The resulting investment could mean as much as $2bn per year will be invested in poverty reduction, environmental and social programs. The law similarly emphasizes that companies invest in areas local to its operations.   Related: The BRIC nations' response to climate change is critical to the fate of the planet    Plenty of debate remains about the current and future impacts of India’s CSR law and whether it will end up being a net good for the nation or simply result in check-the-box CSR practices.  But one aspect of the law stipulates that the investments can not be part of the company’s normal operations, or solely benefit of the company’s employees. This condition could potentially prevent companies from investing in projects with both business and community benefits – such as switching from coal to renewable energy. Even if the CSR law doesn’t spur investment in energy efficiency or green building, some companies are taking that step on their own, and are trying to spread the word about the many business benefits.  Information technology company Infosys pioneered an effort in 2014 to raise the profile of green building technologies among Indian firms. When it undertook an expansion of its campus in Hyderabad, the company built one to traditional standards and one with energy efficiency at its core. The resulting green building, which earned Leed Platinum certification, uses 38% less energy than its counterpart, and cost 1% less to build. Building green as India expands is one example of the leapfrogging potential that all developing economies can benefit from. Rather than using 20th century building practices and then retrofitting for efficiency down the line, building green from the start could enable companies and the country to make more rapid progress towards their sustainability goals. Another big area where India could advance more quickly than the rest of the world is in embracing renewable energy. India is perennially energy-starved – only 75% of the population has reliable access to electricity – and has an eye on its Himalayan neighbors’ bountiful hydropower resources. In one of a number of large-scale Himalayan hydropower projects in the pipeline in Nepal, for instance, Bangalore-based infrastructure firm GMR Group in September signed a $1.4 bn deal to develop a 900-megawatt hydropower project on the upper Karnali River.     Women constructing solar cookers at the Barefoot College in Tilonia, Rajasthan, India. Photograph: Alamy    Unfortunately, negotiating international hydropower deals is a complex endeavor that involves not only energy generation but also access to water among other water-scarce countries downstream such as Bangladesh. As a result, India is also making inroads into solar energy. During the UN climate talks in Lima, Peru, last fall, Modi announced a massive solar commitment: 100 gigawatts of solar capacity by 2022, creating as many as 1m jobs and giving rural Indians access to cheap, clean energy and greater economic opportunity as a result.   Related: China makes strides with environmental reform, but has long way to go on labor    As India’s population continues to grow – a UN report in 2012 projected the country would be the world’s most populous by 2028 – both rural and urban areas will need infrastructure upgrades and new energy generation. As the population urbanizes, cities will expand and newer cities will arise, but existing cities can also be transformed to absorb more residents.  In this way, India has a slight advantage over China when it comes to sustainability: in India’s biggest cities, which predate the rise of the automobile, it may be easier to incorporate forward looking, sustainable mobility infrastructure than in newer cities.  The World Business Council on Sustainable Development’s Sustainable Mobility program works in six cities around the world to create next generation transportation options, and unlike newer, auto-centric cities like Chengdu, China, the Indian city of Indore can’t upgrade its auto infrastructure without knocking down large parts of the city, making the transition to less carbon-intensive transportation options more attractive. Although India is largely occupied with its own domestic problems, there are plenty of countries that live in its shadow. Nepal figures prominently – not only in the wake of last month’s devastating earthquake, but also because of the energy-development partnerships and close cultural ties between India and Nepal. India’s membership in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ties it closely to Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan on economic and social issues, and it also must negotiate water and energy policies among those neighbors. Meanwhile, India is in constant competition with neighboring China and Pakistan. The Modi government has recently taken steps to limit the influence that other countries can have in India, particularly the UK and US. Last month, the Indian government used its Foreign Contributions Regulation Act to freeze Greenpeace’s bank accounts, accusing the nonprofit of encouraging “anti-development protest”. The Ford Foundation was put on a similar watchlist two weeks later.  These moves echo actions against international NGOs taking place in Russia, and could complicate the trajectory of sustainable development in growth-minded India. But if India can find a sustainable path forward, it could certainly play a big role in helping other countries – especially those with densely populated megacities – do the same.",2015-05-04T22:54:18Z,"Can India lead on green buildings, clean energy and corporate sustainability?","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""95b27f0ad541a58065f11d101adcb1f431f019c3""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/4/1430765719312/49a6b57c-b79c-4565-bb56-32e5e0fccac3-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""A migrant laborer carries a bottle of water in the Dwarka sector of New Delhi.

"Councils urged to do more to combat air pollutionLocal authorities should do more to protect people from harmful air pollution, according to the health watchdog Public Health England (PHE).Exposure over a long period of time to air pollution led to over 25,000 deaths in England in 2010, findings show, and PHE has said councils must do more to protect people.Ed Miliband promises devolution to bring prosperity to cities and countiesLabour leader Ed Miliband said that he will give city-regions more power as he promised the ""biggest economic devolution of power"" in a hundred years.Speaking in Birmingham he said that he would give over £4bn a year of Whitehall expenditure to city and county regions.Shadow communities minister Hilary Benn has also spoken about Labour plans to devolve power over infrastructure and skills to councils if they are elected next year.Benn said: ""The government's work programme has so far has not been at all successful in finding work for the long-term unemployed.""The evidence around the country is where local authorities are running schemes to get the long-term unemployed back into work, they are more successful.""LGA concerned by prospect of children's services being run by outside organisationsMembers of the Local Government Association (LGA) have expressed concern at plans that could see children's services no longer provided by councils after it was announced last month that a review of the service would take place.Julian Le Grand, professor at the London School of Economics, will look into options for the service being provided outside of councils.

"Last week smog became the latest immigrant scare: particles from the Sahara and industrial pollution from mainland Europe became the predominant blight damaging life in the capital. So drastic was the level 9 air quality reading from the Met Office, that David Cameron forewent his morning run to do more work instead, claiming that this was a ""naturally occurring weather phenomenon"". Meanwhile, Nick Clegg was quick to add that ""obviously, we can't blame the government"".While the areas worst hit by the smog appeared to be East Anglia and the Midlands, weather maps of central London showed that it was in the most congested urban areas that the worse affects could be measured. In response, agencies, health organisations and politicians warned people to be careful when going outside and to avoid strenuous activity. At the same time, foreboding statistics circulated stating that in the UK 300,000 deaths in the past decade were as a result of air pollution, as well as today's disconcerting news that in the London borough of Kensington, one in 12 deaths are caused by respiratory problems.The lack of any adequate response is not just a government failing, but a general political one: the result of the inability from all major parties to get to grips with a comprehensive, sustainable urban policy. For while the city may be the location of the problem, it is also the only solution.Despite the fug, cities are the greenest possible way to live together and perhaps the only way we can future-proof ourselves against the disasters of climate change. By living close together, sharing resources and reducing our energy usage we can minimise our footprint. In his book, Green Metropolis, David Owen shows that despite New York accounting for 2% of the total American population, it only emits 1% of the US greenhouse gases. A recent study by the British physicist Geoffrey West shows that, when a city doubles in size, it becomes more efficient, increasing its carbon footprint only by 85%.How we build and move around has a huge impact on the quality of life. Housing and transport currently account for 40% of all carbon emissions in the city: much news has been made by cities such as Masdar, designed by Norman Foster on the outskirts of Abu Dhabi and which promises to be carbon-neutral. Similar schemes, such as Tianjin Eco city in China, are so confident in their design, the latest green architecture and infrastructure, that ""the residents will not be expected to make any particular effort to be green"".It is more difficult to retrofit our existing cities to the same standards. Technological innovation is not enough to make that change. For example, Bristol's air quality issues are the result of the postwar road-planning schemes that run through the centre of the city. Mayor George Ferguson has campaigned hard to get the city named as the 2015 European Green Capital, promising a varied programme of improvements that are more than just upgrades to the metropolitan fabric. It is as much a question of changing the life between buildings as it is the buildings themselves.We have to change our behaviour in order to become more sustainable. Initiatives from city hall as well as from the community need to actively engage with each other to make a real difference. The emergency demands action with, rather than to or for, the city. This is a different type of politics that many in city hall see as an obstacle.The most obvious challenge here is getting people out of their cars. Last month the authorities in Paris responded to high pollution levels by banning cars with even numbered number plates. At the same time, public transport was made free of charge for three days. Although the results were obviously disputed by opposition politicians and the car lobby, the ban had an instant effect on air quality. But how do we get people to voluntarily leave their cars at home in the long term?In 1998, Enrique Peñalosa was elected mayor of Bogota in Colombia and started a series of polices that addressed both public transit and social inequality. That year, private cars occupied 64% of all road space but were used by only 19% of the population. As a result, Peñalosa pedestrianised large sections of the city, banned parking on pavements, raised the tax on petrol, and forced commuters to leave their cars at home at least two days a week. One Thursday every year was declared a car-free day. He also revolutionised the bus system so that people would want to leave their cars at home rather that sit in traffic. As he noted: ""Urban transport is a political and not a technical issue. The technical aspects are very simple. The difficult decisions relate to who is going to benefit.""Politicians might blame the weather, but they must surely stand accused of ignoring the rising frustration that results from their complacency.The real question, therefore, is: who has the will to change the city, rather than just the means? It requires a political will, and a concerted effort to engage with citizens to show that changing our behaviour is not just good for the environment but for all of us. Rather than Boris Johnson's unconvincing platitudes that one day London's air would be ""as sweet as the Alps"", we should listen more to the straight-thinking Ferguson, who notes ""this mustn't be just about the centre of the city or the white middle class. In a city that is extremely diverse, it has to engage with all communities.""",2014-04-11T15:30:20Z,Cities bear the brunt of air pollution – they can also solve it,,74,"<strong>Leo Hollis: </strong>Making our cities cleaner is not a technical issue, it's a political one.

"The recent bout of smog in London led to much warranted public outcry and to comparisons being made with Chinese cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. Much was made of the fact that on a particular day, air pollution levels in some parts of London were higher than those in Beijing, a city plagued with air pollution problems.However, while London's smog was of serious concern and something that the government should take measures to prevent, it cannot be compared to the high levels of air pollution that routinely afflict China's big cities. The comparisons were made on what was a good day in Beijing. The levels of around 150 on the Air Quality Index which were experienced in London are an average day for many of China's cities. Upon reading the headlines about the smog in London, some in China scoffed. Even us expatriates, who are used to decent air quality in our home countries, joked that the levels in London are what we would consider jogging weather. This may sound flippant but when you live with consistently bad air, you tend to become somewhat unmoved by it.While the levels of pollution in the UK and China are not comparable, the smog did perhaps give Londoners a glimpse into what it's like to live in a Chinese city. Shanghai is by no means China's most polluted city, in fact it doesn't even make it into the top ten, but the city's residents haven't experienced a ""good"" air day since last October. A ""good"" air reading would be of 50 AQI or less. In general the pollution levels in Shanghai these days lingers between the ""unhealthy for sensitive groups"" to ""unhealthy"" ranges. The weather now has little concern for people, it's the air pollution that everyone talks about. The same way people in other countries check the weather forecast to see if it will rain in case they need to bring an umbrella, we start the day by checking an air pollution smart app to see if we need to wear a face mask. Small talk does not revolve around the weather anymore but instead the air quality. ""The air is good today"" has replaced ""it's a nice day"". Scientific terms relating to pollution such as PM2.5, fine particulate matter that is considered to be dangerous as it lodges deep in the lungs and enters the blood stream, have become part of everyday conversation.Sales of air purifiers, face masks and related products and services have soared as people try to protect themselves and their families. Air purifiers have become a must-have item and a status symbol. Like designer handbags the more expensive the price tag, the more desirable. Face mask companies sell masks with colourful designs and in sizes for children and babies. A baby's important 'firsts' now includes baby's first face mask, something I recently purchased for my nine-month old son but struggle to get him to wear. This winter there have been weeks at a time when, apart from a quick dash into a taxi, he remains indoors breathing air that has been recycled through an air purifier. In Shanghai we tend to console ourselves that, while the air isn't always up to World Health Organisation (WHO) standards, at least it's not as bad as Beijing. However, this winter we experienced our own airpocalypse with the smog reaching hazardous and off the chart levels of over 600 AQI.Air is not something you imagine has a taste but when the pollution levels get that high, it has metallic bitter taste and tickles the back of your throat. Hospitals reported high numbers of patients with respiratory issues. Many friends said they had trouble breathing, itchy skin and headaches. The smog clings to the city like a shroud, giving it a ghostly air. Skyscrapers disappear and people move along the streets like shadows. It's what I imagine Mordor must be like, inhabited by a colony of face mask wearing Darth Vaders. Ironically, the grey soupy sky creates beautiful sunsets.Air pollution is nothing to be scoffed at. It is a very serious health issue, killing as many as seven million people a year. Authorities in the UK and China should take tackling it seriously. There is little doubt that China's bad air now is storing up a host of health problems for it's population into the future.",2014-04-11T10:48:00Z,London's smog crisis was just an average day in many Chinese cities,,75,"<p><strong>Jennifer Duggan:</strong> London's high levels of air pollution made headlines, but cannot be compared to what afflicts Beijing and other cities</p>",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/7/1394217472477/35536f8b-0fec-44af-8682-106752cb46d7-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/chinas-choice/2014/apr/11/london-smog-not-china-airpocalypse-air-pollution,2,negative
"The White House insisted on Sunday it was on strong legal footing as it unveiled details of ambitious carbon reduction plans that are likely to be fiercely opposed by coal-burning Republican states.   Related: Obama to hit US power plants with tougher than expected emissions cuts    Gina McCarthy, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), told reporters the Obama administration’s goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions from US power plants by 32% between 2005 and 2030 kept squarely “within the four corners” of the Clean Air Act. The US supreme court determined in 2007 that this anti-pollution legislation, which was originally aimed at mercury and sulphur emissions, could be used to tackle greenhouse gases too. But the Obama administration’s decision to tackle climate change by introducing new rules through amending pollution regulation rather than an attempt to pass so-called “cap and trade” legislation or implement a carbon tax has been attacked by several states, who plan a series of legal challenges. Similar administration attempts to circumvent opposition in Congress with executive actions on immigration reform have become bogged down in the courts. The 2007 supreme court ruling on the Clean Air Act, however, gives environmentalists hopes that carbon reduction efforts may prove more resilient. Speaking to reporters on Sunday ahead of a formal announcement of the new carbon rule by Barack Obama on Monday, White House adviser Brian Deese said the new EPA rules represented the “biggest step that any single president has made to curb the carbon pollution that is fuelling climate change”. A White House statement said: “Taken together these measures put the United States on track to achieve the president’s near-term target to reduce emissions in the range of 17% below 2005 levels by 2020, and lay a strong foundation to deliver against our long-term target to reduce emissions 26 to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025.” Crucially, the US hopes that leading by example will put it in a stronger position to negotiate international reductions at the Paris climate conference in December and build on bilateral talks with China and Brazil. Later this month, Obama will make trips to Nevada and the Alaskan arctic – the latter the first by a sitting president – to talk up renewable energy investments and the threat from climate change ahead of a US visit by Pope Francis in September. The pope has also backed the moral imperative of carbon-reduction strategies. Details of the US rules, which began emerging over the weekend but were announced formally on Sunday afternoon, confirm slightly higher targets for carbon reduction than were envisaged in draft proposals last year, at a cost of $8.4bn. McCarthy said the higher target was mainly because renewable energy investment and efficiency gains among electricity customers were improving faster than expected. She stressed that the EPA had listened to industry concerns in its decision to allow an extra two years to phase in the new rules and to lower the target for mandatory carbon capture equipment in coal plants. The administration argues that its approach leaves it up to individual states to determine if overall carbon emissions can be best reduced on the demand side, through making existing plants more efficient or by swapping coal generation for renewable sources, nuclear and gas.  “They can cut carbon pollution in whatever way makes sense for them,” said McCarthy. Nonetheless, the administration stuck to its uncompromising position on the overall necessity of the rule change.     Barack Obama is given a tour of solar panels on the roof of the Department of Energy, in Washington in March. Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters     Related: Barack Obama sets sizzling climate action pace in push to leave legacy    “Over the next few days we will hear the same tired old plays from the old special interests playbook,” said McCarthy, who argued “climate change is personal”. Republican candidates to replace Obama in the White House were quick to express their opposition to the move. “President Obama’s carbon rule is irresponsible and overreaching,” said the former Florida governor Jeb Bush, in a statement. “The rule runs over state governments, will throw countless people out of work, and increases everyone’s energy prices.” The Florida senator Marco Rubio followed a similar line. “A lot of what these people are advocating for would hurt our economy badly,” he said. “If you’re a single mom in Tampa, Florida and your electric bill goes up by $30 a month, that is catastrophic.”",2015-08-03T08:29:15Z,White House insists tough new carbon restrictions are legal under Clean Air Act,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""2909f3dd1301f46d4abbc34f502b75f8e2b0c9d9""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/2909f3dd1301f46d4abbc34f502b75f8e2b0c9d9/0_367_5760_3456/1000.jpg"" alt=""US carbon emissions"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Steam billows from the coal-fired Merrimack Station in Bow, New Hampshire.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Jim Cole/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>",77,EPA chief cites 2007 supreme court decision behind ambitious greenhouse gas cuts but Bush and Rubio lead Republican opposition to ‘overreaching’ plan,http://media.guim.co.uk/2909f3dd1301f46d4abbc34f502b75f8e2b0c9d9/0_367_5760_3456/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/02/obama-white-house-emissions-cuts-clean-air-act,5,negative
"  3.29pm BST    Summary    Here&apos;s a summary of today&apos;s events:   Record levels of air pollution have continued to hit the UK. Pollution levels reached level 9 early on Thursday morning in the south-east, Greater London and eastern England, the department for environment, food and rural affairs (Defra) reported on its website. Very high levels of pollution were also forecast later on Thursday for the east midlands.   The government sent out conflicting public health information about what to do in the smog. Defra&apos;s helpline said &quot;everyone is advised to reduce physical exertion particularly outdoor,&quot; in areas where the air pollution is rated as &quot;very high&quot;. But Public Health England said it is only those with heart and lung conditions and old people who should avoid strenuous physical activity.    Alarm about poor air quality turned into a political row after David Cameron said the smog cloud was a &quot;naturally occurring weather phenomenon.&quot; He made light of the problem by saying he had skipped his morning run. The Green party accused him of trying to shirk responsibility for the government&apos;s failure improve air quality.    London mayor Boris Johnson has been urged to impose a series of emergency measures including bans on schools car runs and restrictions on the most polluting vehicles. The call was made by former deputy mayor Jenny Jones who accused Cameron and Johnson of being &quot;bystanders during a public health emergency.&quot;   Some ambulance services have reported an increase in respiratory related call outs. Chemists also said there had been an increase in customers complaining of breathing problems. Amazon reported an increase in face mask sales, and 30% of people with asthma said they had suffered an asthma attack since the smog alerts were issued.    South westerly winds will not bring better conditions until Friday. Rain is forecast to wash away a cloud of Saharan dust coating more cars with a film of sand.        2.58pm BST       The government continues to send out conflicting public health information about what to do in the smog. Defra&apos;s helpline said &quot;everyone is advised to reduce physical exertion particularly outdoor,&quot; in areas where the air pollution is rated as &quot;very high&quot; (see earlier).  But Public Health England said it is only those with heart and lung conditions and old people who should avoid strenuous physical activity.

Electric, hybrid vehicles and those carrying at least 3-4 passengers would be exempt.  Encourage business to avoid peak times journeys and more out of hour deliveries. Along with employees being encouraged to work from home. Partly as a result of working with businesses the 2012 London Olympics were the least polluted of recent times. Sending Mayoral pollution alerts to the 1,148 schools in London that are within 150 metres of roads carrying 10,000 plus vehicles per day and a total of 2,270 schools within 400 metres of such roads. The mayor’s airtext service could be adapted for this purpose. Ban school runs during pollution episodes. Encourage schools in high pollution risk areas with the help of police community officers to enforce school run bans. Alongside more rigorous adherence to school travel plans with information for children and parents to avoid pollution exposure. Regional weather updates should include information about harmful to human health particulate and nitrogen dioxide levels.         2.25pm BST       Dave Throup, the environment agency&apos;s manager for Herefordshire and Worcestershire, warns that more Saharan dust is heading our way. He said rain forecast for Thursday night meant that it would be deposited on England.     Loads more Saharan dust on its way (map for 6pm today) Tonight&#39;s rain likely to deposit much of it on us! pic.twitter.com/ai0LpSSrAf&mdash; Dave Throup (@DaveThroupEA) April 3, 2014         2.20pm BST       Bad air quality is primarily a result of road transport, according to the environment campaign Stephen Tindale. In a blogpost for the Fabian Society, Tindale, who is also Labour activist, writes:   Diesel is worse than petrol for air quality (though less bad for the climate). Diesel engines can be relatively clean if well maintained. But good maintenance is not always a strong point of white van men (or indeed white van women), or of cab drivers. Instead, cars and vans should run on electricity. That would dramatically improve air quality. It could also reduce climate pollution, if the electricity was generated by renewables, nuclear power or fossil fuels with CCS. So central and local government must use all available levers to promote electric vehicles. Buses and HGVs should run on gas. This produces lower greenhouse gas emissions than petrol or diesel, and much lower toxic emissions. All buses in Delhi have to run on gas. Some European cities (including Madrid) use gas buses. Labour local councils should introduce gas buses; though they will be hard pressed to do so because of the deep cuts in grants that the coalition government has made – surprisingly enough – to Labour authorities. Gas buses are cheap to run, but the conversion has to be paid for and infrastructure provided. Nevertheless, gas buses are less expensive than hydrogen buses, which Ken Livingston promoted while London mayor. Together with electric cars, they could clean up Britain’s air dramatically.

Its airpollution campaigner Jenny Bates said:  We can’t just rely on a change of weather or wind direction to tackle the deadly air pollution incidents which regularly hit Britain – strong Government action is needed to tackle the underlying problem too. Ministers, local authorities and the London Mayor must get much tougher on the causes of air pollution – especially traffic fumes. Without urgent action to tackle this national scandal, thousands of people in the UK are likely to die prematurely again this year.

The government&apos;s clean air adviser, Professor Frank Kelly, told the Guardian that all children in polluted areas should be kept in during break time.  Some schools have heeded this advise. But Asthma UK said it should be for individual schools to make their own decisions on what action, if any, they should take. Emily Humphreys, its head of policy and public affairs, said: &quot;Our advice is to make sure every child who has asthma has access to a reliever inhaler. That goes for all the time, but particularly now when there is this additional high level of risk.&quot;  The charity reported that 30% of asthma sufferers have experienced an attack since the poor air quality alerts were issued. Humphreys said: &quot;It does highlight the impact that poor air quality can have on people ... We are keen to see improvements to air quality. But the main focus for us today is dealing with asthma - making sure that people know what to do in an attack and aren&apos;t panicking.&quot;            1.34pm BST       Online retail giant Amazon told my colleague Josh Halliday that it has seen a 15% rise in sales of its face masks.

Daily figures for calls reporting breathing or chest problems were largely level at around 460 on Friday, Saturday and Sunday last week. But the corresponding figures for the first three days of this week were 547, 510 and 501. But hospitals in areas with the highest air pollution reported business as usual, according to PA&apos;s ring round. Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital and Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King&apos;s Lynn said there had been no noticeable impact on admissions.  And Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton, said there had been no increase in admissions.        1.14pm BST       GuardianWitness users continue to share their images and experiences of the smog.

Asthma can be very serious, it takes the lives of three people every day so we want to do everything we can to help people minimise their risk of a potentially life threatening attack.  Debby Waddell, lead nurse at Asthma UK, advised sufferers what to look out for. She said:   We suggest that people keep an eye on their symptoms and know what to do in an asthma attack. You know you’re having an asthma attack if your reliever isn&apos;t helping, your symptoms are getting worse (cough, breathlessness, wheeze or tight chest) or you&apos;re too breathless or it’s difficult to speak, eat or sleep. Children may complain of a tummy ache.        12.22pm BST       The London Ambulance Service saw a 14% rise in 999 calls for patients with breathing problems yesterday, according to PA. The service said it is still experiencing higher volumes of calls for people with breathing difficulties, asthma and heart problems.        12.17pm BST       Before we get too alarmed by the current smog alert it is worth remembering how bad it got in the Great Smog of 1952.

Neil Anderson, a member of the British Lung Foundation’s local ‘Breathe Easy Norwich’ support group, said:   Today in one of our group meetings a number of people were already reporting that they were feeling under the weather, including myself. We couldn’t nail down a particular illness but we were feeling more breathless than usual. This made a lot more sense today when I found out that pollution levels had been on the increase.  The medical advice is that it can take a while for pollution to have an impact a person’s health – so if this was what we were feeling like yesterday when the pollution wasn’t as bad, I’m worried about what the impact it will be later in the week, once the impact of today has really taken hold. Already we’re worried to go outside the house.  I usually feel much better on warmer days like yesterday so I was quite worried when I didn’t feel well. My feeling is that pollution levels in general in the area have gone down in the last few years, but those periods when levels rise, like today, still have an effect. And you can’t just blame them on the winds coming in from Africa. We need to do more to stop the fumes coming out of lorries and buses – that’s what’s doing the real damage. Until we stop it, people will keep getting ill.      Updated at 11.35am BST     10.13am BST       Deputy prime minister appears to be taking the smog problem more seriously than his coalition partner, writes Peter Walker.  Nick Clegg was asked about the smog on his weekly LBC radio phone in, Call Clegg. Slightly oddly, his co-host Nick Ferrari introduced the issue with the caveat, “Obviously, we can’t blame the government for this,” something others might disagree with. Clegg said his youngest son, Miguel, had been up much of the night coughing, though he did not know if this was smog-related. He said: “I think one needs to be a bit careful, particularly with the very young, the very old. Listen carefully to what the heath professionals say.” “I was walking the kids to school yesterday and showing them this brown film on the cars. My youngest boy, as it happens, was up most of the night coughing, which is why I probably look a bit bleary-eyed. I don’t know whether that’s associated with it.”      Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg listens to a question from a listener, during an LBC radio phone-in programme with host Nick Ferrari. Photograph: John Stillwell/PA         10.09am BST       The Green Party has accused David Cameron of trying to shirk responsibility for the smog by blaming the problem on natural causes.  In his interview with BBC Breakfast the prime minister described the smog as a &quot;naturally occurring weather phenomenon&quot;.  The comment was seized on Keith Taylor, a Green MEP for south east England who said Cameron&apos;s &quot;flippant&quot; remark was &quot;utterly disgraceful&quot;. He said:   In the last 10 years nearly 300,000 people have died because of air pollution in the UK, that’s the equivalent of a city the size of Newcastle. Yet, despite the ongoing threat of air pollution and the fact that the EU is taking legal proceedings against the UK on this issue, the Prime Minister has the audacity to lay the entire blame for the smog on Saharan dust. We know that the dust was a contributing factor, and one which we have no control over. But the Government also know that 80 people die every day in the UK because of air pollution, and that we simply aren’t doing enough to tackle the smog coming from our cars and factories. The Prime Minister’s flippant response to this invisible killer is utterly disgraceful. Officials from his own Government are saying that local air pollution is part of the reason for the smog we’re breathing in, yet he’s blaming it all on Saharan Dust. The reason the EU is taking legal action against the UK is that the government simply isn’t doing enough to tackle the problem. We need urgent action on air pollution. That means cutting down the diesel fumes in our towns and cities, and investing in clean, affordable public transport options. David Cameron needs to stop shirking responsibility and start taking action now on air pollution. To wilfully ignore this threat to our health is unforgivable.        9.21am BST       The areas worst hit so far by pollution are the south-east and London, according to the latest data from a 130 monitoring sites released by Defra.  &quot;Very high&quot; levels were recorded in both regions.

A little bit of #desert in #leamington this morning pic.twitter.com/hma9qQepM0&mdash; John Curtin (@johncurtinEA) April 3, 2014    Air pollution from vehicles, factories and homes is now so bad, that when it is exacerbated by a storm in the Sahara 2,500 miles away, or by high pressure over northern Europe, it can leave millions gasping, their skin itching and eyes watering, experts told Ian Sample and John Vidal.   When, as has happened this week, all three factors coincide, the outcome is a &quot;perfect storm&quot; for air pollution, says Helen Dacre, a meteorologist at Reading University. First, emissions from British traffic and industry have steadily built up in the air. Then gentle easterly winds have brought more pollution from the industrial centres of continental Europe. To make matters worse the dust that has blown in from the Sahara has been whipped up by a storm that produced gale force winds in north Africa. The pollution seen in the milky white air that has blotted out the sun and shrouded half of Britain for much of the past few days, is mostly made up of tiny particulates, such as nitrates and sulphates, mixed with fine desert dust. The particulates come from partially complete combustion processes, but diesel engines are a big culprit, and wear and tear from brake pads and tyres, as well as construction sites, all add to the problem. Saharan dust is blown in all directions. Much is dumped in the seas. But several times a year strong southerly winds bring dust clouds as far north as Britain, mostly during spells of dry weather in Europe, which stops the dust being washed out by rain along the way. The size of particulates is directly linked to their potential to cause health problems. The smallest particulates, those less than 2.5 micrometres, called PM2.5s, are the most dangerous because they penetrate deep inside lungs. Long-term exposure to particles is linked to higher levels of fatal heart and lung disease, including lung cancer.        8.39am BST       It is not just England that is being hit by smog.

Politics Homes quoted the prime minister telling BBC Breakfast: “It&apos;s unpleasant and you can feel it in the air...I didn&apos;t go for my morning run this morning&quot;   Schools in areas affected by severe air pollution should keep pupils indoors at lunchtime to avoid them having asthma attacks and potentially lifelong lung damage, a key government adviser is urging. Prof Frank Kelly said children should be stopped from using the playground during school hours to reduce their exposure to the smog that is affecting south-east England and is expected to spread to the Midlands and East Anglia.   Government advisers are putting out conflicting messages about the health risks, according to the Telegraph. It said Public Health England admitted that the “vast majority of people” would feel no effects and independent experts said there was “no need” to stay indoors. And that a similar alert was put out three weeks ago, when pollution levels were higher in London than on Wednesday. Defra has summarised the government&apos;s advice in a table.

On Tuesday the Met Office forecast that there would be high or very high levels of air pollution across southern England and the Midlands yesterday.However, results from 130 monitoring sites showed that it remained low or moderate for most of the day over most of the country.   Air pollution is the world&apos;s single biggest environmental health risk and yet it is being played down by UK authorities, according to the Guardian&apos;s environment editor John Vidal.   Don&apos;t expect ministers to admit this is a public health emergency. And certainly don&apos;t expect local or central government to take action, such as reducing car numbers in the streets or closing down factories. That&apos;s what the Chinese and French governments do when the air in their cities is unbreathable and their people are choking. Not us.

"The high air pollution across central and southern England and parts of Wales is due to light easterly winds bringing pollutants from the continent and allowing local pollution to linger close to where it is produced.Dust blown up from the Sahara may also be a factor, according to Defra. Bernd Heinold, who models Saharan dust clouds at the Leipzig Institute for Tropical Research in Germany, said the dust was often carried into the oceans to the east and west of Africa, but around three times a year it was carried north by strong winds over the Sahara.If the dust rises high enough in the atmosphere and does not meet a low pressure weather system on the way, the particles can reach the UK before falling to the ground. Winds of more than 20mph are usually needed to sweep sand up into the atmosphere, and over the Saharan desert they have been reaching 40mph in recent weeks.In high enough densities, the dust clouds can make the sky look bright white, and give sunsets a yellow tinge as the particles refract light from the sun.The highest levels of pollution in the UK on Wednesday were south of the Wash and east of a line from Cheshire to east Devon.Health officials said adults and children with lung problems and adults with heart problems should cut down on strenuous exercise, particularly outdoors, especially if they experienced any symptoms. People with asthma were told they may need to use their inhalers more often. Officials advised older people in general to reduce physical exertion until the air pollution clears.Dr Sotiris Vardoulakis, head of the air pollution and climate change group at Public Health England's Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, said: ""While most people will not be affected by short-term peaks in air pollution, some individuals, particularly vulnerable groups such as those with existing heart or lung conditions, may experience increased symptoms.""Around one in 50 heart attacks that lead to admissions at London hospitals may be triggered by air pollution, according to a study at St George's hospital in Tooting. Researchers there compared emergency admissions for heart problems with air pollution the day before. Particulates in the air pollution are thought to cause inflammation that exacerbate underlying disease.The air pollution levels will stay high on Thursday. Most affected will be East Anglia, the Midlands including Lincolnshire, and eastern parts of Wales, through to the Wirral and the north coast of Wales. The north-west coast of England, south-west Scotland and the north-east of Northern Ireland will also see high air pollution. The levels will fall on Friday, as south-westerly winds bring cleaner air to much of the UK.Frank Kelly, professor of environmental health at King's College London, said: ""This air pollution episode follows quickly on the heels of the previous episode which affected most of Europe and led to restricted car use and free public transport in Brussels and Paris.""Periods of very high pollution in London arise usually because the city's normal pollution emissions are increased further by polluted air arriving on light winds from neighbouring areas such as northern Europe.""However, whether home-produced or arriving from the continent, the tiny particles we take into our bodies with each breath cause immediate problems for some individuals such as those with asthma and contribute to longer-term problems for most of us in the form of heart disease and stroke.""",2014-04-02T10:41:59Z,What is causing the UK's high levels of air pollution?,,80,Pollution originating in the UK and Europe has combined with dust from the Sahara to create particularly unhealthy conditions,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/2/1396435263881/Haze-from-the-effect-of-h-006.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/02/what-causing-uk-high-level-air-pollution,1,negative
" Race for the Water, a Swiss marine research expedition focused on plastic pollution, last week announced its plan to collect and analyze samples of plastic found on the world’s most remote island beaches. Over a trip of 40,000 nautical miles, the crew will use drones to conduct its work. Those drones will fly over beaches to collect information on how much plastic has collected there. In the coming year, the team hopes to collect information that could stem the flow of plastic debris into the world’s oceans. By creating a repeatable research protocol, it hopes to address three research needs laid out by the Honolulu Strategy, an international framework for addressing global marine plastic pollution adopted in 2010 by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the United Nations. These include: standardized research protocols for marine debris, repeatable and comparable studies, and data-based solutions.   Related: Landscapes we don’t want to lose: tell your story of living with climate change    The use of drones could be helpful for NOAA, according to Nancy Wallace, the director of the agency’s marine debris program. Wallace says she needs a time-lapse look of micro debris on the beaches and that right now the only way to get it is to have people comb beaches and count – a costly and time-consuming affair. Sending drones to perform the task instead would save time and money, in addition to providing more data.  Funded primarily by Marco Simeoni, a Swiss entrepreneur turned environmental crusader, Race for the Water is also determined to inject a spirit of adventure into an otherwise depressing issue. “We say OK, this is a problem we have to solve together, let’s make it an adventure,” Servan-Shcreiber says. “It’s about being human and facing problems together. That’s why we like [our] boat.”  The boat is a racing catamaran that Servan-Schreiber describes as “incredibly uncomfortable,” with no toilet onboard, no lighting in the hallways, two bunk beds for six people, and only two small gas burners for preparing food. It’s not a logical choice for such an expedition, but that’s the point. “These guys have to wear mining lights on their heads to walk down the hallway, and Marco never believed the boat could make it around the world – he gets sea sick on it constantly, but he’s sticking with it,” Servan-Schreiber says. “These guys are really gladiators for the environment, and the expedition is a great human story.”     The Race for Water Odyssey is a racing catamaran that Servan-Schreiber describes as “incredibly uncomfortable,” with no toilet onboard, no lighting in the hallways, two bunk beds for six people. Photograph: Race for the Water    Beaches versus blue water  While several groups have taken to the seas to both raise awareness and gather information about plastic pollution – including 5 Gyres, Project Kaisei, Plastiki, Algalita and the Clean Oceans Project – one of the issues spotlighted in the Honolulu Strategy is the fact that each research expedition tends to employ different protocols, and there is often quite a bit of time between samples taken, which makes it difficult to both compare the results of various studies, and to replicate the results of any one study.    Related: Ocean plastic is likely disappearing into the food chain, new study indicates    In some ways, that inconsistency is just the nature of the beast, or rather, the ocean. In addition to the fact that each expedition needs to find funding – for tools, boats, staff, and laboratory analysis – most have also focused on collecting samples from the open ocean, which is challenging, especially when weather and currents don’t cooperate. 5 Gyres has run more expeditions more frequently than most organizations, and has documented the presence of approximately 268,000 tons of plastic in all five of the world’s ocean gyres (large circular networks of ocean currents), and maintains an updated map of global plastic pollution. Still, co-founder and research director Marcus Eriksen says he’s had challenges over the years collecting data on various boats in every ocean condition imaginable. By focusing on beaches rather than the open water, and using the drones to go back frequently and map changes over time, Servan-Schreiber hopes Race for the Water may be able to close the research gap. “We think going to the islands gives us a very good way to study the five gyres without having to do the same as everybody else and get samples from blue water,” he says. “We think what we find on the beach, we’ll find in the water. And the good thing about the islands is that we can come back again and again and get a sense over time of how the problem is evolving.”     The Race for Water Odyssey arriving in New York City. Photograph: Peter Charaf/Race for the Water    Finding solutions  The team plans to send samples to a lab in Lausanne, Switzerland – Race for the Water’s home base – to determine which chemicals have accumulated in the plastic and at what levels. The fact that plastic in the ocean attracts and accumulates chemicals is well established, but the Lausanne lab will attempt to pinpoint how this process happens over time, and what level of chemical toxicity should be expected in the world’s oceans over time. That’s important because fish and birds consume microplastics, which can poison not only the animals, but also the humans who eat them.  It’s even a concern for people who might consider themselves fairly removed from the ocean ecosystem, Servan-Schreiber explains. “This week I’m in Miami and last week I was in Rio, and every beach I go to, all over the world, there are tiny bits of plastic in the sand,” he says. “And yet kids are playing on it and it’s shocking, in a way, that we are letting kids play on beaches that are actually contaminated.” Over time, plastic on beaches could potentially leech not only the chemicals used to make the plastic in the first place, but also any additional chemicals accumulated in the ocean. While short term exposure has not indicated any health issues related to ocean plastic, Servan-Schreiber points out that we don’t know what long term exposure may do.    Related: 'The world is finally producing renewable energy at an industrial scale'    Servan-Schreiber says the team rejected the idea of recycling the plastic they collect because recycling marine plastic pollution requires a lot of fresh water to clean off the salt, making it inefficient and wasteful. Instead, the team is focusing its energy on identifying large-scale solutions. Cigarette butts, for example, are coated in plastic and thus never break down – they make up more than 40% of the debris found on beaches. “So maybe that’s an argument for e-cigarettes,” Servan-Schreiber says. Plastic bottle caps are another issue. Although beverage bottles are ubiquitous, their caps tend to be a bigger issue because they are colorful and just the right size for birds, fish, and marine mammals to eat. So the Race for the Water team is looking at whether a new sort of top could be designed for plastic bottles.  They are also finding inspiration at home in Lausanne, where a factory in the middle of the city burns plastic debris to generate energy. The factory is equipped with a filter that keeps any related toxins out of the air. “We have to find ways to make value out of marine debris,” Servan-Schreiber says. “It could sound good to recycle it, but it isn’t. Once we looked at it, turned out burning it to create electricity and heat is probably the best option. But that’s just one of the ideas out of this, and we’re just at the beginning.” Ultimately, the goal is to find viable solutions and put as many of them in place as possible. “Because plastic never goes away, at some point, the beaches will be more plastic than sand,” Servan-Schreiber says. “So it’s better to realize that very early and try to mitigate the problem.”",2015-04-23T14:54:24Z,A round-the-world scientific expedition will use drones to study plastic pollution,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""6ff790ea6e94744dca2070dd2dcd76482071d34e""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/6ff790ea6e94744dca2070dd2dcd76482071d34e/0_46_700_420/500.jpg"" alt=""The Race for Water Odyssey is on a journey that will take its crew over 40,000 nautical miles as they attempt to draw up the first global assessment of plastic pollution in the oceans."" width=""500"" height=""300"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The Race for Water Odyssey is on a journey that will take its crew over 40,000 nautical miles as they attempt to draw up the first global assessment of plastic pollution in the oceans.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Peter Charaf/Race for the Water</span> </figcaption> </figure>",81,Scientists circumnavigating the globe on a spartan racing catamaran will spend the coming year deploying drones to collect better data on plastic pollution,http://media.guim.co.uk/6ff790ea6e94744dca2070dd2dcd76482071d34e/0_46_700_420/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/vital-signs/2015/apr/23/plastic-pollution-drones-noaa-un-honolulu-strategy-marco-simeoni,3,negative
"Caroline Lucas was standing for parliament the last time we met, and this time round she's standing trial. As far as I&nbsp;can establish, she's the first sitting MP to be prosecuted over a matter of principle since a Labour member refused to pay the poll tax 25 years ago – and she hasn't even been in the Commons for a full term yet. But her reason for risking arrest is exactly the same as the reason she ran for election: she is frightened that we're heading for environmental Armageddon. It's not exactly a reason to be cheerful – and we meet in her Brighton constituency this week just as air pollution began swaddling the country, only hours after the latest IPCC report warned that climate change is already wreaking havoc on the planet, causing heatwaves and floods. But if she was relentlessly cheerful last time round, this time she's practically Pollyannaish.Lucas must wait until 17 April for her trial to conclude, when she will discover whether magistrates find her guilty or not of causing an obstruction during an&nbsp;anti-fracking protest last summer in&nbsp;Balcombe – so there are some legal constraints on what she can say now.But the more striking constraints are political, and she's stuck with them, regardless of the verdict. As the country's first Green party MP, Lucas cannot afford to say that voters will have&nbsp;to forego some luxuries to combat climate change, because turkeys don't vote for Christmas. She can't acknowledge that Brighton's Green-led council may well have muffed up her re-election chances by making some howlingly unpopular mistakes. ""Um, it's maybe made it a bit more challenging."" She can't risk telling us bluntly that we're losing the fight against climate change, because then everyone would give up trying. And for obvious reasons, she can't say she was glad that so many of us spent the winter under water. ""But I can say that I hope it will have been a wake-up call."" What Lucas has to be is resolutely optimistic – and she is, doggedly, with a sort of heroic determination.Why she is on trial is still a puzzle to Lucas. She and other protesters had been sitting on a small off-road driveway in Balcombe for five hours last August, and were talking about leaving, when the police decided to arrest them. ""Another 15 minutes and we'd probably all have been gone."" So she is angry about that, but glad to be on trial, ""to the extent that the coverage can be about fracking. I was pleased about the protest overall, in the sense that it did put the spotlight again on fracking. If&nbsp;you look at opinion polls before and&nbsp;after that summer of protest, the numbers against fracking were much higher by the end, so I think it really raised awareness."" A local councillor told her that when the planning permission for Cuadrilla first went through in&nbsp;Balcombe, they didn't really know what fracking was, ""And it felt really important to make sure that could&nbsp;never&nbsp;be a reason again.""For Lucas, the big problem with fracking has nothing to do with the risk&nbsp;that it will cause earthquakes, contaminate the water table or pollute the soil. In fact, she thinks it possible that stringent regulations could minimise those risks. ""It's not that fracking itself is necessarily worse than ordinary gas extraction. It's the fact that&nbsp;we're just about to put into place a&nbsp;whole new infrastructure for a whole new fossil-fuel industry, at exactly the time when we need to be reducing our emissions."" The problem, in other words, is climate change.Some environmentalists argue that shale gas is the obvious answer to our energy needs, until we've worked out how to power the country with renewables. Lucas accepts that we do need gas&nbsp;to tide us over, ""but I would prefer to keep importing it from Norway, for example, because it will be easier to turn&nbsp;that tap off than it would be to dismantle an entire new industry that we had deliberately incentivised. That's&nbsp;why Balcombe felt so important, because it is literally on the frontline.""Caroline Lucas will discover later this month whether magistrates find her guilty or not of causing an obstruction during an anti-fracking protest in Balcombe last summer. Photograph: Dave Evans/CorbisIt is a total myth, she insists, that fracking shale gas would bring down our&nbsp;energy prices. It has in the US, but she says any shale gas fracked in the UK would have no impact on our heating bills, and wouldn't even be used in this country, because we are locked into European energy prices. ""What will reduce prices is a significant investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Just exactly as the&nbsp;price of gas is going up, the price of renewables is coming down, and that's why there is such a fierce battle going on in places like the department of energy. I&nbsp;don't think we should be naive about this. There is a massive battle of vested interests going on, because the fossil fuel companies can see the writing on the wall – they can see that quite soon those renewable sources are going to be cheaper, and that is why we've had such a fightback from the nuclear industry, and such a fightback from companies like Cuadrilla, who absolutely don't want to see that.""When anyone talks about renewable energy I confess my spirits sag. The government's much-hyped Green Deal has been a disappointment for most homeowners, who did the sums and decided they couldn't afford to make their homes more environmentally friendly after all. I'm one of them, and had got the impression that&nbsp;renewables were proving trickier to&nbsp;develop than hoped. This&nbsp;week it emerged that David Cameron wants to stop any more onshore wind farms being built, and may even pledge to dismantle some in&nbsp;next year's manifesto. Many Tory voters may conclude that if even a&nbsp;government this committed to renewable energy can't make it work, then clearly it's just not possible?""There is just such a cognitive dissonance – I suppose hypocrisy is&nbsp;a&nbsp;better way of putting it – between what the government says, and what it&nbsp;does. What evidence do you have, beyond&nbsp;the rhetoric, that David Cameron is remotely interested in the green agenda? He's got Owen Paterson as his environment secretary, for heavens' sake, who doesn't even think that climate change is a problem! Everyone can look back on David Cameron hugging a husky and see it for&nbsp;the photo opportunity that it was. It&nbsp;was&nbsp;a very clever way of detoxifying the Tory brand&nbsp;at the time. To talk about closing wind farms in this of all weeks, the very week of the IPPC report, I think shows the Tories in their true colours, and just shows that 'Vote blue, get green' meant nothing. The government seems to have an ideological opposition to renewable energy.""Even more revealing, Lucas thinks, is the news this week that the government intends to alter the law of trespass, to allow shale gas to be fracked underneath private land even without the owner's permission. ""The government obviously feels that it is not going to be able to win the argument, so it's going to take away people's right to decide what happens under their own homes. And this was a&nbsp;government that came to power championing localism!""How does she explain it? ""The only answer I have is that the fossil&nbsp;fuel companies have a direct line to government."" More than 50 energy company employees have been seconded to the government free of charge, and dozens of them to the department of energy and climate change. ""They're not doing that out of the goodness of their hearts. They're doing it because they want to shape the kind of policy that comes out of it – and frankly they're&nbsp;doing a rather good job. I cannot come up with another answer for why government would look evidence in the&nbsp;face and turn its back on it.""When the evidence on climate change is as bleak as it looks in the latest IPCC report, Lucas doesn't blame the public for wanting to look away in despair. We've been reading IPCC reports for quarter of a century – and she admits that ""essentially it's been the same story&nbsp;for 25 years. Increasingly, we are&nbsp;recognising that the science is not what's going to move this. To me the really interesting thing about climate change right now is less about the science and much more about psychology. I think the green movement has learned the hard way that handing out small print leaflets saying 'If we don't change soon then we're all doomed' is not an&nbsp;effective way of getting people to change. So I think there's a much greater&nbsp;emphasis now within the Green party and the green movement about talking about the positives.""Her favourite cartoon shows a lecturer giving a presentation about what a low-emissions society would look like – sustainability, more livable cities, cleaner air, healthier kids etc – and an audience member asking, 'But what if&nbsp;climate change is a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing?' ""I'm a&nbsp;great believer in needing things that give us some hope,"" Lucas smiles. ""With&nbsp;a positive vision of the benefits then I&nbsp;think we'll have a much better chance of bringing people with us.""She is probably right. But the imperative of positivity makes it hard to know exactly what she thinks. She smiles an awful lot, but would have to be a saint to&nbsp;feel this permanently cheerful in private, so I try to guess how she really feels by timing the pauses that often preface her smiley answers. After four years in parliament, I ask if she feels more or less optimistic that politicians will do what is necessary to combat climate change – and I count more than six seconds of silence before her reply.""I suppose I get a sense that we can build coalitions, and that with enough political will, things can change. That's been quite interesting to see up-front."" There has been some great collaborative work between her party and the trade unions, she goes on hopefully. But when pressed, it transpires that Ed Miliband has had a grand total of two meetings with Lucas since she was elected – and Cameron has not spoken to her once. She has been staggered by the lack of legislative scrutiny in Westminster, and by the stunning inefficiency of the entire system. ""Parliamentary reform has gone right up my list of priorities,"" she grins. For 12 years before her election to the Commons, Lucas was an MEP, ""and I&nbsp;never thought I would say this, but in some respects the European parliament is more efficient than Westminster"".She must have had moments when she's questioned the point of her being there at all. ""Um … No, I haven't thought that, because it's so important that the Greens have a place. We've had much more coverage, it's been an amplifier. And I can take a position that helps shift the other parties. I see my role very much as being there to hold their feet to&nbsp;the fire. It feels important, and that matters. I didn't do this because I&nbsp;thought it was fun,"" she smiles, ""but because I thought it was important.""The funny thing is, Lucas reflects, smiling again, that she has been trying for years to work out where the real power lies: ""And it always seems to be where I'm not."" She didn't find it on Oxfordshire county council in the 90s, nor in Strasbourg, nor now in Westminster. She feels hopeful about her party's prospects in next month's European elections, and urges any supporters worried about wasting their vote in next year's election to remember that if everyone in Brighton had done the same, her party still wouldn't have a&nbsp;single MP. But she also recalls something Miliband said when he was climate change minister. ""There he was, the minister – which you would have thought made him influential – appealing for NGOs to organise a&nbsp;campaign that would give him permission to mobilise in government.""Does she mean she might well have been more powerful sitting down on the pathway in Balcombe than she can be on the House of Commons benches? Sometimes I wish Lucas would be a bit less cautiously cheerful, and just let rip about what's wrong with our political system. But after a few seconds' pause she says. ""No, no, I think the two are complementary.""",2014-04-04T15:32:05Z,Caroline Lucas: 'I didn't do this because I thought it was fun',,82,"The UK's first Green MP has plenty to be concerned about – choking air pollution, the IPCC's climate-change warnings, scant progress on renewable energy, and her trial after the Balcombe anti-fracking protest – but she's positively Pollyannaish, finds <strong>Decca Aitkenhead</strong>",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/4/1396608800695/Caroline-Lucas-006.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/04/caroline-lucas-interview-anti-fracking-balcombe-climate-change-air-pollution,2,positive
"Diesel, not just dust, has helped create this smog - John Vidal and Ian Sample  Air pollution from vehicles, factories and homes is now so bad, regularly, in Britain that when it is exacerbated by a storm in the Sahara 2,500 miles away, or by high pressure over northern Europe, it can leave millions gasping, their skin itching and eyes watering  What should businesses and government be doing? We want to hear what action you think businesses and government should be taking in light of the record levels of air pollution over Britain this week.  To get us started, a recent report by transport and sustainability expert, Malcolm Fergusson, proposed car clubs as one of the answers to London&apos;s air quality, which is the worst among European capitals. Fergusson claimed that for every car-club car that&apos;s introduced, 14 individual cars are taken off the roads. London mayor, Boris Johnson, plans to tackle the city&apos;s poor air quality with an electric car rental scheme Autolib. Inspired by its successful three year trial in Paris, cars can be borrowed for as little as £5 for 30 minutes and paid for using phones or smartcards. While e-cars aren&apos;t currently considered the sexiest, it&apos;s hoped that the rise of Formula E with famous team owners like Leonardo DiCaprio and Richard Branson, could help its case.       Inspiration from elsewhere In March, the French government ordered 700 police onto the streets from dawn to ensure that only cars and motorbikes with odd-numbered plates were being driven. By the afternoon, 3,859 drivers with even-numbered plates had been issued with a €22 (£18) fine. The ban was stopped after 24 hours when pollution levels were said to have returned to a safe level.       Beijing has started restricting half of the cars on the roads each day, and has reduced new licence plates for petrol and diesel cars from 240,000 to 150,000 this year.     A woman wearing a protective mask rides along an overpass near heavy traffic during a polluted day in Beijing Sunday 6 October, 2013. Photograph: AP    A lethal scandal of British inaction - John Vidal London however, hasn&apos;t taken such measures.  ... if you are in government please don&apos;t mention the fact that the toxic air much of Britain has been breathing is mostly of our own making.   Don&apos;t look on the front page of Defra&apos;s website for an explanation of its composition, or expect ministers to admit this is a public health emergency. And certainly don&apos;t expect local or central government to take action, such as reducing car numbers in the streets or closing down factories. That&apos;s what the Chinese and French governments do when the air in their cities is unbreathable and their people are choking. Not us.  Comment from Friends of the Earth Friends of the Earth air pollution campaigner Jenny Bates has said:  We can’t just rely on a change of weather or wind direction to tackle the deadly air pollution incidents which regularly hit Britain – strong government action is needed to tackle the underlying problem too. Ministers, local authorities and the London Mayor must get much tougher on the causes of air pollution – especially traffic fumes. Without urgent action to tackle this national scandal, thousands of people in the UK are likely to die prematurely again this year.

""To wilfully ignore this threat to our health is unforgivable,"" he said.Amazon said sales of face masks were up 15% compared with last week. The British Lung Foundation said there had been a 16% increase in calls to its helpline and was braced for a further surge over the coming days.Sand from the Sahara, gases from the continent and domestic pollution have created the thick blanket of smog across large parts of Britain.On Thursday morning, air pollution levels were very high in Greater London and the south-east, and high in East Anglia, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said.Very high levels were forecast for the East Midlands, and moderate levels – measuring six on the 10-point scale – were expected in the north-west, northern Wales and some coastal areas of north-east England and south-east Scotland.Defra said England and Wales would experience moderate or low levels of pollution on Friday as cleaner south-westerly winds swept north and east. Low levels are expected across Scotland and Northern Ireland.Neil Anderson, 50, who attends a British Lung Foundation support group in Norwich, said he was feeling more breathless and under the weather on Thursday than on Wednesday as a result of the smog.He said: ""The medical advice is that it can take a while for pollution to have an impact on a person's health, so if this was what we were feeling like earlier in the week when the pollution wasn't as bad, I'm worried about what the impact will be later in the week once the impact of the pollution has really taken hold.

It said: ""At very high pollution levels everyone is advised to reduce physical exertion, particularly outdoors, especially if you experience symptoms such as a cough or sore throat.""West Midlands ambulance trust received 1,558 calls from people suffering breathing difficulties between Monday and Wednesday, up from 1,404 in the previous three days.The East of England ambulance trust had a 6% spike in calls.

"Air pollution is a killer, more of a killer than obesity or passive smoking before the smoking ban. It kills indirectly, through heart attacks, lung infections and cancers. No one questions its devastating impact – here, it is estimated to cause 29,000 early deaths per year – yet, like much of the rest of Europe, the UK is falling well short of EU pollution reduction targets and, on its current trajectory, they won't be reached in London for another 10 years. The smog that has built up across towns and cities in eastern England over the last fortnight is the result. And it will get worse.It is not only home-produced pollutants that are to blame. Along with the Saharan dust, a weather system is bringing in polluting gases from across the Channel. Pollution is even worse in Paris, but there the administration (fleetingly) introduced restrictions on traffic which alerted people to the problem. In Brussels, warnings have been going out for weeks. Only here has there been virtually no discussion of it, until it reached the extreme levels of the past few days.Cutting the amount of ambient air pollution – the concentration of gases like nitrous and sulphuric oxides, and diesel particulates – is not easy. Although air pollution comes from industry and agriculture as well as traffic, in cities it is diesel engines that do most damage. There is a technology that reduces emissions, but it cannot be retro-fitted, and because the EU target relates to concentrates rather than emissions, there has not been enough of an incentive to drive the change. Faced with the failure of its concentration targets, the European commission is changing strategy to concentrate on reducing emissions. It is also launching cases against the worst offending countries. The UK is top of the list for excessive concentrates of nitrous dioxide and, if it still fails to conform, may face multi-million pound fines. That is not the only pressure on the government. A year ago, the law firm ClientEarth successfully challenged the UK on its breach of the EU air quality directive. As a result, later this year, the European court of justice will rule on how it should be enforced. The decision of the court will shape policy across the EU.Clean air campaigners say the failure to get to grips with pollution is one of the biggest public health failures in modern history. The cross-party environmental audit committee says the government should be ""ashamed"" of its record. And the World Health Organisation warns that air pollution – now the biggest global killer – has serious health consequences, even at levels below the EU clean air directive. Professor Frank Kelly, who is the government's clean air adviser, says children at school in polluted areas should be kept in at break-time.  This is becoming a national crisis. It should not be allowed to happen again.",2014-04-02T23:14:39Z,Air pollution: breathtaking,,85,"<strong>Editorial:</strong> Like much of Europe, the UK is falling short of EU pollution reduction targets and is unlikely to meet them in next 10 years",,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/03/air-pollution-breathtaking-editorial,0,negative
"Since the US Clean Air Act’s passage in the 1970s, there have been a steady stream of reports correlating exposure to air pollutants with a variety of health impacts. But in the early days, much of that information was too rudimentary to be of much use. Monitoring technology has improved in the decades since, and state air-quality boards have amassed volumes of actionable data about air pollution. The increase in available data coupled with advances in chemistry and 3D modeling over the past few years has enabled scientists to identify new particle systems within air pollution. Researchers are now able to determine all the various chemicals and particles that air pollution includes, and to study precisely how these various elements interact with, and in some cases fundamentally change, the human body.  Those advances have led to a rapid increase in published studies about air pollution over the past year, as researchers have focused their work on the interaction between pollution particles and human health. Multiple long-term studies of human health are beginning to produce results, as are ongoing studies of air pollution. Three studies published just last week illustrate the state of rapidly advancing science around air pollution today. In one study, Louisiana State University researcher Stephania Cormier reported that a particular type of free radicals (called environmentally persistent free radicals, or EPFRs), formed within the particulate matter emitted by cooking stoves, cars, factories, waste incinerators, wood fires, and cigarettes, can cause damage human cells. The findings could have broad implications for businesses, considering that the Supreme Court is currently wrestling with how to interpret the Clean Air Act.    Related: Health of millions at stake in emissions curb ruling, environmentalists warn    Cormier and her team divided a population of mice into two groups, exposing one to EPFRs and the other to no pollution. They then infected both groups with a flu virus. The pollution-exposed mice were rendered virtually defenseless to the virus: 20% more of them died from the flu. Instead of fighting off the disease, their bodies reacted by triggering an anti-inflammatory signal, Interleukin-10, and switching on both an immune-regulating protein called aryl hydrocarbon receptor and immune cells called regulatory T cells, both of which turn off the body’s defenses against infection. The researchers also found that the EPFRs caused oxidative stress, an imbalance between the production of free radicals and the ability of the body to counteract or detoxify their harmful effects. What that means for similarly exposed communities is that asthma and the flu will be more severe for vulnerable members, like infants and the elderly.  More and worse allergies Another study, published on 22 March by researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Germany, found that common traffic-related air pollutants may make allergies more severe. The study’s authors conducted lab tests and computer simulations to study the effect of ozone and nitrogen dioxide on a primary birch pollen, Bet v1, and found that both pollutants affected how proteins in the pollen bound together, potentially creating a more potent allergen. “Our research is showing that chemical modifications of allergenic proteins may play an important role in the increasing prevalence of allergies worldwide,” Christopher Kampf, one of the study’s authors, said in a statement.  Impact on the brain Yet another study released last week, this one a collaborative effort between researchers at the Institute for the Developing Mind at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and at Columbia University’s Center for Children’s Environmental Health, found a connection between common pollutants found in a wide range of emissions and cognitive and behavioral impairment. The study looked at the effects of airborne polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), a molecule prevalent in emissions from motor vehicles, oil and coal burning, wildfires and agricultural burning, hazardous waste sites, and tobacco smoke as well as charred foods. The research team selected 40 minority youth, born to Latina or African American women, that Columbia researchers have been following from birth, and used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure their brains. The Columbia researchers had previously reported that PAH exposure during gestation in this group was associated with multiple neurodevelopmental disturbances, including development delay by age 3, reduced verbal IQ at age 5, and symptoms of anxiety and depression at age 7. In the group of 40 studied in the MRI test, the researchers found a loss of the brain’s white matter surface, which correlates to slower processing of information and severe behavioral problems, including ADHD and aggression. Postnatal PAH exposure – measured at age 5 – was found to contribute to additional disturbances in development of white matter in a separate area of the brain, one associated with concentration, reasoning, judgment, and problem-solving ability. “This sample of 40 was quite ‘pure,’ in that their exposure to other known neurotoxicants was minimal, so we have more confidence in being able to attribute the brain abnormalities to the effects of prenatal and early childhood exposure to PAH,” Peterson said. While the study group was small, Peterson said these results emphasize what we already know about the harmful effects of tobacco and add to the growing base of knowledge about the impacts of other sources of air pollution. Given the mounting evidence, he said, clinicians should educate prospective parents about these risks, especially in early pregnancy. Peterson said that in less urban areas, exposure to pollutants from wildfires, agricultural burning and hazardous waste sites might be more relevant, and that women and children should remain indoors and use air conditioners as much as possible to avoid the airborne products of these fires. “As the link between air-borne pollutants and adverse brain changes is linear and seems not to have any threshold that defines safe and unsafe exposure, any reduction in exposure during the most active periods of brain development – in fetal life and in early childhood – will be helpful.” Translating research into action According to the most recent American Lung Association State of the Air report, more than half of Americans live in areas with dangerously high levels of air pollution. Children are the most severely impacted by air pollution, both in utero and in early childhood.  Air pollution also remains an issue of class and race. The dominant sources of pollution – traffic, industrial emissions, energy-related emissions (from oil refineries and coal plants), and hazardous waste – all disproportionately affect low-income and minority communities.   Related: Health of millions at stake in emissions curb ruling, environmentalists warn    The quickest way to improve the air quality of all communities is increased state and federal regulation of the sources of air pollution. To that end, the US Supreme Court is due to address two major Environmental Protection Agency rules this summer, one that aims to regulate cross-state air pollution and one that would require better pollution controls on coal power plants. Both have been criticized for being expensive and onerous to implement, but Supreme Court justices in favor of the rules have pointed to the EPA’s obligation to protect public health, not private profits. Judge Judith W Rogers wrote as much in the majority opinion on the EPA’s mercury rule, which would require coal power plants to install scrubbers that would limit mercury emissions, costing them $9.6bn a year. Rogers said the EPA’s focus on “factors relating to public health hazards, and not industry’s objections that emission controls are costly” should motivate Congress to make appropriate and necessary regulatory rules.  Moreover, because the scrubbers required would also reduce other air pollutants, the EPA has estimated that the rule would save $26bn to $89bn per year in healthcare costs. The latest batch of air pollution research helpssupport that claim.  “I hope that these studies and others like them will convince public-policy makers to address air pollution in our cities,” Peterson said.

"Millions of vulnerable people in southern England and Wales were advised to stay indoors as unusually high levels of air pollution smothered London and other cities, just weeks after heavy pollution led to restrictions on car use and the offer of free public transport in Brussels and Paris.Prof Frank Kelly of King's College London said tiny particles of pollution could cause problems for some people – such as those with asthma – and contribute to longer-term problems for others.""Periods of very high pollution in London arise usually because the city's normal pollution emissions are increased further by polluted air arriving on light winds from neighbouring areas such as northern Europe,"" he said. ""However, whether home-produced or arriving from the continent, the tiny particles we take into our bodies with each breath cause immediate problems for some individuals, such as those with asthma, and contribute to longer-term problems for most of us in the form of heart disease and stroke.""Leanne Stewart, from Eltham in south-east London, described feeling breathless after a routine half-mile walk to her son's  thisschool yesterday morning.""I've been doing the usual school run about half a mile from my house, which is usually quite an easy walk, but I'm still breathless now,"" she said. ""I could feel my chest getting tighter and tighter and my son, who's eight, had to stop and have his inhaler.""I went light-headed and had to get a bus back.

""More dust rain is possible during showers expected later this week.""Defra said air-pollution levels on Wednesday were expected to reach eight or nine on a 10-point scale in much of southern England, the Midlands and southern Wales.The south coast is forecast to see pollution hit the maximum level 10.Adults and children with lung problems, heart defects and older people are being urged to avoid any strenuous activity and asthmatics have been told to use their inhaler more often.Advice on the Defra website for the general population facing ""very high"" pollution levels states: ""Reduce physical exertion, particularly outdoors, especially if you experience symptoms such as a cough or sore throat.""Defra forecasters issued the fresh warning after air pollution levels reached 10 in north-west Norfolk on Tuesday.""For England and Wales, moderate to high air-pollution levels are forecast for central and south-east England, to the south and east of a line from around the Wash to Cheshire to east Devon, with local very high levels expected in parts of East Anglia and the East Midlands,"" said a Defra forecaster.Conditions are expected to worsen on Wednesday evening and into Thursday as the smog extends north.High levels of pollution are forecast to stretch across East Anglia, the Midlands, Lincolnshire, Wirral and north and east Wales, then further north over much of England's north-west coast, south-west Scotland and the north-east of Northern Ireland.Cleaner air from the Atlantic should bring some respite for south-west Wales and England's southernmost counties on Thursday, forecasters said, although many other parts of England and Wales will experience higher levels of smog than usual.Keith Taylor, the Green party's MEP for south-east England, said the high level of pollution showed the need for stronger government action.""Episodes like this often have a number of contributing factors,"" he said. ""What seems clear is that towns and cities across south-east England need to reduce the level of air pollution in their streets by cutting the amount of traffic. But on top of that it's clear that our government must play a role in pushing for stronger air pollution laws from the European Union, rather than trying to water down the rules we already have.""The UK faces fines of up to £300m a year and embarrassing court appearances after the European commission launched legal proceedings against it for failing to reduce ""excessive"" levels of nitrogen dioxide air pollution from traffic, despite 15 years of warnings and several extensions and postponements granted to the government.According to the World Health Organisation, air pollution has become the world's single biggest environmental health risk, linked to about 7 million deaths a year – or nearly one in eight deaths in 2012.",2014-04-02T15:18:00Z,UK smog alert: vulnerable people advised to stay indoors,,87,Warning comes as air pollution is expected to reach eight or nine on a 10-point scale in much of southern UK,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/2/1396420878963/Heathrow-airport-fog-006.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/apr/02/smog-alert-england-wales-air-pollution-saharan-dust,1,negative
"Schools are being urged to stop pupils from using playgrounds at lunchtime and employees to avoid cycling, running or walking to work during rush hour in the areas of England worst affected by the ongoing rise in pollution.The government, public health doctors and experts in pollution are also advising older people and those with a heart or lung problem such as asthma to avoid exercising outdoors and use a gym instead.One expert said the threat to health was so great that even usually healthy people who exercise outdoors, such as cyclists, might end up with a sore throat or cough until the pollution eases.For part of Wednesday, East Anglia experienced ""very high"" levels of pollution – the maximum on a 10-point scale – with ""high"" readings recorded in the south-east. Levels were moderate to high in much of England from Cheshire to north Devon, the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said.The surge in smog that began last weekend is expected to bring high levels on Thursday  in East Anglia and the Midlands, including Lincolnshire, eastern parts of Wales as well as Wirral and parts of coastal north-west England and south-west Scotland, but moderate or low elsewhere.The pollution is expected to ease from Friday, as cleaner south-westerly winds arrive, though there may be moderate levels in south-west England, Kent, North Yorkshire and parts of southern Scotland. The whole of the UK is expected to return to low levels by the weekend.A few schools in London kept pupils indoors at lunchtime on Wednesday to reduce their exposure to the smog. Their action prompted Professor Frank Kelly, a leading government adviser on air pollution, to state that the policy was sensible for schools in the worst affected areas.Banning pupils' access to outside recreational areas during the school day could reduce the number of asthma attacks and even avoid some developing potentially lifelong lung damage, said Kelly.""As a general response this is a good approach as children tend to run around outside and therefore breathe deeper. Thus, on days like this they will be aspiring a lot more pollution if outdoors than when they are breathing normally (hopefully) inside,"" said Kelly, who is professor of environmental health at King's College London, chair of the Department of Health's Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollution and a member of Defra's air quality expert group.Pupils with asthma may need to use their inhalers, while those with other breathing conditions could suffer serious harm if exposed to the high level of pollution being seen in London, he warned.""Besides those children whose asthma may be exacerbated by pollution and who would then need to increase their medication, the main issue is related to pollution exposure on a chronic basis as current evidence indicates that lung growth is restricted. If there is no subsequent catch-up lung growth then this respiratory deficit is carried forward through life.""Bowes and Chesterfield primary schools in Enfield, north London, kept children inside on Wednesday .""When schools are faced with conditions like these we have to decide what is best for children. In the absence of any formal advice from government, we decided to keep children inside as a precaution,"" said Tom Sheldon, chair of governors at both schools, which are near the often congested North Circular Road.""But we can't do this for ever, and in London we face the much wider problem of poor air quality every day.

"Blame the Sahara desert for the present air pollution. Blame Europe. Blame climate change – or even the spring sunshine, or the hole in the ozone layer. But if you are in government please don't mention the fact that the toxic air much of Britain has been breathing is mostly of our own making.Don't look on the front page of Defra's website for an explanation of its composition, or expect ministers to admit this is a public health emergency. And certainly don't expect local or central government to take action, such as reducing car numbers in the streets or closing down factories. That's what the Chinese and French governments do when the air in their cities is unbreathable and their people are choking. Not us.What we are not being told is that the milky, hazy skies shrouding southern Britain are the result of tiny particulates, or aerosols, that scatter sunlight and come from our own traffic, power stations, farming, construction sites, central heating boilers and industry. Our own bad air is mixing with pollution drifting in from mainland Europe and a bit of Saharan dust, picked up by unusual weather conditions that have trapped the foul mix over a wide area. It will take until  Thursday at the earliest before westerly winds begin to disperse it, the Met office says.But the results of this will be seen over the coming months as hospitals report increased admissions from people suffering respiratory diseases, strokes, heart attacks and worsening lung conditions. Last year, according to the government's own figures, more than 29,000 people died prematurely from air pollution in Britain, with 4,300 in London alone.But premature death is just the tip of the iceberg. In the short term, polluted air leads to irritation to the eyes, nose and throat, headaches, nausea, bronchitis and pneumonia; and over a longer period it results in heart attacks, lung diseases, cancers, and damage to the brain, nerves, liver, and kidneys. We now know that children living near busy roads can show reduced lung capacity by the age of five, and that the poor are most affected as they live in the most polluted areas.Slowly, it is dawning on people that the risks from air pollution are far greater than previously thought or understood. Last week, the extremely cautious World Health Organisation revised its figures and reported that nearly one in eight of the world's deaths – more than 7 million people a year – are now the direct result of air pollution, and that for every person who dies, there are many more whose health is impaired long term. Put bluntly:  every year air pollution kills more people than Aids, smoking, road accidents and diabetes combined, and is the world's single biggest environmental health risk.Last week, even as Paris banned some traffic to reduce air pollution, London played down the problem, even though our air was just as polluted. London's mayor, Boris Johnson, has several times warned the vulnerable to avoid outdoor exercise, but he is accused of doing virtually nothing to reduce the causes of pollution. As the London assembly member Jenny Jones, Friends of the Earth and others point out, Europe's most polluted major city has no emergency plans to deal with air pollution and no powers even to restrict traffic during periods of smog.Central government, too, has tried to wash its hands of the problem although it knows that air pollution is costing the NHS billions of pounds a year, and that the supreme court has ruled that the state has a legal duty to protect us from it. Last month the EU finally, after 15 years of warnings, extensions and postponements, launched legal proceedings against Britain for failing to reduce ""excessive"" levels of air pollution. The government now faces fines of £300m a year, but we can expect it to try everything to reduce pollution – bar restricting traffic.The need to clear the air is just as great today as in the 1950s when peasouper smogs killed thousands. In 1956 a brave government passed the first Clean Air Act that banned coal burning and reduced pollution spectacularly. Today we have the laws from Europe that would do the same, but no government seems prepared to implement them.",2014-04-02T16:11:00Z,The toxic truth about air pollution: a lethal scandal of British inaction,,89,<strong>John Vidal:</strong> The 'Saharan' smog is a crisis of our own making.

About a third of the days are over 200.           3.29pm BST       As a point of interest, our colleagues over at Comment is Free flagged up this piece from last week on clean air, which poses an interesting question:  Is clean air, along with drinkable water, becoming one of the most precious resources on the planet? Or should we reframe the question and challenge the kind of thinking that converts everything, including the very air we breathe, into economically measurable reserves and commodities?﻿        2.59pm BST       So just where does this pinky-red dust come from?  Dr Steven Godby, a drylands expert at Nottingham Trent University, thinks he has the answer:  The Sahara is the largest desert in the world and contains a number of significant dust source areas. Looking at satellite images captured last Thursday and Friday it seems the dust was generated from two source areas, one in central Algeria close to Tamanrasset and another in southern Morocco to the south of the Atlas Mountains.  To generate dust storms large numbers of silt-sized particles are needed for the wind to pick up and transport and these two areas have been identified as dust ‘hot spots’ in the past.   Dr Robert Bryant, from the University of Sheffield’s Department of Geography, is also researching the effects of Saharan dust being blown into the UK. He says:  The dust that has blown over from the Sahara and caused this mist of toxic air (which has been mixed with other pollutants from Europe on route to the UK) is largely made up of fine soil particles that are ejected into the atmosphere by the action of strong winds on the surface of the Earth. Once caught in the wind, these small particles can travel large distances before returning to the surface either via rainfall or simply under the influence of gravity.  Wind erosion of soils is particularly apparent in arid regions, where soils tend to be dry and vegetation, which can protect soil, tends to be sparse. In these regions we can see that the frequency of dust storms is changing in response to unsustainable agriculture in some parts of Africa and apparent impacts of climatic change.        2.44pm BST       Forget the smog, the Sun is out and offering to wash your dust-covered cars:    Sahara storm leaves UK carpeted in red dust, but #Sunsqueegeesquad can help!

Photograph: David Surman/Tumblr    He told us he&apos;s noticed a definite built up in air pollution over the last few days.  I noticed over the past three days how the build up of air pollution was giving a distinctive yellow haze throughout the day. It&apos;s quite different from London&apos;s pleasant misty days which tend to subside throughout the afternoon. The pollution definitely accumulates over several days of still weather.        1.14pm BST       If you ever wondered how London compared to other major cities in the smog rankings, wonder no more. This comparison, by the World Health Organisation (WHO), shows that on any given day in Beijing is likely to be far more polluted than Paris. And London. And most cities in the world. Lagos being a notable exception.             1.08pm BST       My colleague Peter Walker has this on the conditions for fellow cycling enthusiasts battling the smog:  The warnings for asthmatics and the like to avoid exercise in the smog might put some people off cycling today, but if you&apos;re riding sedately then you&apos;re not necessarily exposing yourself to that much more in the way of emissions. We ran a piece about air pollution on the Bike Blog a few weeks ago based on the work of some experts from King&apos;s College London. Interestingly, a test they did measuring smog exposure among a series of people in London over a day found a cycle courier was exposed to less black carbon (the substance they were measuring, an unpleasant particulate associated with diesel engines) than, for example, an ambulance driver sitting inside a vehicle. This was a pretty basic initial test, and of course measured exposure, not ingestion, but the academics suggested a cyclist might be helped by being constantly on the move, thus creating air flow. Plus, of course, a trip in a city on a bike is likely to be quicker than that on a bus, reducing exposure.As for tips for wheezy cyclists like me, the best is to cycle on minor roads if you can, where smog levels tend to be notably lower. There is some research suggesting pollution masks, rarely seen on cyclists these days, might actually do some good. On a personal level, I could really feel the smog on my lungs cycling home through London last night. Air pollution shortens an estimated 30,000 lives in Britain each year. If that was the death toll from, say, terrorist attacks you&apos;d think ministers might take it a bit more seriously.        12.53pm BST        The environment campaign group Friends of the Earth has called on the London mayor Boris Johnson and the government to end what it calls the &quot;national disgrace&quot; of air pollution in Britain. Air pollution campaigner Jenny Bates said:   There’s not much we can do to control dust from the Sahara, but the authorities could and should be doing far more to deal with the UK’s contribution to this air pollution episode, particularly from road traffic emissions. We need cleaner vehicles, a serious strategy for tackling traffic levels, including the provision of better public transport and cycling facilities, and an end to plans to build new roads.        12.12pm BST       The author Lucinda Hawksley has been in touch to describe how she was struggling with the effects of asthma on the way to work this morning:  I&apos;m relying heavily on meds today, which I usually take very seldom, and people on the tube were giving me that wary angry look they give constant coughers - I felt like I should be wearing a sign that says &apos;It&apos;s not contagious, it&apos;s asthma.  I woke up early, I live in London, and felt my lungs struggling. It got better after closing the window so if other people are suffering badly they really should heed the advice and stay indoors. Having said which my asthma is mild and I&apos;m on my way to give a lecture, albeit breathlessly.        12.09pm BST       Our picture desk has put together this gallery of the air pollution across England.

I was rushing around all day and not a problem but this morning it feels like the air&apos;s heavy. I do that walk twice a day with no problem but today I just had to get the bus. I can usually see Crystal Palace tower from my front window and today I can&apos;t see it at all – I can just about see the bottom of the hill. The dust that&apos;s settling with the cars today as well – there&apos;s a thick covering on all the cars. And when I brought my washing in all my whites are almost pink!     Updated at 11.45am BST     10.50am BST    Defra website down    The smog appears to have claimed its first victim: the official government website for air pollution. Readers, including discuz in the comments below, have pointed out that the Defra website for monitoring the smog appears to be struggling under the weight of traffic. (Although when we tried at 10.50am if was slowly coming back to life).    Updated at 10.51am BST     10.35am BST       The Guardian&apos;s John Vidal has written about the noxious gases that contribute to modern day air pollution – and why they may even be more harmful than historical smog:  Don&apos;t kid yourself this is all to do with dust blowing in from the Sahara desert, as some commentators are suggesting. Sure, there&apos;s minute particles of dust there from the deep south but it&apos;s mixed up with much larger quantities of minute particles of homegrown exhaust fumes, brake pad linings, dust from construction sites, central heating systems and industry. What we have in southern Britain is a dangerous smog episode produced mainly by sunlight reacting with nitrogen oxides, emitted largely by traffic, and volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the atmosphere. When sunlight hits these chemicals, they form airborne particles and the result is ground-level ozone or smog. Because of the high pressure that has built up over the last few weeks, a great soup of this is now settled across Britain and parts of northern Europe. While the government is correct to say that much of it comes blown in from the continent, that conveniently masks the fact that London and southeast England, especially, emit some of the worst pollution in Europe every day. That&apos;s why the government is being taken to court for not getting air pollution under control. The other myth is that when people cant actually see pollution, as they used to when everyone burned coal, they think it&apos;s not dangerous. Wrong. In the old days, people could naturally cough up the great flecks of particulate matter they breathed. Now doctors say it it is burned so fine that it gets far deeper into the lungs. Diesel cars emit fewer hydrocarbons, and less carbon monoxide and lead pollution than petrol cars, but they produce far more noxious gases and significantly more minute health-damaging particles (pms). These and gases like NO2 which spew from diesel exhausts are invisible and may be even more dangerous than the pollution people experienced in the old days.      Planes taxi in fog at Terminal 5 at Heathrow airport in west London Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA      Updated at 10.53am BST     10.23am BST       I&apos;ve just spoken to Alan Andrews, one of the lawyers involved in the landmark Supreme Court case last year that ruled the UK had failed in its duty to protect people from the harmful effects of air pollution. Andrews, a lawyer at the environmental law firm ClientEarth, is sceptical about the emphasis being put on the dust storm in the Sahara – saying that the core of the current problem was generated by the UK. He said:   This highlights the need for urgent action. It&apos;s not ideal for people to be told they can&apos;t walk around outside or take exercise. We need to build a national network of low emission zones which target diesel vehicles. And we need to tackle the problem holistically at the EU level with the UK taking a lead role in EU negotiations.  Read the full story on the Supreme Court ruling from 1 May last year.       10.03am BST    We want your pictures    Providing you can see the phone in your hand , please send us your pictures of the air pollution where you are – whether its a dust-covered car or a smog-smothered walk in the park. To send in your picture, simply click on the blue Guardian Witness contribute button above.       9.39am BST       Professor Frank Kelly, of King&apos;s College London, has said that the tiny particles of pollution can cause immediate problems for some people – such as those with asthma – and contribute to longer term problems for most of us in the form of heart disease and stroke.   For those who are sensitive to air pollution its important they are provided with accurate forecasts of when air quality will deteriorate so they can plan their activities to reduce exposure, perhaps by taking different routes to work or school or avoiding strenuous exercise on those days.   Even those who do not feel any particular sensitivity to air pollution can benefit from such avoidance techniques but they will have to wait several decades to see the benefit.        9.09am BST       The unusually high levels of air pollution have triggered health warnings for millions of people in southern England and Wales, particularly those with heart or lung problems. One of Britain&apos;s top medical professionals, Dr Paul Cosford, of Public Health England, was on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme earlier today. He said:  That most important advice is for those people who are vulnerable, if you&apos;re in a high pollution area, to reduce the amount of strenuous exercise outdoors over the next few days. Carry on life as normal – be aware you may need to use your inhalers more frequently – but carry on your life as normal. We do have problems with air pollution in our cities. The main sources we have are vehicle transport and the industrial process, when you put that alongside the unusual weather consequences like the Saharan dust ... then that&apos;s when you get these few days of unusually high pollution.        8.49am BST       My colleague, Mark Tran, wrote on Tuesday about the global problem of air pollution – and how the current episode could bring more attention to the government&apos;s 15-year struggle to tackle the issue:  According to the World Health Organisation, air pollution has become the world&apos;s single biggest environmental health risk, linked to around seven million deaths a year – or nearly one in eight deaths in 2012. The figures released last month were more than double previous estimates and suggest that outdoor pollution from traffic fumes and coal-burning, and indoor pollution from wood and coal stoves, kills more people than smoking, road deaths and diabetes combined. The UK faces fines of up to £300m a year and embarrassing court appearances after the European commission launched legal proceedings against it for failing to reduce &quot;excessive&quot; levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) air pollution from traffic, despite 15 years of warnings and several extensions and postponements granted to the government.        8.38am BST       Here is the latest air pollution index from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). As you can see, the worst affected areas are East Anglia and into the East Midlands, but high levels of pollution are stretching deep into England and Wales.

People across large swaths of England and Wales have been put on high alert this morning over severe levels of air pollution smothering the south coast and several major cities. Forecasters warned that one of the year&apos;s worst smogs would worsen on Wednesday, with air pollution reaching the maximum &quot;very high&quot; level in many parts of southern Britain.

"Air pollution has become the world's single biggest environmental health risk, linked to around 7 million – or nearly one in eight deaths in 2012 – according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).The new figures are more than double previous estimates and suggest that outdoor pollution from traffic fumes and coal-burning, and indoor pollution from wood and coal stoves, kills more people than smoking, road deaths and diabetes combined.Around 80% of the 3.7 million deaths from outdoor pollution came as a result of stroke and heart disease, 11% from lung diseases and 6% from cancers. The vast majority were in Asia, with 180,000 in the Americas and Europe combined, said the WHO.Indoor air pollution led to 4.3 million deaths, of which 34% were caused by strokes, 26% heart diseases and 12% respiratory disease  in children. Only 19,000 of these deaths were in rich countries, with the vast majority being in low- and middle-income countries. Because many people are exposed to both indoor and outdoor air pollution, the WHO said deaths attributed to the two sources cannot be added together.""The risks from air pollution are now far greater than previously thought or understood, particularly for heart disease and strokes,"" said Maria Neira, director of WHO's department for public health, environmental and social determinants of health. ""Few risks have a greater impact on global health today than air pollution; the evidence signals the need for concerted action to clean up the air we all breathe.""South-east Asia, said the WHO, is now the most polluted region in the world, with 3.3 million deaths linked to indoor air pollution and 2.6 million deaths related to outdoor air pollution. This reflects the explosive growth of cities and industrial development in China and India, as well as continuing deep poverty in rural areas.A woman breastfeeds her baby while another prepares food on an open fire indoor in Kagera, Tanzania. Women had higher levels of exposure than men in developing countries. Photograph: Jochem Wijnands/AlamyThe new estimates are based not on an significant increase in pollution, but on improved knowledge of the links between air pollutants and heart diseases and cancers, in addition to known links with respiratory diseases. A 2008 WHO report estimated that outdoor pollution led to about 1.3 million deaths, while about 1.9 million people were killed by indoor pollution. A Lancet study last year suggested that the surge in car use in south and east Asia killed 2.1 million people prematurely in 2010. Last year, WHO's cancer agency classified air pollution as a carcinogen, linking dirty air to lung and bladder cancer.""Cleaning up the air we breathe prevents non-communicable diseases as well as reduces disease risks among women and vulnerable groups, including children and the elderly,"" said Dr Flavia Bustreo, WHO assistant director general of family, women and children's health. ""Poor women and children pay a heavy price from indoor air pollution since they spend more time at home breathing in smoke and soot from leaky coal and wood cook stoves.""Martin Williams, professor of air quality at the environmental research group, King's College London, said: ""This is an important study, and although the majority of attributable deaths occur in south-east Asia and the western Pacific, air pollution impacts on mortality and health are still a significant public health problem in Europe, including the UK.""Air pollution is increasingly linked with ill health and deaths in rich countries as traffic emissions rise. In the US, air pollution causes about 200,000 early deaths a year, with emissions from cars and trucks causing 53,000 and power generation 52,000, according to MIT's environment laboratory. California suffers most from air pollution, with 21,000 early deaths.In Europe, poor air quality is the top environmental cause of premature deaths in the EU, causing more than 100,000 premature deaths a year and costing from £300bn-£800bn a year in extra health costs, said Janez Potočnik, the EU environment commissioner.Air pollution causes 29,000 early deaths a year in the UK and similar numbers in France and Germany.",2014-03-25T12:51:02Z,WHO: air pollution 'is single biggest environmental health risk',,93,<p>New figures link indoor and outdoor air pollution to around 7 millon deaths a year – more than double previous estimates</p>,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395750977323/Heavy-pollution-fog-on-Ne-004.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/25/air-pollution-single-biggest-environmental-health-risk-who,6,negative
"Ajay’s 63-year-old frame strains with each breath. He is lying on an emergency-room stretcher in one of Kathmandu’s large hospitals and he appears exhausted. Behind the oxygen mask, his eyes have the panicked, haunted look of a man who can’t breathe. He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, an umbrella term for emphysema and chronic bronchitis. It is killing him. COPD is most often associated with smokers, but Ajay, like many seeking help at Kathmandu emergency rooms, has never smoked. He has, however, worked at road construction in the capital for many years, labouring with a pickaxe and inhaling fumes daily from the eclectic mix of vehicles: ancient buses spewing black smoke, three-wheeled tempos in varying degrees of disrepair and tractors with open motors. Countless cars and legions of motorcycles add to the exhaust fumes, through which pedestrians, bicycles and animals weave in a chaotic flow of traffic that somehow remains in motion. Nepal generally evokes images of a pristine mountain nation on top of the world. The thick cloud of pollution that threatens to suffocate Nepal’s largest city, however, provides a stark contrast to this reputation. While there are several environmental crises converging here – severe water shortages, for instance, have become status quo – none is as dire as air quality. In the past 10 years, the number of vehicles on Kathmandu’s streets has risen threefold. The problem has become so acute that many of its 1.74 million residents are left wondering: at what point will their city become unliveable?     Kathmandu has experienced a threefold increase in the number of vehicles on its streets since 2000. Photograph: Sara Germain    Nepal’s air quality ranks 177th out of 178 countries, according to Yale’s 2014 Environmental Performance Index (EPI), better only than Bangladesh. As a physician working in one of Kathmandu’s main teaching hospitals, I see a disproportionate amount of patients with respiratory ailments who are admitted to the wards on a daily basis, the victims of dirty air. Walking to and from work along the crowded, exhaust-choked streets, I sometimes wonder how more people are not sick. The view from my Kathmandu rooftop certainly seems to bear the EPI findings out. On many days, the relatively close Himalayan mountains are obscured by smog, the brick apartment buildings that form Kathmandu’s skyline shrouded in an oppressive cloud. Those new to Kathmandu frequently complain of sore throats and itchy eyes within a few days of arrival. “I see rapid changes each time I return,” says Anobha Gurung, a Kathmandu-born doctoral candidate at Yale who is studying the air quality in her home city. “Now it is a common sight to see a gray haze for the valley, especially during the winter months, and city residents venturing out of homes wearing masks.” Gurung and her colleagues have found that during surges in Kathmandu traffic congestion, the level of small particulate matter can measure over 500 micrograms per cubic metre, or 20 times the World Health Organisation’s safe upper limit. By comparison, the recent smog alarm that led Paris to ban cars peaked at just over a fifth of that level: 110 micrograms per cubic metre.     The sight of Kathmandu residents wearing masks is an increasingly common sight. Photograph: Sara Germain    Further data is hard to come by. Nepal’s government has several monitoring stations throughout the city, but they have been abandoned for at least six years. Samir KC, a Nepali researcher based in Vienna who has studied pollution and monitoring in Kathmandu, says the monitors were allowed to fall into disrepair. “During our [study], we found that the repair was done and it was up to the government to pay the bill and start the monitoring,” he said. “Nothing happened.” Most of the research on air quality in Nepal focuses on indoor pollution: cooking fires are ubiquitous in the countryside. In the capital, however, this may be misleading. “Cooking fires are definitely not the cause, as most households use [propane] gas,” says Samir KC. “Suspended particles including dust, exhaust from vehicles and diesel generators are the main culprits.” Of these, it is vehicle congestion that is most strongly correlated to worsening air quality, according to Gurung’s research. Findings such as these pose a developmental conundrum for governments intent on modernising. It is one thing to stamp out indoor cooking fires as part of the path towards progress. It is quite another, especially in Asian cities that are increasingly oriented around cars, to try to reduce the emissions that come hand-in-hand with industrialisation and urbanisation.     The level of small particulate matter in the air in Kathmandu can reach 20 times the WHO’s safe upper limit. Photograph: Sara Germain    What’s more, modernisation has also fuelled the appetite for electricity, yet infrastructure has not kept pace. Kathmandu endures daily, scheduled “brownouts”. This has had the predictable consequence of driving people to use generators: when the power goes off, their dull roar can be heard throughout the city, pumping yet more toxic fumes into the air. At present, the Nepali government is either unwilling or unable to make changes. Urban planning of the kind that addresses ecological issues is largely absent. But the situation is not lost on ordinary Nepalis. Daily, newspapers print letters decrying the situation and demanding better from elected officials. Air quality is a frequent topic of conversation here; facemasks are so commonplace, they are now sold in trendy designer styles made of patterned cloth. Other people use scarves to shield their faces.  In the hospital, for the time being Ajay continues to gasp for air. For smokers with COPD, one of the only effective interventions that improves longevity is to quit smoking. But Ajay and those like him have no cigarettes to give up. The air they breathe is making them sick. For them, the question of whether the city will become unliveable is moot. It already is. • Andrew Lodge is a doctor at a teaching hospital in Kathmandu • How are cities&apos; accelerating growth affecting their poorest children?",2014-03-21T11:58:37Z,Has air pollution made Kathmandu unliveable?,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-a601a86d-ac57-4db4-817a-1493c4b035e3""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/21/1395395835845/75de949c-b88b-4571-8b46-b6caec009fd3-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""The pollution-choked streets of Kathmandu.

"Licence-plate driving bans such as the one implemented in Paris this week  are not the solution to urban air pollution, according to analysis of recent data. In fact, arbitrary restrictions have been shown to make air pollution worse in the long term.Long-running licence plate schemes operate in many cities, including Athens, Beijing and Mexico City. Some ban cars every second day, others once a week. But drivers inevitably circumvent restrictions by buying cheap, inefficient cars with opposing number plates according to Lucy Sadler, who runs the Low Emission Zones in Europe website. This means some schemes have had an adverse effect on air quality.""Certainly, in terms of comparison between low emission zones and odd-and-even number plate schemes, it's a no-brainer,"" Sadler said. ""There is lots of good evidence saying low emission zones have a good impact on air quality and health. That's robust and well researched.""""As the [licence plate] traffic restriction can also affect cleaner vehicles, there is no incentive for motorists to invest in cleaner cars with particle filters or catalysts,"" said Martin Lutz, from Berlin's Department for Urban Development and Environment.Beijing introduced an odd-even number plate ban during the 2008 Olympic Games. A one-day a week scheme remains in place. Photograph: Jason Lee/ReutersLutz agreed that low emission zones (LEZs) , hundreds of which now operate in Europe since Stockholm implemented the first in 1996, are a more effective way of decreasing the contribution of traffic to air pollution. LEZs ban inefficient vehicles from city centres, forcing drivers to upgrade their cars.On Monday, the French government reacted to dangerous levels of pollution by requiring cars with licence plates ending with an even number to stay off the road. Nearly 4,000 fines of €22 were issued to drivers who flaunted the restriction. It was the second time Paris had implemented a short-term ban in response to high smog levels; the city's air quality authority, Airparif, says such measures are effective in combating pollution emergencies.But Ben Barratt, from King's College London, said the effect of short-term actions is difficult to assess. ""The weather changes all the time, the emissions change all the time and trying to pin down whether a particular emergency scheme works or not is hard.""Short-term schemes also cause mass disruption and dissatisfaction, Sadler added. ""The impact to society and to vehicle operators is horrendous. Suddenly, tomorrow, you're not allowed to move.""Residents get on their bikes during a car-free day in Bogotá, Colombia.  Photograph: Fernando Vergara/APResearch on the impact of licence plate-based schemes is rare, but an analysis of existing data shows a mixed set of results. Conversely, LEZs and congestion charges, which encourage drivers to use public transport and shift to more efficient cars, are proven to reduce concentrations of dangerous particles and chemicals which cause more than 1.3 million premature deaths in cities every year.Asked if it was fair to place the burden on drivers, particularly low-income drivers, Sadler said those who earned less tended to use public transport, and the responsibility for the pollution created by cars should ultimately rest on the person at the wheel. ""If somebody's polluting, why should society subsidise that? In air pollution, the polluter pays in principle.""But according to Barratt, LEZs should be used alongside inner-city congestion charges, as they are in London: ""You have to take the vehicles off the road, rather than just try and make them cleaner. So something like congestion charging, where you've got a marked decrease in the number of vehicles on the road, is preferable to something where you've got the same number of vehicles, [even if] those are cleaner.""A sign marks the start of Berlin's LEZ, which bans all petrol and diesel vehicles without a closed loop catalytic converter.  Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty ImagesCity traffic case studies&nbsp;MexicoThe Hoy No Circula ('today it doesn't circulate') was introduced by Mexico City in 1989 to combat rampant air pollution. The city bans cars for one day per week, depending on the last number of their number plate. On Mondays five and six don't drive, on Tuesdays it's seven and eight, and so on. The programme was initially successful in bringing down pollution levels, with carbon monoxide (CO) dropping by 11%. But residents began buying second cars (often old inefficient ones) to get around the ban. The long-term impact of the scheme on CO levels has been a 13% rise.&nbsp;BogotáBogotá's Pico y Placa ('peak and plate') banned cars from driving during the peak traffic hour, two days per week. The Colombians sought to improve on the Mexican model by switching the combinations of days and numbers every year, making it harder to circumvent by buying another car. The policy has failed to deliver clear benefits in air pollution. Restrictions have been tightened periodically, with some of the changes leading to reductions in CO and airborne particles. But one study found most of the major pollutant concentrations were worse because drivers were driving in off-peak hours and driving more to get around the measures.BeijingDuring the 2008 Olympic Games, Beijing banned cars on the basis of odd and even numbers, similar to the French ban this week. In conjunction with some fortuitous rain and the shutting down of the factories and industries that cause much of Beijing's pollution, the ban drove airborne particulate matter concentrations during the Olympics down by 20%. After the Games, the Beijing authorities kept a one-day a week ban in place. But this, like other long-term licence plate bans, has had a limited effect on air pollution and encouraged drivers to buy second cars.&nbsp;StockholmThe Swedish capital implemented its LEZ in 1996. Vehicles are banned from these zones if they fall below certain EU emissions standards . The Stockholm LEZ brought emissions of nitric oxide&nbsp;(NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) down by 20% and particulate emissions down by half. The effect of this on the air quality was noticeable, with NO and NO2 concentrations down 1.3% and particulate concentrations down 3%.&nbsp;LondonA £5 congestion charge  to drive on London's innermost streets was implemented in 2003. Studies showed emissions of dangerous pollutants – NO, NO2 and small particulate matter (PM10) – were reduced by 12%. The charge is now £10.In 2008, Transport for London introduced an LEZ, which governs the efficiency of lorries, buses and coaches for the whole of Greater London. The zone led to a fall of 20% in tiny particulate matter (PM2.5) but had no discernable impact on PM10 or NO2. Critics say London's LEZ needs to include private vehicles if it is to be effective.&nbsp;BerlinImplemented in 2008, Berlin's LEZ bans all diesel vehicles and petrol vehicles without a closed loop catalytic converter. The effect on levels of diesel pollution, which is a known carcinogen , has been dramatic. Concentrations of diesel particulates have dropped by 14-22%. PM10 concentrations near main roads are down 3% and the number of days when the city's air pollution exceeds European standards has fallen by four to 24 days per year.• Air of revolution: how activists and social media scrutinise city pollution",2014-03-20T12:30:00Z,Why licence plate bans don't cut smog,,95,"<p>Car bans such as the one earlier this week in Paris can even make air pollution worse in the long term, analysis shows</p>",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/20/1395316884338/Paris-car-ban-police-offi-006.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/mar/20/licence-plate-driving-bans-paris-ineffective-air-pollution,6,negative
"China's largest online travel agency is now offering tourists ""smog insurance"", permitting travellers to claim financial compensation should their city break be blighted by bad air. Ctrip.com has created the ""haze-travel insurance package"" in collaboration with the Chinese insurance firm Ping An and has been selling the new product since Tuesday.The insurance is focused on six cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Xi'an, all of which are popular with tourists – and also suffer from poor air quality. Pollution in China was recently described by scientists as like a ""nuclear winter"" and smog frequently grounds flights and keeps tourists at home. On one day during a recent bout of bad weather, Beijing's Forbidden City saw visitor numbers drop to 11,200: a quarter of its usual daily draw.Under the new insurance package, tourists who spend at least two days in the designated city while pollution levels are high will be able to file claims. The level of pollution that triggers an insurance claim varies between the cities but for visitors to Shanghai, claims can be made if the air pollution index exceeds 100. In the past month the city experienced 17 days over this level.Evidently aimed at domestic rather than international tourists, the premium comes to 10RMB (£1) and travellers can claim 50RMB (£5) per day.The data for the pollution will be measured using the China Air Quality Index app, which broadcasts the levels of all the country's major cities and is among the top 10 most popular weather apps in China. The popularity of the app is in itself an indication of the lengths Chinese people will go to avoid pollution.In Hong Kong, bad air quality and poor visibility has led visitors to pose for photos in front of a photo backdrop of the city's skyline. However, when it comes to smog insurance not all tourists in the country are convinced. Tian Yiyi, a sales representative with a Shanghai-based furniture company, told China Daily that despite travelling widely she would not be buying the premium. ""The premium does not go directly to tackle the heavily polluted air,"" she said. ""I would like the money to be put to better use.""Qian Yigang, 28, a technician at a Shanghai-based IT company told the paper: ""People travel around for fun. If their mood is upset by poor atmospheric conditions, it cannot be fixed by money.""",2014-03-19T13:29:45Z,Chinese smog insurance: travel agency offers air pollution policies,,96,"China's largest online travel agency has launched a 'haze-travel insurance package', allowing tourists to claim compensation for days ruined by pollution",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2014/3/19/1395230585678/An-artist-in-Jingshan-Par-006.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/mar/19/chinese-smog-insurance-ctrip-travel-agency-air-pollution-policies,2,negative
"Air pollution is deteriorating in many places around the world.  In Shanghai, such is the oppressive smog, covering the city with a toxic cloud, that authorities have had to instal gigantic TV screens to broadcast the sunrise. Salt Lake City has such poor air quality that chemicals in the atmosphere not only give it a different hue but leave residents with a foul, metallic taste in their mouths. Closer to home, Paris has experienced some of its worst air pollution in recent days, while in the EU as a whole, even at permitted concentrations, industrial and traffic-related pollution is harming cardiovascular health.Is clean air, along with drinkable water, becoming one of the most precious resources on the planet? Or should we reframe the question and challenge the kind of thinking that converts everything, including the very air we breathe, into economically measurable reserves and commodities?Today we live in a world so complicated and, moreover, organised so differently according to the cultures we belong to, that encountering each other as humans has become almost impossible. However, instead of asking what it means to be human, alleged experts in various domains discuss at great length how to establish coexistence among people. No doubt such an objective is both relevant and urgent, but in their debates, these experts in peace stray far from a solution, getting lost in technical detail without considering the universal sharing of life, from which we could start again. Even if it makes sceptics laugh, we have no viable solution other than to experience the universal human condition as that of a living being, standing naked in the garden that the earth is. After all, with every breath we take, we expose our lungs to the outside world, regardless of all the barriers we have erected between the environment and ourselves. The resistance to envisaging this alternative is due to a nihilistic preference for certain powers – be they material or spiritual, capitalist or cultural – over life itself. Such a stance is both suicidal and murderous, even though few people actually intend it to be so negative. How can they recover their taste for life and learn ways of cultivating it, in themselves, with others, and in the natural world?The fact that public parks in cities become crowded as soon as the sun shines proves that people long to breathe in green, open spaces. They do not all know what they are seeking but they flock there, nevertheless. And, in these surroundings, they are generally both peaceful and peaceable. It is rare to see people fighting in a garden. Perhaps struggle unfolds first, not at an economic or social level, but over the appropriation of air, essential to life itself. If human beings can breathe and share air, they don't need to struggle with one another. And consequently, it appears to be a basic crime against humanity to contribute to air pollution.Unfortunately, in our western tradition, neither  materialist nor idealist theoreticians give enough consideration to this basic condition for life. As for politicians, despite proposing curbs on environmental pollution, they have not yet called for it to be made a crime. Wealthy countries are even allowed to pollute if they pay for it.But is our life worth anything other than money? Are we, then, still living? Or, do we only sense what life could be when we enjoy green spaces?The plant world shows us in silence what faithfulness to life consists of. It also helps us to a new beginning, urging us to care for our breath, not only at a vital but also at a spiritual level. We must, in turn, care for it, opposing any sort of pollution that destroys both our world and that of plants. The interdependence to which we must pay the closest attention is that which exists between ourselves and the vegetal world. Often described as ""the lungs of the planet"", the woods that cover the earth offer us the gift of breathable air by releasing oxygen. But their capacity to renew the air polluted by industry has long reached its limit. If we lack the air necessary for a healthy life (or, indeed, for any kind of life), it is because we have filled it with chemicals and undercut the ability of plants to regenerate it. As we know, rapid deforestation combined with the massive burning of fossil fuels, which are largely the remnants of past plants, is an explosive recipe for an irreversible disaster.The fight over the appropriation of resources will lead the entire planet to an abyss unless humans learn to share life, both with each other and with plants. This task is simultaneously ethical and political because it can be discharged only when each takes it upon her – or himself – and only when it is accomplished together with others. The lesson taught by plants is that sharing life augments and enhances the sphere of the living, while dividing life into  so-called natural or human resources diminishes it. We must come to view the air, the plants and ourselves as the contributors to the preservation of life and growth, rather than a mesh of quantifiable objects or productive potentialities at our disposal. Perhaps then we would finally begin to live, rather than being concerned with bare survival.",2014-03-17T21:30:00Z,"Without clean air, we have nothing",,97,"<p><strong>Luce Irigaray and Michael Marder: </strong>As smog contaminates Paris, Shanghai and other world cities, we should regard pollution as a crime against humanity</p>",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/17/1395083909662/Heavy-smog-in-Shanghai--006.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/17/clean-air-paris-pollution-crime-against-humanity,3,negative

Cars are losing spaces of circulation for the profit of other transports and stay stuck in endless jams with their motor running, which make pollution worse. One more proof of how ideology is hell.                 jonbean    17 March 2014 5:16pm  Dirty diesel needs to be banned in cities like London and Paris. It kills thousands every year. Some very modern diesels engines are not too bad but most over 5 years old are positively dangerous. A real scandal that Boris decided to let some old diesel taxis stay on the road - this has cost many lives.                 theendisnigh2    17 March 2014 1:46pm  I get the feeling Paris is the victim of its own success in this case, since the roads network to get into and out of town is so brilliant that I really enjoy driving there - albeit only during the holidays. The problem is that the system is so well designed, with loads of great underground parking provision that everyone drives in. They just need electric cars, then this particular problem will go away.           6.28pm GMT    My verdict    Today’s question was easy. It is almost insulting to Beijing’s residents, who live consistently with levels of pollution similar to those seen in Paris last week, to compare the two cities. It is true that Beijing saw comparatively low levels of pollution on Friday, while Paris, London and much of Europe slipped into pollution levels that are considered dangerous to human health. Even today’s more moderate smog was worse than readings from Beijing. But Beijing’s annual mean concentrations of tiny PM10 particles and even tinier PM2.5 particles are three and five times larger than Paris respectively. Both types of particle are dangerous to human health. The spike in Paris, in which the air quality index rose to 185, would constitute a fairly humdrum day in Beijing and many other Chinese cities. Last month, pollution levels in the Chinese capital were close to the scale’s maximum of 500. The Parisian smog sparked a debate about the tax breaks for diesel, which have so dramatically influenced the profile of the French car industry. Cheap diesel has been a reality in France for 30 years. This will be a real problem for the French because diesel has now been shown to be seriously carcinogenic. However, there is nothing to indicate that this particular event was caused by diesel emissions in particular. This was a Europe-wide event, caused by still weather and car exhausts from all over the region. It would make sense that the smog in Paris could have been more dangerous because of the prevalence of diesel engines, but there has been no scientific study to prove this. The really shocking revelation from today’s audit was the graph that showed Lagos has the same amount of air pollution as Beijing. The Chinese capital’s pollution receives enormous attention and there are massive centrally-controlled programs in place to ameliorate it. But how can change occur amongst the smoggy poverty of Lagos? Where much of the pollution is caused by ancient vehicles, bad roads, unregulated industry and open incinerators.       5.41pm GMT    Paris smog: key event for European policy?    Alan Andrews from ClientEarth said: “The European Commission proposed legislation in December which aims to tackle the transboundary pollution that contributes to these kinds of smog events. However the proposal was roundly criticised for its lack of ambition, mainly because the new national limits it sets on pollution emissions won’t bite until 2030. MEPs will be discussing the EU proposal at an environment committee meeting on Wednesday. Unless they beef up the ambition level and urgency we’ll be condemned to decades more of these kinds of smogs. Air pollution ought to be one of the key environmental issues in the forthcoming EU elections. “In the meantime member states are facing court action for failing to tackle air pollution. Last month saw the Commission take action against the UK in relation to nitrogen dioxide and ratcheting up legal action against Belgium in relation to illegal levels of PM10. France was already expected to be one of the next in the firing line so this could not have come at a worse time for them. The European Court of Justice is due to hear the ClientEarth case later this year, which will have a huge bearing not just on UK cities, but also on places like Paris which are similarly projecting illegal levels of pollution until after 2020.”       5.34pm GMT    Photos from France under smog    The Guardian’s photos desk has published a series of photos documenting the pollution cloaking France.

Photograph: Philippe Desmazes/AFP/Getty Images         5.30pm GMT    Paris car ban cancelled after one day    My colleague Anne Penketh reports from Paris that the car ban has been cancelled after just one day with the government claiming it has been successful in reducing pollution.  “Bravo, and thank you,” the ecology minister, Philippe Martin, said in a message to the residents of Paris and the surrounding region as he announced that the alternating driving scheme would end at midnight on Monday. Under the emergency regulations, 700 police had been ordered onto the streets from dawn to ensure that only cars and motorbikes bearing odd-numbered plates were being driven. Martin said that 90% of Parisians had complied with the restrictions... He insisted that there had been none of the chaos feared after the last such experiment 17 years ago. By the afternoon, police had issued 3,859 drivers with €22 (£18) fines for driving with the incorrect number plates. Martin said the government decided against extending the restrictions because the weather conditions were improving and the pollution level would not breach the safe limit on Tuesday. But experts said it would take some time to determine the impact of the car ban on the pollution levels.        5.19pm GMT       Simon Birkett, director of Clean Air in London sent in a full analysis of London’s air problems and the response from the government’s alert systems, which I have published here.  “Normally, of course these days, particle levels are much higher in Beijing than Europe. However, let’s remember that scientists, policy makers and campaigners are worried about particles and gases making up air pollution. The particles are regulated as a lump for health and legal purposes i.e. all of them. In contrast, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is the only gas regulated within all the gases for modern purposes i.e. with sulphur dioxide largely eliminated by ultra low sulphur fuels. We are also worried about short-term and long-term exposure (i.e. hourly/daily or annual average) as these have different health impacts. “Average levels of NO2, a combustion gas, in London are over three times the legal limit and World Health Organisation guideline near some of our busiest streets and the highest of any capital city in Europe.”        5.17pm GMT         @guardianeco reader Helen Bird sent in this snap of Paris smog this afternoon from Tout Montparnasse. #ecoaudit pic.twitter.com/8ivIBe5Cgj&mdash; Karl Mathiesen (@KarlMathiesen) March 17, 2014      Updated at 5.23pm GMT     5.08pm GMT    Academic reaction    Gary Fuller of King’s College London and Guardian Pollutionwatch blogger tells me Beijing’s pollution generally outstrips Paris and it’s surrounding cities. “Certainly the maximum concentrations that Beijing sees in pollution episodes are far worse than we experience in western Europe,” he said. He said the recent Paris pollution had come from stagnant air building up under an unusually still weather pattern across much of Europe. Cars had been pumping nitrates into the same air for much of the week. “It’s like we are all in the same room,” he said. Sometimes European smog is caused by coal burning in eastern Europe, but analysis of the current cloud showed the problem had been caused by traffic exhausts. In Beijing, air pollution is related mostly to their coal power plants, all of which the government has undertaken to shut down by 2017. Fuller says the scientific consensus is that concentration levels are the major determining factor in air pollution health problems. With that in mind, it seems fair to say that Beijing’s air pollution is not only worse in an aesthetic sense, it’s also more dangerous. But scientists do not know which chemicals within smog make it dangerous, meaning some cities might have hidden dangers within a low pollution profile.       4.45pm GMT    London transport reaction    An adviser to London mayor Boris Johnson said:   “The Mayor takes London’s air quality extremely seriously and has implemented ambitious daily pollution tackling measures so that the capital does not need to use emergency car restrictions. We looked into similar schemes and we found these measures don’t work in the long term and can have the unintended consequence of moving problem pollution from one area to another. Instead, the Mayor has committed millions of pounds to delivering pioneering initiatives, including proposing a new Ultra Low Emission Zone and creating Europe’s largest fleet of hybrid buses to improve air quality. Nevertheless the Mayor recognises more needs to be done and is constantly looking at new ways to boost air quality and create a cleaner, greener environment.”         4.03pm GMT    London's own pollution problems    London’s AQI levels also headed into dangerous territory last week. On Thursday, the city registered an AQI reading of 160. Client Earth advisor Maria Arnold suggested that politicians were shy of issuing smog warnings because they place scrutiny on their green initiatives.  “While Paris certainly suffered higher levels, the UK seem to have managed to slip under the radar - we shouldn’t forget that for example on Thursday the London Marylebone Road monitor measured 155 for PM2.5 and that parts of the UK were 9 or 10 on the Air Quality Index. “Despite south England experiencing a serious smog event last week the UK government decided to keep pretty quiet on the subject – only posting a news item on the Defra news page and sending a tweet or two, but no smog alerts to the media which is what was needed to communicate to the wider public and make sure people could take protective measures. Indeed, ever since a press release on a predicted high pollution event got an uncomfortable amount of coverage in 2011 there have been no more. “We know that during high pollution events, more people will die from heart attacks and strokes and more people will be admitted to hospital with asthma and other breathing problems. Older people and those with pre-existing health problems are advised to reduce physical activity or even stay indoors. But in the UK way of doing things, how do these people get the message? They have to proactively sign up to a twitter feed or air text service, or check the Defra news page. It’s hardly an acceptable way to communicate to the public for something this important.”  The Kings College London Air website has just published this analysis of the London spike, which was related to the Paris event:   This is the worst PM10 episode to affect London for two years; the mean background PM10 in London reached its greatest concentrations since 15th March 2012. Tracing back London’s air during this episode shows that air flowed across northern Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium before reaching us. This is reflected in the composition of particles measured by real-time aerosol mass spectrometers in London which showed a dominance of nitrate and organic particles, consistent with distant traffic emissions that have been chemically aged in the atmosphere.

The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area was singled out as one of the worst offenders.  Annual average levels of PM2.5 - tiny pollutant particles smaller than 2.5 microns that can penetrate deep into the lungs - reached 106 micrograms per cubic metre in the region, more than 10 times the World Health Organisation’s safety limit of 10.  The WHO says the Paris PM2.5 annual average for 2008 was 22.9 micrograms per cubic metre. Coupled with the finding that the PM10 average for Paris is less than a third of Beijing’s, we have a pretty good picture of how Paris’ problem compares with the massive pollution in China.

Tens of thousands of people die prematurely in Britain every year because of poor air quality, and the EU has now launched legal proceedings over our failure to tackle it. The situation is particularly bad in London, where Boris Johnson and the UK Government have done far too little. Strong and urgent measures are needed to reduce London traffic levels if we are to end this scandal, and make it a capital city to be proud of.”  Online carpooling service BlaBlaCar said we needed to change the way we commute.   “Today’s news from Paris shows how urgently we need to reassess our car use. At the moment, it’s simply unsustainable. Just look at the cars around you in a traffic jam - the likelihood is that they’re only carrying one passenger.  “In the UK, the average car occupancy is 1.6 people per vehicle. We all expect and deserve mobility, but with seven billion of us on this planet, there’s no way we can all have our own car. That would be a catastrophe for the environment. We’re going to hit a wall unless we radically overhaul our car use”.  Caroline Allen, Green Party MEP candidate said:  “The Coalition government and London mayor Boris Johnson simply are not doing enough to protect Londoners from the killer problem that is air pollution, despite repeated warnings from the European Parliament. Every year, nearly 30,000 people in the UK and over 4,000 on London die prematurely because of air pollution – yet the issue isn’t taken nearly as seriously as it should be. “Nobody should be forced to stay indoors because of air pollution. That’s why we need to cut the amount of automotive traffic on our city centre roads and move towards cleaner transport solutions.”  James MacColl from Campaign for Better Transport said:  The example in Paris highlights what a danger car emissions can be to air quality and people’s health. We have problems with pollution in the UK too and we need innovative solutions if we are to have clean, efficient cities. We managed to get 35 per cent of Londoners to make changes to their daily travel to reduce road congestion during the Olympics in 2012 - we mustn’t lose the legacy of the lessons learned then on managing demand for car use. People need to have good alternatives to car use in cities, whether it’s walking, cycling or public transport options. In addition, the severe cuts to bus services we’re seeing throughout the UK as a result of pressures on local authorities’ spending may push people in to their cars - the Chancellor needs to use the Budget this week to put in a funding package to save our buses.

Kecha    17 March 2014 1:03pm  Some claims it comes from Germany's lignite mines, does anything support this?           2.18pm GMT    The diesel debate in France    I’m just going to come out and answer the question now. Paris does not have worse air than Beijing. It did last week and it does today. But on average it’s not even in the same industrial park. What is true is that Paris has an air pollution problem. And on a European scale it’s pretty bad.  The Huffington Post is carrying an article which traces the roots of the French pollution to the government’s post-war rural economic stimulus policies. The French aimed to encourage rural recovery (around half of the population lived in the countryside at that time) by making diesel for farm machinery and trucks cheaper. Thus, taxes levies on diesel were eased, and continue to be eased, to such an extent that the tax breaks on diesel cost the French economy almost €8 billion in 2011.  The effect on France’s car market has been dramatic. In 2011, 70% of French car sales were diesel, in Germany it was 47%. The levies are entrenched by a powerful corporate diesel lobby. Why does this matter? Because diesel creates more particulate pollution than petrol and the fumes are more damaging. In 2012, the World Health Organisation (WHO) found that diesel fumes were definitely carcinogenic. Last year the Guardian’s John Vidal reported on findings by the UK government that diesel was considerably more harmful to human health than petrol.  The [UK] government accepts that air pollution from all sources contributes to about 30,000 deaths a year in Britain. But the research estimates that diesel-related health problems cost the NHS more than 10 times as much as comparable problems caused by petrol fumes.   Diesel engines have been seen as a way to reduce carbon emissions, as they are more carbon efficient than petrol. But the recent findings have lead to questions about whether diesel is a viable transport alternative.    Updated at 2.18pm GMT     1.47pm GMT    Grumbling Parisians?    The Guardian’s Anne Penketh reports from Paris that the driving ban has been met with opposition among French commuters.  A revolutionary streak runs through French society. Rules are made to be broken, as anyone who has tried to use a pedestrian crossing in Paris knows. Parisians interviewed on Sunday said that, particularly in the case of those working in the suburbs, their car is essential for travel and they would be prepared to defy the temporary ban and risk incurring a €22 (£18) fine.  But to caricature the French as belligerent and uncaring is perhaps a little glib (dare I say anglophile). Much of the French media has been devoted to serious debate over the causes of the problems. A survey in French magazine Le Point asked more than 14000 people: Do you agree with the principle of alternating traffic? 64% said ‘non’ and 36% responded with the affirmative. Considering the impost the measure puts on commuters and the suddenness with which it was imposed, perhaps it is surprising opposition is not higher?             helen4morrissey    17 March 2014 5:14pm    A survey in French magazine Le Point asked more than 14000 people: Do you agree with the principle of alternating traffic? 64% said ‘non’ and 36% responded with the affirmative.   Bear in mind that Le Point is a pretty right-wing mag. Another interesting thing to think about is the Parisians vs suburbans difference. Many Parisians (me included) see this as the fault of those people in the suburbs with all their cars. You'd be mad (or a taxi driver) to have a car within Paris if you ask me.        Updated at 5.43pm GMT     1.32pm GMT    The air quality index    The air quality index (AQI) is commonly used by major cities around the world. It measures levels of five major air pollutants - ground-level ozone, particle pollution (also known as particulate matter), carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. According to Air Now, the AQI is separated into categories based on health concerns.   “Good” AQI is 0 - 50. Air quality is considered satisfactory, and air pollution poses little or no risk. “Moderate” AQI is 51 - 100. Air quality is acceptable; however, for some pollutants there may be a moderate health concern for a very small number of people. For example, people who are unusually sensitive to ozone may experience respiratory symptoms. “Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups” AQI is 101 - 150. Although general public is not likely to be affected at this AQI range, people with lung disease, older adults and children are at a greater risk from exposure to ozone, whereas persons with heart and lung disease, older adults and children are at greater risk from the presence of particles in the air. “Unhealthy” AQI is 151 - 200. Everyone may begin to experience some adverse health effects, and members of the sensitive groups may experience more serious effects. . “Very Unhealthy” AQI is 201 - 300. This would trigger a health alert signifying that everyone may experience more serious health effects. “Hazardous” AQI greater than 300. This would trigger a health warnings of emergency conditions. The entire population is more likely to be affected.   Paris’ levels peaked last week in the unhealthy range.     AQI levels and their health effects in brief. Photograph: @AIRNow    Air pollution is also commonly measured by the levels of particles smaller than 2.5 or 10 microns across. PM10 particles are small enough to enter your lungs and cause damage. But PM2.5 particles, generated by car exhausts in particular, are really nasty because they penetrate more deeply and are more toxic. Paris’ annual mean for PM2.5 particles is 22.9ug/m3. London is almost half this at 13.5 ug/m3. According to Air Info Now’s website:  Your lungs produce mucous to trap the particles, and tiny hairs wiggle to move the mucous and particles out of the lung. You may notice something in the back of your throat (this is the mucous); the mucous leaves the airway by coughing or swallowing. If the particle is small and it gets very far into the lungs, special cells in the lung trap the particles and then they can’t get out and this can result in lung disease, emphysema, lung cancer.      Small and large particles.

All vehicles bearing even-numbered license plates are banned from driving in French capital for the day. The restrictions were introduced after pollutions levels reached dangerous levels for five days in a row.         12.45pm GMT         The air quality in Paris is improving, @richardangwin1 has the details at 1320 http://t.co/XFgT9s9Uj9&mdash; AJELive (@AJELive) March 17, 2014         12.30pm GMT    Paris vs Beijing    The Parisian air quality index (AQI) readings for Friday were indeed high, higher even than Beijing. As they are again today according to environmental risk specialist Arshad Bhat.     Paris air quality index: 87 and Beijing is 76, NewYork is 33, Delhi is 89 and this is PM2.5 system classification @KarlMathiesen&mdash; Arshad Bhat (@abhat) March 17, 2014    But, commenter johnai points out, the peak of 185 on Friday is still a long way from the highs in Beijing in February, which approached the 500 mark.             johnai    17 March 2014 11:49am  This is the highest reading I could find for Paris. http://aqicn.org/city/france/paris/autoroute-a1-saint-denis/ Compares to 76 for Beijing (currently 7:45pm China time).  So Paris (one specific road) is higher than Beijing, but both are pretty low compared with the readings of 500+ that made the news for Beijing previously.      A comparison of the average air pollution of these cities (recorded by the World Health Organisation) shows clearly (excuse the pun) that any given day in Beijing is likely to be far more polluted than Paris. More than most cities in the world in fact. Lagos being a notable exception. The data from the WHO is based on measurements of particulate matter smaller than 10 microns (PM10) rather than the AQI quoted above (I’ll get into the difference later).

She says the driving ban has not noticeably reduce traffic on the roads.  The smog-cloud is far less visible today but the air quality remains very poor. I’m still coughing from the morning school-run (ten minute cycle each way) four hours ago. My daughter, aged 8, has been coughing and sneezing and wheezing for the past week. There are still the same number of cars on the road as on an average Monday and the general consensus amongst my neighbourhood Parisians is that all in confusion - not enough information, alternate days based on number plate ‘odd and even’ unenforceable and the fine - 22 euros - not nearly enough to deter anyone. As a quote from an interview in the popular free morning daily paper ‘20 Minutes’ points out this morning - ‘Pay 22 euros or miss a day’s pay from missing work? The choice is obvious.’ I haven’t seen one police officer checking cars and they can’t possibly carry out the threat to clamp parked vehicles as they have no proof if they were driven-in today or not. With free transport, one-hour free electric car scheme hire and free Velib bicycles - still, no-one’s listening. And lots of non-driving residents are very angry indeed.        11.36am GMT       Still conditions have left the cloud of pollution hanging over much of Europe. 30 of France’s 90 départements have recorded dangerous levels of air quality. These images show how little the situation changed between Friday and Sunday.

On Friday, Paris’ air quality index (AQI) rose to 185, higher than the world’s most notoriously polluted cities, including Beijing. The AQI measures fine particulate matter in the air. Measurements below 50 are considered normal. Over 150, pollution becomes dangerous to human health. Jean-Paul Huchon, head of the Paris’ transport administration STIF, said that due to the “significant risks to the health of residents... I am asking all residents in Paris and neighbouring areas to favour the use of public transport”. French Ecology Minister Philippe Martin said air quality was “an emergency and a priority for the government”. Reports from France say more than 3000 drivers have been fined already this morning. The driving ban, based on alternating odd and even number plates, is a commonly used technique for reducing pollution during emergencies in major cities. An alternating ban was used in Paris once before in 1997. According to the BBC, Paris air quality monitoring body Airparif said the measure hard “a noticeable impact” on air quality, although these findings have been disputed.
