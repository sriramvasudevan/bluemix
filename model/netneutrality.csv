"Telecoms lobbyists have filed a brief in a lawsuit that includes nearly every major industry player demanding that the Washington DC court of appeals vacate net neutrality rules ordered by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in February.  Chief among the objections of the United Telecom Association (UTA) is that their members won’t invest as heavily in broadband infrastructure if they are forced to abide by the new regulations, contravening the FCC’s mandate to encourage investment. One of the plaintiffs in the joint brief, the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, said in a blogpost on Thursday that it had always supported “reasonable” net neutrality. The FCC reclassified internet providers under Title II of the Communications Act, making them common carriers subject to the same regulations as public utilities. “Unfortunately,” the NCTA said, “the FCC went well beyond that sensible mission and chose to impose an outdated, far-reaching and punitive regulatory model on today’s dynamic Internet.” The net neutrality rule is “arbitrary and capricious”, according to the UTA’s brief. “Worse, the Order willfully disregards the destructive effects of reclassification on hundreds of billions of dollars in investment-backed reliance interests that the FCC’s prior light-touch approach deliberately induced,” UTA lawyers wrote. This is in contrast to statements by Fran Shammo, CFO of Verizon, which has some 9.2 million US subscribers, at a UBS Bank telecoms industry conference in December 2014. “To be real clear, this does not influence the way we invest,” he said in answer to a question about the coming change to Title II regulation.  “I mean we’re going to continue to invest in our networks and our platforms, both in wireless and wireline FiOS and where we need to. So nothing will influence that. I mean, if you think about it – look, I mean we were born out of a highly regulated company, so we know how this operates.” (Shammo also added that the regulations would result in “a very litigious environment”.) The NCTA said its own record on net neutrality as a concept was solid. “Cable providers have invested billions of dollars into building, maintaining, and improving an open Internet experience for our customers,” the organization’s statement said. “And even without formal net neutrality rules on the books, our industry embraced core Open Internet principles since they were first floated in the 1990s – and we continue to live by those principles today.” Evan Greer, campaign director of internet activist group Fight for the Future, disagreed with that assessment. “I think it’s outrageous for companies that have spent tens of millions of dollars trying to undermine the public will on this issue claim that they’ve always supported net neutrailty,” she said. “In recent years they’ve used it as a buzzword, but they’ve always pushed for policies that allow for a two-tiered internet that allows for fast lanes. That is the opposite of net neutrality.”",2015-07-30T23:14:53Z,Telecoms lobbyists rail against 'arbitrary and capricious' net neutrality rules,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""63508148e82c6546da97c51d9b5c5a88f8882b29""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/63508148e82c6546da97c51d9b5c5a88f8882b29/0_0_5400_3239/1000.jpg"" alt=""An internet IT server area"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The National Cable and Telecommunications Association said the FCC ‘went well beyond’ reasonable action.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>",0,Brief filed as part of lawsuit demands court vacate Federal Communications Commision’s decision to regulate internet carriers as public utilities,http://media.guim.co.uk/63508148e82c6546da97c51d9b5c5a88f8882b29/0_0_5400_3239/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/30/telecoms-lobbyists-net-neutrality-regulation-arbitrary-capricious,9,negative
"Net neutrality rules will go into effect on Friday, after a federal court rejected a bid by cable and telecommunication companies to stay the rules while a lawsuit challenging them is pending. “This is a huge victory for internet consumers and innovators!” Tom Wheeler, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said in a statement. “Starting Friday, there will be a referee on the field to keep the internet fast, fair and open.” “Blocking, throttling, pay-for-priority fast lanes and other efforts to come between consumers and the internet are now things of the past. The rules also give broadband providers the certainty and economic incentive to build fast and competitive broadband networks.” The fight for an open internet is far from over, however.  “I plan to fight the order all the way to the supreme court,” said Daniel Berninger, founder of the Voice Communication Exchange. At the end of February, the FCC approved a 313-page order that would allow it to treat internet access like a public utility. Cable and telecommunication companies objected, saying the order was an overreach by the FCC and that such rules should be created by Congress.    Related: FCC's net neutrality rules challenged in lobbyist lawsuit    By mid-April, a handful of lawsuits had been filed against the FCC, seeking to overturn the net neutrality rules. The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) filed one such suit; so did the National Cable and Telecommunications Association (NCTA) and the US Telecom and the American Cable Association.  “I am pleased that the FCC’s Open Internet Order and strong rules to ensure there are no slow lanes on the internet become effective tomorrow,” said Mignon Clyburn, a FCC commissioner, on Thursday.  “A free and open internet is vital to our democracy and competitive market. I am proud to stand up for the consumer to protect free speech and a free market.” Not everyone at the FCC was as thrilled. Ajit Pai, one of the two Republican FCC commissioners who voted against the plan, said he was disappointed with the court’s decisions. He added that the “development was not unexpected”.",2015-06-11T22:51:55Z,Net neutrality rules to go into effect after court rejects bid to block them,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-57589273-89b7-421e-b7e7-57b21c342385""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434056753319/79681323-c183-434f-954b-b1006e74c677-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Net neutrality protest"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Rally to Save the Internet in July in California. <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/freepress/14557082400/"">Photograph: Free Press/flickr</a></span> </figcaption> </figure>",1,"In what FCC chairman Tom Wheeler calls ‘a huge victory,’ the rules will go into effect Friday despite a handful of lawsuits challenging them",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434056753640/733e3d9d-51ee-42e8-b6e2-0d6db46c8ff9-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/11/net-neutrality-lawsuit-federal-court,9,negative
"India has been in the throes of a long-gestating debate on net neutrality – the principle that all data on the internet should be treated equally. This began in March, when the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) authored a consultation paper proposing a regulatory framework for over-the-top (OTT) internet services such as WhatsApp and YouTube. The consultation, which closed in April, ignited debate on a wide range of policy issues, including concerns about privacy, security and consumer awareness. In the eye of the storm is Airtel Zero, a recently launched platform that allows customers to access mobile applications at zero data charges, akin to a toll-free number where cost is shifted from the caller to the company. However, not everyone is convinced. Indian e-commerce company Flipkart pulled out of Airtel Zero over public protests against abuse of net neutrality principles and consumer choice. The wave of public outcry was supported by a number of pro-consumer advocates, including Bollywood celebrities and the comedy group, All India Bakchod.   Related: Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn offer new ways for advertisers to reach users    Meanwhile, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg continues to insist that Facebook’s own Internet.org service does not abuse net neutrality and is aimed at providing access to those communities in India where even basic internet is unavailable. While the vast majority of consumers in India are in favour of net neutrality, telecom companies are on the other side of the fence, wishing to have greater flexibility to determine how data travels over their networks. It’s not difficult to guess why – an entirely “neutral” internet limits their prospective revenues from bandwidth-hungry OTT services – and, after all, the network infrastructure needed to support these services is not going to build and maintain itself. A sign of things to come? However this plays out in India, a specific net neutrality law in the country may set a precedent for other countries in Asia. In emerging markets, the “splinternet” question remains unanswered – that is, will services such as Internet.org lead to multiple parallel internets, each offering only a limited bundle of services? In that respect, the internet ends up looking more like the traditional cable TV bundle, something that net neutrality advocates are desperate to avoid. Governments and incumbent operators in these emerging markets will find themselves having to balance the need to connect the “unconnected” with the fact that the quickest path to doing so may involve tie-ups with commercial operators, which may then wish to exert a level of control over the services that users can access. In all markets, wider and faster connectivity will in turn drive the rapid growth of OTT services and, in particular, the relatively bandwidth-hungry online video services. 2015 is already being described as the year of online video, with Netflix making its first move into Asia and regional ventures such as iFlix and HOOQ (a joint venture between Singtel, Warner Bros and Sony) rolling out. More content and services, and more users, means added pressure on network infrastructure and on ISP business models, and that makes it increasingly likely that those ISPs will look to enter commercial arrangements with the OTT operators. The ISPs themselves are moving further into content production and distribution, which, in the view of the pro-neutrality camp, is likely to create a dangerous conflict of interest. In a world where ISPs operate both the pipes and the content services, some consider it inevitable that those ISPs will favour their own offerings over those of their competitors, thereby skewing the market and creating barriers to entry.   Related: Advertising industry wages war on bots to combat online ad fraud    Meanwhile, all of these developments need to be viewed in the context of the race to be the Silicon Valley of Asia. Governments are keen to create ecosystems that are favourable to technology and digital media startups – and the pro-neutrality camp argues that it will be impossible for startup OTT businesses to compete without net neutrality rules. However, governments need to balance this goal with the need to maintain a favourable environment to protect the legitimate business interests of more established local and international companies. Whatever happens in India, the still hotly debated questions there are equally applicable to every major market in Asia, from the highly developed markets such as Singapore and South Korea to emerging markets such as Myanmar. Some governments are taking the position that their existing quality-of-service and competition rules sufficiently address the issue. However, the net neutrality question isn’t going away and it seems a safe bet that we will see some kind of specific net neutrality regulations in Asia before long. The outcome of this debate will likely shape the way that users in Asia engage with the internet for years to come.

"At the 2014 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Jan Koum, chief executive of WhatsApp, made an announcement that would cause much unease 4,000 miles away in New Delhi. “We want to make sure people always have the ability to stay in touch with their friends and loved ones really affordably,” he said. “We’re going to introduce voice on WhatsApp in the second quarter of this year.”  India’s telecom operators were less than enthusiastic about this announcement.. With more than 70m users in India, the instant messaging platform has emerged as one of the most popular alternatives to conventional text messaging – enough to make telecom operators jittery.  It isn’t surprising then that at the same event, India’s telecoms operators made it clear that they wanted a revenue-sharing agreement with internet companies. They believed that services such as WhatsApp’s voice-calling feature would potentially cut the revenue generated by voice calls and text messages.  In essence, telecom operators wanted the internet to be mouldable, to be shaped in any way they liked. After all, India is one of the world’s fastest-growing internet markets, with 851m connections according to Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) figures .  Telecom companies know this and profit from the internet services they provide to mobile phone users. For instance, major Indian networks like Airtel added 7.46m 3G internet connections, Vodafone 11.4m and Idea Cellular 7.1m in the past four quarters, according to Medianama.com. Yet they want greater control of how people use the internet on mobile phones. On 27 March, the telecoms regulator released a “consultation paper” in which it made a series of recommendations to deal with the growth of internet services and apps. The key cornerstones of this 118-page minefield of legalese and jargon advocate the licensing of internet companies, along with killing the network neutrality that exists in India today.  ‘Pay up or be throttled’ Nikhil Pahwa, editor of Medianama.com, says: “Either you will have licensing of all internet companies if they want to be available in India – whether those companies are operating out of India or abroad. Or the same rules [that govern telecom companies] will apply to anything that involves any form of communication such as messaging or voice. So any service which uses either voice or messaging will need to buy a licence.”  The regulator also recommended that internet companies register themselves with telecom operators to ensure smooth service delivery to users. “So effectively, there would be a splintered version of the internet, where one part will be that companies become vendors of telecom operators. For that, they’ll have to pay and [in return] they will receive certain privileges,” Pahwa explains. “Those who don’t pay for these privileges will then be throttled or they will be made more expensive – or they may be blocked.”  That means a telco like Airtel could sign a deal with WhatsApp, offering it for free and slowing down, blocking access to or increasing the price of Apple’s iMessage service or similar third-party apps such as WeChat. As this was a public consultation paper, Indians were asked to give their views on its recommendations to the telecoms regulator by 24 April. Pahwa and a group of like-minded friends saw an opportunity to prevent control of the internet being handed to the big telcos. Soon after the consultation paper was released, Pahwa became part of a coalition of more than 50 artists, journalists, techies and lawyers who started Save The Internet – an online campaign that urged Indians to send in their suggestions of ways to preserve net neutrality to the regulator . They created a list of answers to the 20 questions the regulator posed in its consultation paper that users could copy, paste and email to it in just three clicks. Initially, public response was muted, but all that changed on 11 April, when AIB, a popular comedy troupe, made a video simplifying network neutrality and highlighting how the regulator’s recommendations could have an adverse effect on internet usage in India. The strategy seemed to have been inspired by Jon Oliver’s 13-minute sketch that urged Americans to visit the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) website and demand net neutrality. Like its American cousin, this strategy too was successful.      The Indian comedy troupe AIB produced a YouTube video highlighting the importance of net neutrality. Photograph: YouTube    By the time 24 April arrived, 1.1 million Indians (including this writer) had emailed the TRAI, urging it not to license what it called “over-the-top”, internet-based services, nor to give telecom operators the legal sanction to start “zero-rating” plans – or charging different prices for different services.  Media companies such as NDTV, Times Internet and NewsHunt, as well as travel portal Cleartrip, all announced that they were leaving Internet.org, Facebook’s controversial effort to offer selective internet access to those hitherto without it. Tathagata Satpathy, an MP from the Biju Janata Dal party of Orissa, wrote a strongly worded letter of dissent to the telecoms regulator , saying that its recommendations would allow “big companies to form monopolies over the mobile web”. But the consultation paper of March was only one step in a concerted effort by telecom operators to fundamentally alter the way Indians use the internet. In December 2014, the website TelecomTalk reported that Airtel had started charging users an additional amount for calls made via apps like Skype and Viber, over and above the data packs they had subscribed to. Once Airtel’s violation of network neutrality was revealed, the company backtracked and said it would wait for the regulator’s consultation paper.    Related: Can the internet be saved without harming democracy?    “I read this differently from most people,” Pahwa recalls. “Most people said that ‘users have won’ because consumers had asked for this to be withdrawn. My reading was that the only reason why it had been withdrawn was because the TRAI agreed to do a consultation. In effect, it had been forced to do a consultation.”  In January 2015, Medianama also reported that Rajan Mathews, director general of the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), had written a letter to TRAI chairman Rahul Khullar in December 2014, asking for WhatsApp to be licensed – a demand that became a “recommendation” in the regulator’s consultation paper. So why did TRAI act in the manner that it did? We made multiple attempts to reach its representatives but no one was available to respond. Cost of access The global definition of net neutrality stops at advocating an internet that is equal for all. But in the Indian context, there is an additional dimension – zero-rating services. That refers to consumers’ data packs being subsidised either by their telecom service providers or by the app/service they are accessing. For instance, Flipkart, the Indian e-commerce giant, signed a deal with Airtel to “zero-rate” its services on Airtel’s platform.  The deal was severely criticised for creating an unequal playing field. While Flipkart could afford to pay Airtel, a smaller start-up would not be able to. Once the net neutrality debate in India gained momentum, Flipkart decide to scrap this arrangement. “In India, zero-rating is far more important because it isn’t about slow lanes and fast lanes,” explains Pahwa. “It’s about cost of access and whether some sites are being made cheaper than others and, therefore, some sites being made more expensive than others. All of this influences a consumer’s decision whether to access a service or not.”     Indian online retailer Flipkart signed a controversial access deal with mobile operator Airtel. Photograph: Flipkart    For their part, the COAI claims that it too believes in giving users equal access to the internet and not throttling traffic. How, then, does it justify its members offering zero-rating services? “It’s a misunderstanding of what Airtel did,” says the COAI’s Mathews. “Airtel provided a non-discriminatory platform to anybody who wanted [it] as an application provider. This is not for regular customers. It’s only for qualifying applications to put them on mobile networks and the internet. So what Airtel did was provide free access to service providers. There was no discrimination and it was equal.”  In its counter-comment submission to the telecoms regulator, the COAI has asked for zero-rating services to stay in the interest of “social welfare”. “Programs like zero-rating, which we call subsidised calling plans, are intended to get people who have never used the internet, who have not become familiar with it, who have very sensitive price points [to], in a subsidised manner, try to come on to the internet,” adds Mathews.  The COAI has also argued that services like WhatsApp are the same as regular voice calls and text messaging and thus deprive mobile operators of revenue. Hence, they argue they should be allowed to charge users extra to access such apps. On both counts, the industry body seems on shaky ground.  Not a luxury but a necessity In its counter-comment submissions to the TRAI, Medianama.com has said that Airtel, Vodafone, Reliance and Idea, India’s top four telecom operators, have added 8.5 million users. Moreover, Airtel’s average revenue per user (ARPU) from data services increased by a record 13.3% quarter-on-quarter. Data revenue for Idea Cellular rose 5.9%. This unprecedented campaign to protect net neutrality in India underlines the importance of the internet. For millions of young Indians today, the internet is not a luxury but a necessity. In a country rife with political, social and economic inequalities, the web is a liberating universe that flattens hierarchies, creates room for innovation and allows unadulterated and totally free expression of speech. It is a reason why some of India’s most successful startups also have called for the internet to be kept neutral. What also helped was a sustained effort by the Save The Internet coalition, during which they turned TRAI’s 118-page minefield into a 23-page easy-to-comprehend document. (According to Pahwa, India’s MPs have chosen to read this rather than the original paper). In Bangalore, his colleague Kiran Jonnalagadda helped run the Save The Internet website and set up the @bulletinbabu Twitter account – a live counter of emails sent to the regulator. They also drafted a letter citizens could send to their local MPs, urging them to support net neutrality. “These consultations are only public for the name of it,” Pahwa added. “They’re not public consultations – we helped make this a public consultation.”  Will the next Angry Birds come out of India ",2015-05-25T12:55:34Z,How people power took on big business in the fight for net neutrality in India,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""7afd7e58eebf16e4a602a2dfa14ab552d27797f7""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432550772614/903a9039-4625-4210-a8ff-85e0be52af07-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""India is one of the world's fastest-growing mobile phone markets."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">India is one of the world’s fastest-growing mobile phone markets.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",3,"When Indian mobile operators tried to charge extra for messaging apps like WhatsApp, a grassroots campaign for a free internet was mobilised ",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432550772973/903a9039-4625-4210-a8ff-85e0be52af07-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/25/india-net-neutrality-people-power,0,positive
"Two major lobbying groups are hitting back hard at new net neutrality rules meant to protect an open internet, both headed by former commissioners for the regulator that passed the rules.  The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA), a wireless industry lobbying group run by former Federal Communications Commission commissioner Meredith Attwell Baker, on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against the FCC seeking to overturn the regulator’s landmark net neutrality rules on the grounds that “the FCC usurped the role of Congress” in creating them.  The suit joins a similar filing from the National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assocation (NCTA), run by Michael Powell, formerly the chairman of the FCC under GeorgeW Bush. When the rules were passed, Powell observed that consumers will immediately “bear the burden of new taxes and increased costs” as a result of member organizations passing on any costs associated with net neutrality to consumers. The NCTA is bringing in heavy hitters, as well: its suit will be handled by former US solicitor general Theodore Olson and former assistant to the US solitictor general Miguel Estrada.  A smaller group, the American Cable Association, also filed suit Tuesday. The new lawsuits join yesterday’s filing by another lobbyist, USTelecom. The board of CTIA is composed of executives from companies including Verizon, Microsoft, Samsung, Motorola, AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile and US Cellular. The board of the NCTA, which is run by Michael Powell, himself a former chair of the FCC, includes execs from Comcast, Cox, Charter, Time Warner Cable, Cablevision and Disney. Baker, in particular, has ties to the lobbying community and the government that run deep, especially around direct regulatory action: in 2011, she left the FCC to work as senior vice-president of government affairs for Comcast, barely four months after the regulator had approved that company’s purchase of a majority stake in entertainment conglomerate NBCUniversal. Baker, an Obama appointee who served less than two years on the commission, was a strong voice in favor of the merger’s approval. Writing on the CTIA blog, Baker wrote that she was “confident that the courts will reject the FCC’s overreach for the third time, particularly with respect to mobile broadband services.” The “third time” to which Baker referred counts previous rulings against the FCC, notably this same court’s ruling last year that cable networks couldn’t be classified “common carriers”, a crucial aspect of the law. The language of the CTIA suit seems to agree that “carefully-tailored rules to protect internet openness will allow investment and innovation to continue to flourish”. Its further contention, however, is that the rules privately determined to be most beneficial to the consumer by its members are the only rules necessary, pointing out that the trade association’s standards are “[i]nformed by the views of nearly 4 million commenters, our staff-led roundtables, numerous ex parte presentations, [and] meetings with individual Commissioners and staff”. The FCC’s net neutrality ruling, while popular with consumers and video producers like Netflix, is controversial and, some analysts say, on dubious legal grounds until thoroughly tested by lawsuits just like this one.  “Net neutrality can’t stand legally,” said Rich Greenfield of BTIG. “There are going to be heavily contested battles, and even if [it does, the rules] don’t get into the question of so-called ‘managed’ services.”  Either way, Greenfield says, with respect to the way carriers privilege – or don’t – certain kinds of content, “there are concerns that companies like Netflix and Dish and many others still have”, even if net neutrality passes muster with the courts.",2015-04-14T19:32:09Z,FCC's net neutrality rules challenged in lobbyist lawsuit,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""1d43d0d2a584265e5c610eea890bf943a2fac34b""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/1d43d0d2a584265e5c610eea890bf943a2fac34b/0_273_3044_1828/1000.jpg"" alt=""The FCC’s net neutrality ruling, while popular with both consumers and video producers like Netflix, remains controversial."" width=""1000"" height=""601"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The FCC’s net neutrality ruling, while popular with both consumers and video producers like Netflix, remains controversial.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Karen Bleier/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",4,Two groups headed by former FCC commissioners claim watchdog ‘usurped the role of Congress’ in passing new rules to protect an open internet,http://media.guim.co.uk/1d43d0d2a584265e5c610eea890bf943a2fac34b/0_273_3044_1828/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/14/fcc-lobbyists-net-neutrality-internet,6,negative
"Netflix has been accused of hypocrisy after it revealed it had teamed up with Australian ISP iiNet to obtain preferential treatment despite being a long-time proponent of net neutrality. The news comes as it attempts to explain seemingly contradictory statements from its own chief financial officer, who told a media and technology conference that the company wasn’t pleased with the US Federal Communications Commission’s decision to regulate the internet as a “Title II” public utility, akin to telephone lines. Netflix will launch in Australia and New Zealand on 24 March, ending the situation where customers in those countries were forced to use virtual private networks (VPNs) to access the service semi-legally. But, as part of the launch, the video-on-demand company is pairing with iiNet in order to offer its service to the ISPs customers without impacting on their broadband caps, something which seems counter to its longstanding support of net neutrality – the principle that ISPs should treat all internet services equally. Usage caps on iiNet’s tariffs begin at 100GB per month, and rise to 1TB, with fees of $0.60 (£0.31) for every gigabyte used over the limit. With HD streaming clocking up more than 100MB every minute, even a moderate Netflix user could go over the cap with ease – which explains why the company is eager to make a deal. Netflix’s head of business development, Paul Perryman, said that “working with iiNet to offer quota-free Netflix content gives more people the opportunity to familiarise themselves with who we are and what our service offers”. But in 2012, the company’s chief executive expressed a very different view on broadband caps. That year, Reed Hastings wrote on Facebook that “Comcast should apply caps equally, or not at all. “If I watch last night’s SNL episode on my Xbox through the Hulu app, it eats up about one gigabyte of my cap, but if I watch that same episode through the Xfinity Xbox app, it doesn’t use up my cap at all. “The same device, the same IP address, the same Wi-Fi, the same internet connection, but totally different cap treatment.” Netflix explained the discrepancy to The Verge with a statement: “Zero rating isn’t great for consumers as it has the potential to distort consumer choice in favor of choices selected by an ISP. We’ll push back against such efforts, but we won’t put our service or our members at a disadvantage.” But a day later, the company was facing a new charge of hypocrisy, after chief financial officer David Wells told a technology conference that the company wasn’t too happy with the FCC’s decision to mandate that broadband internet be treated as a Title II utility, severely limiting providers’ ability to affect the traffic they carry over their cables. “Were we pleased it pushed to Title II? Probably not,” Wells told the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media &amp; Telecom Conference. “We were hoping there might be a non-regulated solution.” But in 2014, the company had filed a brief with the FCC arguing that “Title II provides a solid basis to adopt prohibitions on blocking and unreasonable discrimination by ISPs. Opposition to Title II is largely political, not legal.” In an effort to explain the discrepancy, a Netflix spokesperson told Recode that Wells was “trying to convey the evolution of our position on net neutrality in recent years”. The company said it “supports the FCC’s action last week to adopt Title II in ensuring consumers get the internet they paid for without interference by ISPs. “There has been zero change in our very well-documented position in support of strong net neutrality rules.” But the explanation didn’t come in time to prevent the telecoms firms laying into the streaming service. AT&amp;T’s Jim Cicconi released a statement excoriating Netflix: “Netflix has spun a lot of tales during this FCC proceeding. But it’s awfully hard to believe their CFO would go into a major investor conference and misspeak on an issue supposedly so crucial to their future.  “More likely he had an attack of candor. At least until his company’s lobbyists got hold of him. I’m sure they’ll also have some terrific spin to explain Netflix’s data cap deal in Australia.” EU doubles back While the net neutrality debate is more or less settled in the US, after the FCC’s intervention, in the EU, it’s just getting started. And the latest proposal, from the council of ministers, has “managed to alienate almost everyone with a stake”, according to industry news site The Register. The council’s proposal bans certain forms of traffic management, preventing ISPs in the EU from blocking specific content, or even slowing it down. But it retains language that allows providers to offer “specialised services”, seen by net neutrality proponents as little more than a euphemistic term for an internet fast lane. Dutch MEP Marietje Schaake led the signatories of an open letter that called on the ministers to “ensure consumers are protected, innovative startups can develop, and competition on the open internet is fair”. At the same time, ETNO, the pan-European industry group for telecoms firms, also criticised the proposal. “Any future regulation must recognise how networks function,” the organisation said in a statement. “We need balanced rules on traffic management as well as measures that allow the development of specialised services and innovative offers.”",2015-03-05T12:12:14Z,Netflix in row over net neutrality support,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""2d940a2fa01b4b8c34c864929cc5f94fc79a0d55""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/5/1425554535534/30710513-6903-466b-9f3b-073b9582e836-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Kevin Spacey and Michael Kelly appear in a scene from Netflix's hit drama ""House of Cards."""" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Kevin Spacey and Michael Kelly appear in a scene from Netflix’s hit drama “House of Cards.”</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Melinda Sue Gordon/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>",5,"As streaming service teams up with Australian ISP for preferential treatment, it’s forced to clarify US executive’s comments on broadband caps<br>",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/5/1425554535813/30710513-6903-466b-9f3b-073b9582e836-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/05/netflix-row-net-neutrality-support-australia,6,negative
"The US’s top media regulator hit back at critics of new net neutrality rules voted into law last week, comparing them to the first amendment and saying neither government nor private companies had the right to restrict the openness of the internet. The Federal Communications Commission chairman, Tom Wheeler, was speaking in Barcelona at Mobile World Congress, the world’s largest telecoms trade show, just as European governments are meeting to thrash out their own principles for keeping the internet open.“This is no more regulating the internet than the first amendment regulates free speech in our country,” Wheeler said. “If the internet is the most powerful and pervasive platform in the history of the planet, can it exist without a referee? There needs to be a referee with a yardstick, and that is the structure we have put in place. A set of rules that say activity should be just and reasonable, and somebody who can raise the flag if they aren’t.” Telecoms companies across Europe and America have railed against Wheeler’s reforms, saying they will discourage investment in better cable and wireless networks and simply benefit bandwidth-hungry services like Netflix and YouTube, which do not normally pay for their content to be carried across the internet. In the US, Verizon and AT&amp;T, the two largest mobile operators, have said they will try to reverse the new rules in the courts. Meanwhile, Wheeler told conference attendees in Barcelona: “Those who were opposed to the open internet rules like to say this is Depression-era monopoly regulation. We built our model for net neutrality on the regulatory model that has been wildly successful in the US for mobile.” The FCC rules will treat telecoms companies in a similar way to utilities such as electricity. Internet service providers will be explicitly prohibited from blocking, throttling or prioritising internet traffic for commercial reasons. Where complaints are raised, the FCC will decide on a case-by-case basis whether what network owners are doing is “fair and just”. The FCC has said it would not intervene areas such as pricing, network unbundling and technical operating requirements. The European parliament is in the midst of negotiations with member states and network operators over final net neutrality rules, which could be published later this spring. A source at one of Europe’s largest mobile carriers said the fear was that Europe would introduce similar rules, only to find itself out of step when the FCC is forced to back down by a legal challenge or a change of president. Barack Obama was elected on a promise to preserve net neutrality and has been a staunch supporter of the new rules. But America will elect a new president in 2016 and Republicans have rallied against the regulation. The chief executives of Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom said on Monday at Mobile World Congress that they should be allowed to prioritise the delivery of data for future services like heart monitors or connected cars, where an interrupted signal could compromise safety. “We favour net neutrality, but we need to be allowed to have quality classes to enable new services in the internet of things,” said Deutsche Telekom’s chief executive, Tim Höttges. Proposals put forward by the Latvian presidency of the European Council, leaked to the Financial Times, suggest corporate and individual customers should be able to pay for faster internet services, although these could not be allowed to impair other internet traffic in any “material manner”. The proposals would enshrine a principle of net neutrality but allow network owners to shape the flow of traffic. Any suggestion of a two-speed internet will be fiercely resisted by open-internet campaigners. But European executives are not convinced such developments would be banned in America. Vodafone boss Vittorio Colao told journalists on Monday: “I have asked explicitly to the chairman of the FCC, ‘So, are specialised services, fast lanes and quality of service forbidden or not?’ The answer is no, they are not forbidden. We understand that they will be there. Are they explicitly authorised? No, they are not. “Americans are great pragmatists so they will do what is right.”",2015-03-03T20:29:30Z,"Net neutrality is like free speech – and the internet needs rules, says FCC boss","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""8679dbc5ab5af6a9b8cd7c27bf33b7c792572b5a""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/8679dbc5ab5af6a9b8cd7c27bf33b7c792572b5a/0_0_5184_3110/1000.jpg"" alt=""network cables"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The FCC chairman, Tom Wheeler, said of net neutrality at a Barcelona telecoms trade show that ‘activity should be just and reasonable’.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Michael Bocchieri/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",6,Tom Wheeler tells the world’s largest telecoms trade show ‘there needs to be a referee’ even as European officials propose fast lanes that don’t impair traffic,http://media.guim.co.uk/8679dbc5ab5af6a9b8cd7c27bf33b7c792572b5a/0_0_5184_3110/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/03/net-neutrality-free-speech-fcc-tom-wheeler,9,negative
"Net neutrality campaigners took to the skies to declare victory over cable companies by flying a “grumpy cat” meme banner over the headquarters of Comcast, the nation’s biggest internet provider. Open internet activists flew a plane carrying a 2,000sq ft banner reading: “Comcast: Don’t mess with the internet” with an image of a popular grumpy cat and the hashtag #SorryNotSorry.  The aerial victory parade in Philadelphia came the day after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved a plan to govern broadband internet like a public utility, and prevent cable companies from offering preferential access to the internet to those that pay more.  “This is a victory of the internet, by the internet, and for the internet,” David Segal, executive director of Demand Progress, one of the biggest net neutrality campaign groups, said. “Comcast and cable allies spent big for the right to degrade the very service they provide to their customers, and they tried to ignore the millions of public comments in support of net neutrality.  “But they can’t ignore the FCC’s vote yesterday – or a plane flying over their corporate headquarters today. This banner is a message from the millions who stood up to one of the most powerful special interests in Washington: you can’t ignore the internet. We won at the FCC and we’re ready to fight the ISPs and defend net neutrality in the streets and in the air, in Congress and in the courts. And we will win.” The campaigners were integral to generating large scale public support for the net neutrality rules. FCC chairman Tom Wheeler – a former telecom lobbyist turned surprise hero of net neutrality supporters – thanked the 4 million people who submitted comments on the new rules. “Your participation has made this the most open process in FCC history,” he said yesterday [Thursday]. “We listened and we learned. “The internet is simply too important to be left without rules and without a referee on the field,” he added. “[The] order is more powerful and more expansive than any previously suggested.” The grump cat victory came shortly after Republican FCC member Ajit Pai, who opposed net neutrality, invoked Star Wars’s evil galactic emperor Palpatine in a fresh attack on the regulations. Pai said: “Young fool … Only now, at the end, do you understand.” The battle between the two sides was quickly dubbed a meme war.

"Republicans invoked Star Wars’s evil galactic emperor in their attacks on new broadband regulations on Friday, warning that the public and Silicon Valley were in for an unpleasant surprise. Quoting Emperor Palpatine, Republican Ajit Pai, a member of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), said: “Young fool … Only now, at the end, do you understand.”   Related: Net neutrality activists score landmark victory in fight to govern the internet    Meme wars between the two sides of the debate continued through the day, as internet advocates Fight for the Future, Demand Progress and Free Press flew an airplane towing a 2,000 square foot banner over the towering corporate headquarters of the cable giant Comcast, in Philadelphia. The victory banner depicted the feline internet star Grumpy Cat and the legend: “Comcast: Don’t Mess With the Internet. #SorryNotSorry.” Referring to Pai’s comments Evan Greer, campaigns director at Fight for the Future, said: “What they didn’t know is that when they struck down the last rules we would come back more powerful than they could possibly imagine.” Pai and fellow Republican FCC commissioner Mike O’Rielly, who have been consistent critics of the FCC’s new rules, said once they are published people will realise that they will stifle innovation and lead to taxes and increased rates for the public. “When you see this document, it’s worse than you imagine,” said O’Rielly at a conference in Washington organised by the think tank TechFreedom. The FCC on Thursday voted through strict new rules to regulate broadband and protect net neutrality – the principle that all information and services should have equal access to the internet. The historic vote was cheered by internet activists, President Barack Obama and many in the tech community. However, few people have seen the actual orders. On Friday the FCC was finalising its documentation for publication – it it is not expected to release the orders until next week at the very earliest. Pai said the new rules would mean “permission-less innovation is a thing of the past”. The new rules will ban broadband providers from creating fast lanes for some or slowing the traffic of others for commercial reasons. They will also give the FCC the power to police conduct by broadband providers on a case-by-case basis. Internet service providers will not be allowed to “unreasonably interfere with or unreasonably disadvantage” consumers’ access to content and services. O’Rielly said this would mean that any company looking to start a new service would have to seek permission ahead of time. He said anybody looking for new business opportunities in the document would be best off becoming a “telecoms lawyer”.",2015-02-27T19:08:33Z,Republicans strike back: FCC member invokes Star Wars in net neutrality fight,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""b42abdffd93297ca2c44d69f418d2f754cae5b9f""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/27/1425061656768/8acad8cc-8a4a-4c7b-979d-76a917a68943-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Emperor Palpatine"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Emperor Palpatine.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>",8,"Republican Ajit Pai quotes Emperor Palpatine, of Star Wars’s evil galactic empire, in attack on new broadband rules regulating the internet",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/27/1425061656900/b41f49b3-e523-4a63-98bf-1ebfbb846c1e-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/27/republicans-strike-back-fcc-member-star-wars-net-neutrality,9,negative
"Verizon took to morse code and a faux-typewriter to express its frustration over new rules to open up the internet on Thursday, as Republicans and big cable lobbyists lined up to lambast net neutrality protections as unworkable, unfair and unconstitutional. Verizon issued its coded statement after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to impose tough new laws on broadband companies under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, an act from “the era of the steam locomotive and the telegraph”, Verizon dashed and dotted. The FCC was forced to rewrite its old rules after Verizon successfully challenged the regulator’s authority in court last year. Now that the new rules have arrived, new challenges – of the legal, political and creative public-relations variety – have already begun. In a statement, also released in text form, albeit in typewriter font, Michael Glover, Verizon’s senior vice-president, public policy and government affairs, said: “Today’s decision by the FCC to encumber broadband internet services with badly antiquated regulations is a radical step that presages a time of uncertainty for consumers, innovators and investors.”    .@Verizon doesn&#39;t give a font. #NetNeutrality #FCClive http://t.co/Nu08lnMf6T pic.twitter.com/IrJYXV0d8T&mdash; dominic rushe (@dominicru) February 26, 2015    His concerns were echoed by the US cable industry’s largest lobbying group, the National Cable and Telecommunications Association. The NCTA said the new broadband rules would hurt “everyday broadband users” by raising costs and reducing investment.  Michael Powell, president of the NCTA – and a former FCC chairman – told Fox News that the current chairman, Tom Wheeler, had been pressed into introducing the rules by “unprecedented” pressure from Barack Obama. Under the new rules, internet providers will be blocked from creating “fast lanes” that could give a competitive advantage to certain services. Nor will they be allowed to slow traffic for commercial reasons. The FCC will also have the power to intervene if it feels internet providers have invented a new way to challenge net neutrality – the principle that all information and services should get equal treatment online.   Related: Net neutrality: Republicans to strike back against Obama's 'internet grab'    The FCC’s two Republican commissioners voted against the broadband proposals and have filed objections that will delay the release of the regulatory body’s 300-plus-page report. Wheeler said the report would be issued soon. Once it is filed, internet service providers are expected to sue. Republicans in Congress are also making moves to have the orders thrown out. Matt Wood, policy director at the advocacy group Free Press, said the new rules should be easier for the FCC to defend in court. “That’s the difference between these rules and the last ones, frankly: there is a very good chance they will stand up in court.” Opponents disagree. “Today’s FCC votes resolve nothing,” said Berin Szoka, president of the libertarian think tank TechFreedom. “The FCC is bound to lose in court on much or all of its plan to remake broadband into a heavily regulated service – or, even better, a government-run monopoly.  “Unfortunately,” Szoka continued, “neither chairman Wheeler nor President Obama seems to care two figs about the legal details, which will be fought over well into the next administration.”",2015-02-26T21:58:07Z,Verizon and big cable lash out at net neutrality rules – using morse code,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""e3dc89701a3f2150c6dfc4eefd14ea261c81ac10""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/26/1424988623999/5642c185-08e1-4a00-91f4-27e36289cc8b-460x276.png"" alt=""Morse code on Verizon's website"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Verizon’s morse code statement on the net neutrality ruling.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>",9,Telecoms giant uses a faux typewriter and morse code to issue statement expressing frustration at what it calls ‘antiquated’ internet regulations,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/26/1424988624458/4b74d47a-d893-4a0f-be00-a4d6a14f5b54-140x84.png,http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/26/verizon-big-cable-net-neutrality-morse-code,5,negative
"  2.30pm ET    FCC passes net neutrality rules     The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) passed historic new rules that give the body its greatest power over the cable industry since the internet went mainstream. Cable companies will not be allowed to offer “fast lanes” on the internet and access but be equal for all users.  “No one should control free and open access to the Internet,” FCC chairman Tom Wheeler said. “It’s the most powerful and pervasive platform on the planet. The Internet is too important to allow broadband providers to make the rules.” FCC voted in favour of overturning state laws that ban municipalities from expanding independent broadband coverage.         2.23pm ET       Verizon has accused the FCC for imposing “1930s rules on the internet” in a statement written in morse code.  “Today’s decision by the FCC to encumber broadband Internet services with badly antiquated regulations is a radical step that presages a time of uncertainty for consumers, innovators and investors,” it said in a ‘translated’ statement.        1.09pm ET       Our man in the room, Dominic Rushe, says.

Cable companies lost their bet that millions spent on lobbying to stifle competition was a wiser investment than extending high-quality Internet to our nation’s entrepreneurs, students and rural families.“Preventing big Internet Service Providers from unfairly discriminating against content online is a victory, but allowing communities to be the owners and stewards of their own broadband networks is a watershed moment that will serve as a check against the worst abuses of the cable monopoly for decades to come.” The FCC decision sets an historic precedent for towns working to offer municipal broadband networks in twenty states that have enacted limits or bans on local governments building, owning, or even partnering to give local businesses and residents a choice in high speed Internet access.

The FCC does not have the legal authority to override the decisions made by Tennessee and North Carolina. Under the law, it is up to the people of those two states and their elected representatives—not the Commission—to decide whether and to what extent to allow municipalities to operate broadband projects. Today’s Order is therefore unlawful. This decision violates the constitutional principles that lie at the heart of our system of government. The FCC is treating Tennessee and North Carolina as mere appendages of the federal government rather than the separate sovereigns that they are. For all of these reasons, I dissent.        10.43am ET       The main event isn’t until a bit later on, first up is a vote on whether or not to allow the expansion of municipal broadband. Local governments in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Wilson, North Carolina, have built their own fast networks, which has angered cable companies.

"Internet activists scored a landmark victory on Thursday as the top US telecommunications regulator approved a plan to govern broadband internet like a public utility. Following one of the most intense – and bizarre – lobbying battles in the history of modern Washington politics, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) passed strict new rules that give the body its greatest power over the cable industry since the internet went mainstream. FCC chairman Tom Wheeler – a former telecom lobbyist turned surprise hero of net neutrality supporters – thanked the 4 million people who submitted comments on the new rules. “Your participation has made this the most open process in FCC history,” he said. “We listened and we learned.” Wheeler said that while other countries were trying to control the internet, the sweeping new US protections on net neutrality – the concept that all information and services should have equal access online – represented “a red-letter day for internet freedom”.  “The internet is simply too important to be left without rules and without a referee on the field,” said Wheeler. “Today’s order is more powerful and more expansive than any previously suggested.” Barack Obama – who had pushed for the regulations – praised the decision and thanked the people who had protested for tighter rules. “I ran for office because I believed that nothing can stand in the way of millions of voices calling for change. That’s the backbone of our democracy–and you’ve proven that this timeless principle is alive and well in our digital age.So to all the people who participated in this conversation, I have a simple message: thank you,” the president wrote. But Republicans and cable companies were quick to attack the move. The National Cable and Telecommunications Association said the rules would hurt “everyday broadband users” by raising costs and reducing investment. Broadband providers will be banned from creating so-called “fast lanes” blocking or slowing traffic online, and the regulator will oversee mobile broadband as well as cable. The FCC would also have the authority to challenge unforeseen barriers broadband providers might create as the internet develops.   Related: Net neutrality: FCC overrides laws preventing municipal broadband expansion – live    Activists and tech companies argue the new rules are vital to protect net neutrality – the concept that all information and services should have equal access to the internet. The FCC’s two Republican commissioners, Ajit Pai and Michael O’Rielly, voted against the plan but were overruled at a much anticipated meeting by three Democratic members on the panel. Republicans have long fought the FCC’s net neutrality protections, arguing the rules will create an unnecessary burden on business. They have accused Obama of bullying the regulator into the move in order to score political points, with conservative lawmakers and potential 2016 presidential candidates expected to keep the fight going well into that election campaign. Pai said the FCC was flip-flopping for “one reason and one reason only: president Obama told us to do so”. Wheeler dismissed accusations of a “secret” plan as “nonsense”. “This is no more a plan to regulate the internet than the first amendment is a plan to regulate free speech,” Wheeler said. “This is the FCC using all the tools in our toolbox to protect innovators and consumers.” Obama offered his support to the rules late last year, following an online activism campaign that pitched internet organisers and companies from Netflix and Reddit to the online craft market Etsy and I Can Has Cheezburger? – web blog home of the Lolcats meme – against Republican leaders and the cable and telecom lobbies. Broadband will now be regulated under Title II of the Communications Act – the strongest legal authority the FCC has available. Obama called on the independent regulator to implement Title II last year, leading to charges that he unduly influenced Wheeler’s decision that are now being investigated in Congress. Broadband providers hit back immediately. The National Cable and Telecommunications Association said the rules would hurt “everyday broadband users” by raising costs and reducing investment.  “Today’s decision by the FCC to encumber broadband Internet serviceswith badly antiquated regulations is a radical step that presages a timeof uncertainty for consumers, innovators and investors,” said Michael Glover, Verizon’s senior vice-president for public policy and government affairs.  To illustrate what Verizon saw as the FCC’s old-fashioned thinking, the company put out its news release in typewriter font and dated it 1934. The release also went out in Morse code.    .@Verizon doesn&#39;t give a font. #NetNeutrality #FCClive http://t.co/Nu08lnMf6T pic.twitter.com/IrJYXV0d8T&mdash; dominic rushe (@dominicru) February 26, 2015    Before the meeting on Thursday, a small band of protesters gathered in the snow outside the FCC’s Washington headquarters, in celebration of their success in lobbying for a dramatic U-turn in regulation. Wheeler and his Democratic colleagues, Mignon Clyburn and Jessica Rosenworcel, were cheered as they sat down for the meeting. Joining the activists outside was Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, who said the FCC also needed more power to prevent future attacks on the open internet. “We have won on net neutrality,” Wozniak told the Guardian. “This is important because they don’t want the FCC to have oversight over other bad stuff.”    .@stevewoz outside #NetNeutrality vote. @FCC needs power to stop &quot;bad stuff&quot;. pic.twitter.com/Vv1nOiZB0d&mdash; dominic rushe (@dominicru) February 26, 2015    Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world wide web, addressed the meeting via video, saying he applauded the FCC’s decision to protect net neutrality: “More than anything else, the action you take today will preserve the reality of a permission-less innovation that is the heart of the internet.”  “It’s about consumer rights, it’s about free speech, it’s about democracy,” Berners-Lee said. Clyburn compared the new rules to the Bill of Rights. “We are here to ensure that there is only one internet,” she said. “We want to ensure that those with deep pockets have the same opportunity as those with empty pockets too succeed.” The fight for net neutrality has been largely fought online. The millions of messages were sent to the FCC during its comment period on the rules before Thursday’s landmark series of votes. Last year the FCC looked set to approve rules that would have allowed internet service providers to create “fast lanes” on the internet. Critics charged such a move would create a two-tiered internet and stifle competition. Tiffiniy Cheng, co-founder of internet advocacy group Fight for the Future, said: “This is our free speech struggle in the digital age. Institutions of power should know by now: internet users will not stand idly by while anyone tries to take their freedom away.” The FCC passed two new orders on Thursday. The first, equally controversial but eclipsed by the net neutrality debate, overturned bans on municipal broadband companies competing with private cable firms. Municipal broadband companies in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Wilson, North Carolina, pushed for the expansion plans, against which private cable and telecom rivals have been lobbied intensely. Twenty US states currently have limits or bans on local governments building, owning or partnering with others to give local businesses and residents a choice in high-speed internet access. That vote, too, fell along party lines, potentially opening many US cities to wider competition. Voting for the municipality change, Clyburn said millions of people had been left in “digital darkness” because cable companies did not want to expand in their areas. The Republican commissioners, O’Rielly and Pai, called the change “appalling” and “un-constitutional”.  “Unfortunately for the Commission, all the lipstick in the world cannot disguise this pig,” said Pai. Christopher Mitchell, director of community broadband networks at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, said Thursday’s vote could set “an historic precedent” that could “profoundly impact the lives of three-quarters of Americans who are without broadband or a choice in their service because of big cable underinvestment in their towns”. The FCC was forced to rewrite its broadband rules after Verizon successfully challenged its authority to stop it creating fast lanes or to more broadly regulate the industry under its last set of regulations, the Open Internet Order of 2010. Legal challenges for the new rules are also inevitable. “When internet users come together to fight for something they believe in,” said Fight for the Future’s Cheng, “nothing can stop them.”",2015-02-26T18:00:33Z,Net neutrality activists score landmark victory in fight to govern the internet,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""1d43d0d2a584265e5c610eea890bf943a2fac34b""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/1d43d0d2a584265e5c610eea890bf943a2fac34b/0_273_3044_1828/1000.jpg"" alt=""Protesters hold a rally at the FCC headquarters in Washington to support net neutrality."" width=""1000"" height=""601"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Protesters hold a rally at the FCC headquarters in Washington to support net neutrality.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Karen Bleier/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",11,"FCC says ‘we listened and we learned’, and passes strict broadband rules that represent ‘a red-letter day for internet freedom’",http://media.guim.co.uk/1d43d0d2a584265e5c610eea890bf943a2fac34b/0_273_3044_1828/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/26/net-neutrality-activists-landmark-victory-fcc,5,positive
"Net neutrality is the principle of making sure that your internet service provider doesn’t make it easier for you to access one service over another – the Guardian over the Telegraph, say – or otherwise distorting your use of internet services just because someone dropped a few extra quid in their pocket. Yet in many ways, the current battle over net neutrality is less a question of broad, public-interest internet values, and more a parochial telecommunications policy war between US cable and content companies, waged on a global stage.  After more than a decade of wrangling, on 26 February an executive board of US telecommunications regulator the FCC will vote on a 322-page proposal, titled Preserving the Open Internet. Matters of deep principle are claimed to be at stake, but agreement on what those principles are is less forthcoming.   Related: Only net neutrality can protect the internet from becoming like TV: white, middle-class and exclusive    The internet is not unlimited Nobody can object to aspirations such as neutrality, equality and openness. But each of these terms is also a conceit. The internet is not unlimited. Traffic management, in some form or another, is obligatory in shipping digital packets. When you make a phone call, your voice is sampled maybe 50 times a second, and then reconstituted at the receiving end, with a minuscule delay to account for any network failings.  When you call up an internet application or website, that site or service is hurled at you, progressively increasing as many packets as the network can carry, unless something else gets in the way. If voice gets in the way, the application adapts. If it’s the other way around, voice drops out.   Related: Net neutrality battle pitches activists and FCC against Big Cable and GOP    Network engineer Fred Baker uses this distinction between voice and web, or between “real-time” and “elastic” applications, to demonstrate one of the consequences of a rigid application of net neutrality rules. If everything must be treated equally, he argues, then nothing can be done about your voice line dropping. You are subject to the internet service provider’s best efforts – “passing your traffic to the enemy, and hoping for the best”. With voice, this is usually fine – we can cope with some small delay. With video and other data-rich streaming, it becomes more complicated. Is there only one form of net neutrality? In the first order, net neutrality is the Telegraph/Guardian example: ensuring that internet service companies don’t intentionally block or degrade access to legal content or services. At this level, there is little controversy. Rules against such practices are welcome, even if there is little evidence that it is a market problem requiring fixing.  One of the damaging side-effects, nevertheless, is that a crude assessment of legality could unfairly prevent the bulk of upstream traffic and a significant proportion of downstream traffic in many parts of the world that is comprised of peer-to-peer file sharing. Second-order net neutrality is about the voice/web challenge – the detail of traffic management – and it’s much harder. In particular, there is a heated debate over paid prioritisation, or “fast lanes”, negotiated between ISPs and content providers. Here, the market is already active. Streaming companies such as Netflix have complex “peering” arrangements with cable companies to fund good service and make up for some of the vast percentage of the cable traffic Netflix uses.  Another area where such arrangements are manifold is mobile, and the meat of the FCC proposal focuses on these issues. But it is not clear whether it is just about ensuring public-interest oversight of peering arrangements, or actually interfering with the arrangements that can be made. Either way, the US now seems to recognise that public regulation of bandwidth, to ensure the public interest is met, is the appropriate foundation for such regulation, bringing it into line with the rest of the world.   Related: Cord cutters on net neutrality:  'It would be the end of wild wild west of the internet'    What this debate doesn’t solve Net neutrality has been the central campaign point for a grassroots movement of internet activists in the US. It has an obvious bad guy in the fat cat cable companies, but it’s as much about the incredibly consolidated and monopolistic US telco landscape, and the geoeconomic aversion to internet regulation, as it is about wider, public interest internet issues. The rather extraordinary thing is that over-the-top services – the content providers – have come off as the white knights. Just like artists and struggling musicians are the frontmen of the industry copyright lobby, here, start-ups and bloggers are the frontmen to the internet giants. In the end, however, we’re all small fish to Facebook, Google, Amazon and their kin. Net neutrality is no panacea to walled gardens, tethering, transit providers that exploit exchange-point congestion, and content-delivery networks that outpace the speed of light in giving me access to Google and Amazon quicker than the Guardian or the Greek national library. Your access to a small newspaper or voice application, is slow not because of shady service provider deals, but because of the enormous network infrastructure and network entrenchment of its competitors. We citizens, often derogated as “users” or “consumers”, have much to win in a global communication space. That is much more than simply a “neutral network”. Instead, it is a truly open, distributed network where everyone’s fundamental rights are respected. Not having our access providers acting as interested gatekeepers may be a step in the right direction, but it is by no means an end. Many other distortive factors remain and we will not have an open space until we get rid of them all.",2015-02-26T12:36:15Z,Net neutrality is only the beginning of an open internet,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""7dc46eda71ad49b61f2bd50b923918d6d42984c9""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/26/1424953885742/1fb018a2-b73d-46f3-8d6d-f53557f0594c-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Data difference …  Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright in Netflix drama, House of Cards.

They will overrule the two Republican commissioners who have already lambasted the plan and will hold their own press conference later in the day.

"The future of the internet is about to be decided. Will it continue to be a place where dreams are born, dissent is protected, and democracy thrives? That depends on a crucial net neutrality vote at the Federal Communications Commission on February 26. Internet Service Providers want to break the internet into fast and slow lanes that sell public voice to the highest bidder. If we lose that vote, the most democratic communications platform the world has ever seen could become more like cable TV, a fairly scary place that reproduces the economic gaps and racial hierarchies of the offline world. A year ago, when a DC circuit court struck down the first round of hard-won net neutrality rules, the court’s decision charged its proponents with the daunting task of persuading the FCC to reclassify broadband as a common carrier, under Title II of the Communications Act. This would give net neutrality rules the legal under-pinning needed to be enforceable. Standing in the way was an army of telecom lobbyists, and the millions of dollars spent by the telecom industry to sway congress and a handful of DC insider civil rights organizations. A visionary cohort of civil rights leaders refused to have their positions on network neutrality bought, sponsored, or sold.  Many spoke up. Like Representative John Lewis, who said, “Every voice matters, and we cannot let the interests of profit silence the voices of those pursuing human dignity”. And the co-founders of Black Lives Matter, whose powerful defense of the internet as a platform for social change reverberated from Capitol Hill to Silicon Valley. 21st century groups that use the open internet to fight for fair policing, to end mass deportation, and win fair wages on sites like Colorofchange.org or Presente.org also raised their voice on this issue, along with their partners in the Media Action Grassroots Network. Their views, once obscured by corporate gatekeepers, can now reach audiences directly, in their own words, at unprecedented speeds. When the openness of the internet came under attack, these civil rights activists stood up, and fought back. The net neutrality rules proposed by FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler would not only protect those organizing for change, but also help close long-standing equity and wealth gaps that disadvantage communities of color and America’s poor. From ensuring access to quality education and health care, to strengthening opportunity for independent artists and small businesses, equal representation in a digital economy and 21st century democracy demands net neutrality protections. Despite the clear benefit that net neutrality protections offer to under-served communities, Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon have continued to propagate myths in an effort to thwart the fight for an open internet. Fortunately for the American people, net neutrality remains on the table at the FCC, despite the industry’s best efforts. This is largely due to the homegrown activism by local leaders rooted in communities that have the most to lose if the FCC votes against net neutrality. From the low-income students in Philadelphia asking Comcast to pay its fair share, to activists of color organizing #DontBlockMyInternet marches in San Antonio, the SF Bay Area, Champaign-Urbana, New York,Albuquerque and more - under-served internet users are making it very clear that they want rules that keep the internet a level playing field, and they want them now. If the rumors are true, it looks like these activists, and the over 4 million people who advocated for strong net neutrality rules, might just get the protections they’ve been waiting for. The open internet is the first and only mass communications platform to allow under-served communities to bring injustices once in the shadows to light, and speak truth to power. That’s why if the FCC protects internet users with strong network neutrality rules this week, I will be among those clapping and crying for joy. Though the struggle for equal communication rights and access is far from done, an open internet gives those without traditional power the tools to plead our own cause - and that is something worth fighting for.",2015-02-26T11:30:01Z,"Only net neutrality can protect the internet from becoming like TV: white, middle-class and exclusive","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""30522e4a71b39056fbb71aa58af1b7bdfa62d65a""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/25/1424908203397/44237af6-0ead-4069-a9f7-8248cb38d2b0-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""FCC"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Let’s not go back there</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Lambert/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",14,The internet gave marginalized groups a voice.

"Later this week, a Jumbotron will arrive outside the Washington DC offices of the Federal Communications Commission. The giant screen being erected by internet activists at OpenMedia will broadcast messages calling on the regulator to keep standing up for strong rules to protect an open internet. But this is not so much a protest as an early celebration, complete with a gif, a Lolcat and a proclamation: WE CAN HAZ NET NEUTRALITY? The animated cats have almost certainly won this round. But as net-neutrality activists know, it won’t be long before the Republicans strike back. On Wednesday, the most vocal congressional committee will start to investigate claims the FCC has been railroaded into voting through new rules governing the broadband industry after undue pressure from the president. The hearing of the House oversight committee will begin before the regulators’ landmark vote on Thursday because, by now, the result is a foregone conclusion: the FCC is now committed to protecting net neutrality – the concept that all information and services should be entitled to a level playing field online. But hearings are just the beginning of a series of attacks on the FCC’s proposals likely to build momentum ahead of the 2016 election. Republicans are convinced that Democrats aim to paint them as enemies of a free internet – and having lost ground, they are launching an early campaign of their own to win back the debate. According to Greg Walden, the Republican chairman of the House communications and technology subcommittee, the FCC has been bullied into supporting the open regulations by an Obama administration intent on using a hot-button issue for political gain. Walden’s investigation follows reports in the Wall Street Journal that the White House set up a “shadow FCC” (codename: Obamanet) in the months leading up to Thursday’s vote. This secret task force was charged with building a case to regulate broadband under Title II of the Communications Act – the toughest set of rules available to the FCC that give the regulators utility-like jurisdiction over broadband in the future. “The closer we get to the FCC rubber-stamping President Obama’s internet grab, the more disturbing it becomes,” Walden said in a statement announcing the hearing. A general outline of the new net-neutrality plans has been disclosed, but so far just a handful of Washington insiders have seen the details. By Friday, the FCC’s two Republican commissioners will be free to give their detailed objections to the proposals. They are preparing to blow holes in the outline, highlighting legal issues that will be seized on instantly by Title II’s vociferous opponents. The two commissioners, Ajit Pai and Michael O’Rielly, have fought to have the released ahead of the vote. “With the future of the entire internet at stake, it is imperative that the FCC get this right. And to do that, we must live up to the highest standards of transparency,” they wrote in a statement.  Their internet-activist opponents support the transparency, but critics charge the move is an attempt at further delaying the long-anticipated FCC vote. In the meantime, Republican senator John Thune is working on a bill that would trump the FCC’s plans, with the broadband industry lining up to sue.  Michael Powell, the chairman of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, has called Title II a “fatal step”, and pushed back on Obama’s call in November for the FCC to make the “strongest rules possible” in protecting net neutrality. Powell’s powerful lobby group has intimated likely action after it sees the more specific FCC new rules.     Activists lobbied against the plans to create ‘fast lanes’ for customers who could pay more. Photograph: Free Press/flickr    For some on the right, however, this Thursday’s FCC vote is more about the 2016 election than net neutrality. They charge politics was the real reason that Obama stepped into a debate that has consumed potential voters that may not fall into typical Democrat or Republican territory. “There’s never been an issue like this where the president has taken such an active roll,” said Berin Szoka, president of the thinktank TechFreedom. “They are making this an issue that they can keep milking politically.” Szoka was one of the panelists at an Lincoln Labs’s Reboot Congress conference earlier this month in Washington. Lincoln Labs, a libertarian technology lobby group, pulled in an all-star gathering of Republicans – including likely presidential candidates Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Carly Fiorina – for the conference at the US Chamber of Commerce. At the meeting, Senator Thune said Title II is a “terrible” idea. On stage, Szoka won a round of applause after he told Nick Grossman, the general manager of tech investor Union Square Ventures that Title II was the last thing his industry needed. “We could resolve all of these issues in Congress,” said Szoka. “If your community had spent a fraction of the time pushing for a legislative solution or had the president asked for one, we’d be done.” With the current timing, a court case – or a congressional battle – could be reaching a peak just as the 2016 midterms campaigns begin in earnest. So far Republicans have fared badly in the net neutrality debate.  There is a whiff of sour grapes. One telecoms lobbyist, speaking anonymously, said the net neutrality debate had been hijacked by the left and Democrats smarting after their midterm election defeat. The White House has made “a cynical political calculation that this is an opportunity to reinvigorate the net roots base”, the lobbyist told the Guardian.  “They lost them on Snowden. This is an easy call.”  But Republicans – and their supporters in the business community – believe they have a fighting chance on net neutrality. Outside the Chamber of Commerce’s imposing Hall of Flags this month, Garrett Johnson – a Lincoln Labs founder and a former special assistant to another presidential candidate, Florida governor Jeb Bush – said that once the details of the orders were out, opponents would have more to work with and he was confident of winning support in the tech community. “I don’t think the tech community is fully on board with the idea of giving a Washington bureaucracy a blank cheque to decide how the internet is managed,” Johnson said. “The end result will be more regulation and less innovation.” It’s been over a year since the courts effectively overthrew the FCC’s authority to regulate broadband internet. The case, brought by Verizon, came after a series of skirmishes with broadband providers, but left a deep a split in the industry. Many cable operators were happy (enough) with the old regulatory regime – the Open Internet Order of 2010 – and feared that vacating the old rules could pave the way for tougher ones. And so it came to pass. While the FCC licked its wounds and worked on new rules, internet activists organised a mesmerisingly effective lobbying campaign in support of Title II. The campaign spurred president Obama into action and triggered a U-turn from the FCC, which only last May was proposing a “hybrid” solution that would have allowed the broadband companies to create high speed fast lanes for some paying clients. That proposal elicited howls of protest across the internet and from companies including Etsy, Netflix, Reddit and others which charged that it would end net neutrality and make it impossible for new companies, without access to fast lanes, to compete. Senator Ted Cruz summed up what appeared to be the Republican position on the debate with a tweet late last year:    &quot;Net Neutrality&quot; is Obamacare for the Internet; the Internet should not operate at the speed of government.&mdash; Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) November 10, 2014    What a difference a few months make. Most of Cruz’s colleagues are now on board for “net neutrality”. Thune’s proposals would also ban fast lanes and prevent broadband firm’s from “throttling” – slowing down – services. Now they have to convince a sceptical public. Republicans face an uphill battle, Szoka insisted, beginning Thursday.  “Most of all because net neutrality sounds like mom and apple pie. Nobody can be against it,” he said. “The real fight has become about legal authority, which is what it always has been.”",2015-02-24T18:32:24Z,Net neutrality: Republicans to strike back against Obama's 'internet grab',"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""4a218a1e9279b596438e95e02941dd60871e43d0""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/24/1424800845800/1774182a-5e33-4c9b-9352-11270ebfa17c-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Net neutrality"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Republicans say the FCC has been bullied into supporting the open regulations by a politically motivated Obama administration.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Free Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>",15,"On Thursday, the FCC votes on whether to accept tough new rules to regulate the internet.

"Q: What is net neutrality? Net neutrality is the principle that all legal content and applications should have equal access to the internet, without being favored or blocked by internet service providers. Q: Why is it in the news? On Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) will vote on new rules to regulate broadband that have proved to be the hottest issue the regulator has ever faced. More than 4 million people – a new record – submitted comments to the FCC as it considered its options and Barack Obama called on the regulator to impose the “strongest rules possible”. Activists are calling Thursday’s meeting “the most important FCC vote of our lifetime”. Q: What is the FCC proposing? Tom Wheeler, chairman of the FCC, is proposing to protect net neutrality by imposing strict new rules on internet service providers under Title II of the communications act. The FCC would be given the legal muscle to:  Prevent broadband providers from banning any legal service or website. Outlaw “paid prioritization” – fees for faster service. Ban “throttling” – impairing or degrading internet traffic.  The rules will apply to wireless and wired services and dramatically expand the FCC’s power to regulate the industry. Q: What is wrong with the current system? There isn’t one. Internet service providers have sued the FCC on a number of occasions, challenging its regulating authority. In January, Verizon successfully challenged the FCC’s authority to prevent the company from creating “fast lanes” or slowing or blocking selected web traffic. Broadband has been effectively unregulated for over a year.  Q: Will it pass? Almost certainly. Wheeler is one of three Democrats on the five-member commission, all of whom support his proposals. The two Republican commissioners will object but will be overruled. Q: Who supports the proposals? Alongside Obama, a broad coalition of internet activists and tech companies including Google, Facebook, Netflix, Mozilla, Etsy and Reddit have backed Title II regulation. They argue that without strong regulation, cable companies could “pick the winners” online, providing better service for their own offerings or those of preferred clients than for rivals. Such a move would stifle innovation online, they argue. Q: Who objects? Verizon, obviously, AT&amp;T and the cable industry, and the Republican Party. Republican senator John Thune has accused the FCC of giving in to “bully tactics” and called its proposals “terrible”. Both critics and proponents argue that Title II is akin to regulating the internet like a utility such as water or electricity. The objectors argue the burden of regulation will hamper innovation and discourage investment. Wheeler has sought to assuage their fears by proposing to “forbear” more stringent utility rules. The FCC says it will not, for example, impose price restrictions or force cable companies to share their networks. Cable companies say there is no guarantee that a future FCC will abide by those forbearances.  Q: What happens next? Broadband providers are lining up to sue the FCC as they have in the past. FCC officials have said they are confident they can defeat a legal challenge, but their opponents will not give up without a fight.  Meanwhile Thune is drawing up legislation that, while it would enforce most of what the FCC is proposing, would limit the regulator’s authority over the broadband industry.

"Every morning as Carla Astudillo gets ready for work, she puts on the news. But instead of turning on the TV, Astudillo’s headlines come to her from her computer. Astudillo is a cord cutter and she’s not the only one. About 7.6m US households no longer get cable. From 2010 to 2014, the number of cord cutters – those who have decided to forgo life with cable and opted to get their TV and news on the internet – increased by 44%. It is a seismic shift that has helped trigger the largest cable merger in history, Comcast’s proposed takeover of Time Warner, and is at the heart of the fierce row being fought out in Washington over new rules to protect net neutrality – the concept that all legal content and applications should have equal access to the internet.   Related: FCC's net neutrality proposal to treat high-speed internet like public utility    Many cable cutters are paying little attention to the clash of the titans. For them it’s about cost and convenience. But you can bet that the titans are paying attention to them. Astudillo, a 27-year-old data journalist for NJ Advance Media, canceled her cable in 2012. Back then, even with cable channels at her disposal, she increasingly found herself watching shows on Hulu and Netflix. The two services made the transition easier. Of course, the $30 to $40 that she now saves each month didn’t hurt either.  Right now, she pays $59 a month for her Optimum internet connection and $7.99 a month for a Netflix account she was paying for anyway. She is considering upgrading to Hulu Plus, which would cost her an additional $7.99. She says she has given little thought to how an end to net neutrality will affect her internet and TV-watching habits. She is, however, worried about the future of open internet and innovation that brought us services such as Netflix. “I feel like it would be the end of wild wild west of the internet, innovation and all of these good things,” she said. Most consumers have remained blissfully unaware of the net neutrality debate or how its outcome might affect them. Broadband’s regulator the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) received a record 4m comments on its open internet proposal spurred on internet activists and aided by John Oliver. But in 2013, 74.4% of all US households told the Census bureau that they had internet. Four million is just a small fraction of that.   Related: 'Awe-inspiring' FCC internet protections could alter landscape for net neutrality    “I don’t pay enough attention to [the net neutrality debate], honestly,” says Lauren Pavin, a 32-year-old coffee shop manager in Baltimore. She and her boyfriend are on the cusp of cutting the cord. This past Christmas, Pavin received Apple TV as a present. They already subscribe to Netflix and are just waiting for HBO to provide a stand alone service, before their do away with their cable bill. “Between [HBO] and Netflix, that’s all we watch,” she said. Her cable and internet subscription with Comcast costs Pavin about $140 a month. Even after cutting the cable, she might have to stay with Comcast, as that’s the company that services the majority of the Baltimore area. Pavin has little hope that net neutrality will fix her internet troubles. “I wish the connection was faster but ... it’s Comcast. It’s a terrible internet service in general,” she says. In the six months that she has lived in Baltimore, she has experienced monthly internet outages.     Comcast: not exactly a favorite among consumers.  Photograph: Matt Rourke/AP    Cutting the cord may sound like you’re hurting Big Cable but the money they lose on one end they make back at the other. Time Warner’s cable subscriptions have been declining for years and its revenue from video subscriptions drops millions of dollars a month. The upside is that the company’s high speed internet subscriptions are going up faster than its cable subscription was going down – making up for all the losses. After intense lobbying by proponents net neutrality rules likely to be voted through this week will mean the cable firms can not slow online services or offer fast lanes to others. The regulations are meant to maintain a level playing field that should allow new video services to woo cable cutters just as Netflix and Hulu have in the past. But those rules are already under attack from some Republicans and will be subject to an immediate challenge from the cable industry, which argues the FCC has gone too far.   cable map promo   And in the meantime cable cutters bemoaning their lack of choice face an even more consolidated market. If the Comcast/Time Warner deals goes through, according to the FCC’s measures some 63% of US consumers will only have one choice of broadband provider. Proponents of net neutrality like Neil Hunt, chief product officer at Netflix, have previously bemoaned the lack of competition among internet service providers. “The reality in this country is that we don’t really have competition for which cable provider you really get your broadband from,” Hunt told the Guardian last year. And as such, if companies like Netflix want to reach consumers in all parts of the US, they have to find a way to work with the particular providers servicing those individual areas. The net neutrality debate will enter a new phase this week – but it won’t end here. Not long from now the FCC will decide whether or not to allow Comcast to takeover Time Warner. While cable cutters may feel they are reshaping an industry, close inspection suggests the industry is still very much in control. Cable companies are “absolutely worried about the changing environment”, says Bruce Leichtman, president and principal analyst at Leichtman Research Group. “But – for the cable specifically – while they are worried about losing TV subscribers, they also are the providers of broadband service. So, if someone is going to get Netflix or Hulu, they are going to need broadband service and that, in the majority of places, is the cable company.”",2015-02-22T13:54:26Z,Cord cutters on net neutrality:  'It would be the end of wild wild west of the internet',"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-50595d5b-caf7-44c0-ae83-06e8c8486284""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/9/1423512819998/f5fe3700-0398-471a-8650-9a8efce4e0ce-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Net neutrality protest"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Obama in the Backseat: Rally to Save the Internet in July in California.

"Proposing a titanic legislative shift on net neutrality after a years-long push from internet activists, the head of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is preparing to push through “the strongest open internet protections ever”. “The internet must be fast, fair and open. That is the message I’ve heard from consumers and innovators across this nation,” FCC chair Tom Wheeler wrote in an editorial for Wired magazine published on Wednesday. “The proposal I present to the commission will ensure the internet remains open, now and in the future, for all Americans.” Wheeler’s proposals – to all but reclassify the internet as a public utility – come after the FCC has received more than 4m public comments on its proposals, the biggest overhaul of US regulation of the internet since the presidency of George W Bush.   Related: Obama will fundamentally reshape the internet. But he hasn't said how | Trevor Timm    The new rules will be sent to the regulator’s commissioners on Thursday, before a crucial vote at the end of the month. While the FCC has the support of president Barack Obama, the proposals have stoked Republican ire about over-regulation and will face intense lobbying from the cable industry in the coming weeks. FCC officials, speaking on background, said the new rules would:  ban blocking, preventing broadband providers from blocking access to legal content, applications or services; stop throttling, preventing broadband providers from degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; outlaw paid prioritization, preventing broadband providers from favoring certain internet services with so-called “fast lanes” or from prioritizing the content and services of their affiliates.  Activists hailed the decision as “historic”, while critics called Wheeler’s proposals “unjustified, overblown”. Wheeler is set to press for broadband internet to be regulated under Title II of an overarching communications act. Under Bush, broadband was classified as an “information service” and escaped the regulatory burden associated with telecommunications, which are considered a utility. The shift would give the FCC far greater powers to step in and act if it spots potential broadband abuses – and hand the FCC oversight of mobile broadband, a fast growing area, for the first time. However, officials said the FCC would not set prices or force cable companies to share their networks and would “forbear” parts of the act they believe would hamper innovation. Last May, Wheeler proposed regulating broadband under Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act, a move supported by the cable companies. Such a policy shift could have allowed cable operators to create “fast lanes” for some users in return for higher fees – a move critics charged would kill “net neutrality”, the concept that all traffic should be treated equally online. While Section 706 only allows fast lanes that are “commercially reasonable”, Wheeler wrote in Wire that he became concerned “that this relatively new concept might, down the road, be interpreted to mean what is reasonable for commercial interests, not consumers.” Wheeler said he now believed the FCC needed to use Title II to protect an open internet. On Thursday, he is expected to release draft orders to his fellow commissioners from the United States’ top telecommunications regulatory agency, ahead of a landmark vote on 27 February. “Using this authority, I am submitting to my colleagues the strongest open internet protections ever proposed by the FCC,” Wheeler wrote. “These enforceable, bright-line rules will ban paid prioritization, and the blocking and throttling of lawful content and services. I propose to fully apply – for the first time ever – those bright-line rules to mobile broadband. “My proposal assures the rights of internet users to go where they want, when they want, and the rights of innovators to introduce new products without asking anyone’s permission.”   Related: Net neutrality battle pitches activists and FCC against Big Cable and GOP    Wheeler’s proposals come as Republican critics work on their own legislation, which could effectively stymie his efforts. Senator John Thune is proposing legislation that would ban fast lanes and throttling but would not increase the FCC’s regulatory authority over the cable industry. Last month Thune, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, called Title II a “desperate path” that would upset the “light touch” regulation he said had allowed innovation to flourish online. Objections to the proposals were swift. Michael Powell, CEO of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, cable’s biggest lobby group, said Wheeler’s went “far beyond the worthy goal of establishing important net neutrality protections”. “The cable industry has repeatedly voiced our support for sensible net neutrality rules which accomplish the important protections that president Obama and others have supported – no blocking, no throttling, no paid prioritization and transparency of business practices – and can be enacted without the significant regulatory baggage that comes with public utility regulation,” he said. Doug Brake, a telecommunications policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, an industry lobby group, said the shift to Title II was an “unjustified, overblown response to what has in actuality been a by-and-large hypothetical concern”. But activists – who have bombarded the FCC with demands for stronger regulation – continue to charge that cable companies will stifle innovation by “picking the winners” if they are allowed to charge those who can pay more for faster access. The FCC was effectively left without rules to govern broadband after a court sided with Verizon’s successful challenge to its authority to regulate the industry in January 2014. Officials said they expected fresh legal challenges but were confident they could be overcome. Chris Lewis, vice president of government affairs at advocacy group Public Knowledge, commended Wheeler for his support of Title II authority. “This is a historic announcement by chairman Wheeler, and a decision that consumers have been demanding for some time,” he said. Tiffiniy Cheng, co-founder of Fight for the Future, which has organised a series of protests for net neutrality, said: “We’ll be ramping up the pressure to make sure the details are right, but the significance of the FCC moving to use Title II rules to protect net neutrality is undeniable – it is an awe-inspiring, unprecedented victory for the public and the internet freedom movement against DC’s fiercest lobbies. “Every internet activist who has signed a petition, made a call or showed up at a protest deserves to celebrate. It’s crucial that we keep the pressure on both the FCC and Congress to make sure they get the details right, but no matter what happens from here, we’ve already accomplished more than any pundit, lobbyist or cable CEO thought was possible.”",2015-02-04T16:37:44Z,'Awe-inspiring' FCC internet protections could alter landscape for net neutrality,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""3e6220a6a1388d967428fb043817dfee6176a84d""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/4/1423067948349/14557082400_a03ac2dfb9_o-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Net neutrality protest"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">‘The internet must be fast, fair and open.

"The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is planning tough new rules for regulating the internet that will treat high-speed internet as a public utility, like electricity or water.   Related: Net neutrality battle pitches activists and FCC against Big Cable and GOP    The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that the FCC’s long-awaited proposed new rules for internet regulation will be released to the agency’s five commissioners on Thursday. In November, President Barack Obama called for the “strongest possible” rules to protect net neutrality – the concept that all traffic should be treated equally online. According to the Journal, the FCC has heeded his call.  Among other proposals, the FCC rules will: move to regulate broadband under Title II of the Communications Act, giving it greater powers over internet service providers; change the way both mobile and fixed broadband firms are regulated; and ban broadband providers from prioritising websites in exchange for payment or slowing traffic from other sites. The move, while expected, will meet strong resistance from cable companies and Republicans, who argue that the internet has benefited from light regulation and that greater control will stifle innovation. However, internet activists and top tech companies including Amazon, Google, Netflix, Mozilla and Reddit have called for the FCC to shore up net neutrality, arguing cable firms will create a tiered internet and kill off competition if they are allowed to prioritise some companies over others in return for payments.

"For more than three decades Kevin Zeese has been a burly, vociferous presence on the front lines of protest movements. The 59-year-old Baltimore native has organised protests against the Iraq war, run for the Senate on the Green Party ticket, and campaigned for drug law reform since the 1970s. Now he’s fighting to save the idea of an open internet. Never has he seen the arguments over such a hot-topic issue shift so quickly in his direction. Last May, Zeese was thrown out of an Federal Communications Commission (FCC) meeting, as the regulator looked set to pass new rules that among other things would have allowed cable companies to create and charge extra for “fast lanes” and end net neutrality – the principle that all traffic should be treated equally online.   Related: The 'big dogs' will sue over net neutrality regardless, says FCC head    This week, FCC commissioners will start discussing a new set of rules for regulating the web that could ban fast lanes. That ban would be part of a set of rules that, if passed, will regulate the internet in the similar way to utilities like water or electricity – a move net activists have been dreaming of for decades, believing it will allow the regulator to better protect net neutrality. The change in tone has been swift and dramatic and it even caught Zeese by surprise. Cable companies have long challenged the FCC’s authority to regulate them. The latest attempt to rewrite the FCC’s rules came last January, after Verizon successfully challenged its authority to regulate the broadband industry. Rich, powerful and well connected, cable companies are used to getting what they want. A couple of years ago at a fundraiser at the home of David Cohen, Comcast’s chief lobbyist, President Barack Obama quipped: “I’ve been here so much, the only thing I haven’t done in this house is have seder dinner.” Even the FCC – or perhaps that should be especially the FCC – appears to be in cable’s pocket. Chairman Tom Wheeler used to be president of the National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association (NCTA), Big Cable’s lobbying group. The current chairman of the NCTA is Michael Powell … formerly head of the FCC. Against such powerful opponents Zeese, co-director of pressure group Popular Resistance, looked underpowered. He used old-school methods to make his point, camping outside the Washington office of the FCC, badgering Wheeler at his home, blocking his drive and forcing him to take the subway to work, organising protests outside the White House. But while the physical protests were mainly small affairs, behind him was an army of online activists so massive that after comedian John Oliver called on protesters to email the FCC in support of net neutrality, they crashed the regulator’s servers.   Related: John Oliver's cheeky net neutrality plea crashes FCC website    Spurred on by online activists including Fight for the Future, a six-person team that has managed to coordinate protests with people and companies including Reddit, Netflix, Mozilla and PornHub, people have now submitted more than four million comments on the FCC proposals. A topic many had dismissed as boring and wonky has proved more controversial than Janet Jackson’s nipple – the singer’s accidental exposure during the Super Bowl in 2004 triggered a then record 1.4m comments to the FCC. “Often these campaigns are generational. Look at gay marriage or marijuana. This was different, it’s been so fast,” said Zeese. “Having an open internet has made a huge difference. That’s why we fought so hard. Verizon’s victory was a dark day for open-internet activists. Big Cable appeared to be on the brink of ending net neutrality. The court victory meant the FCC no longer had the authority to stop internet service providers (ISPs) blocking or “unreasonably” discriminating against services. After the decision, Netflix emerged as the poster child of blocking. The company had its service slowed by ISPs as they negotiated fees – a move Oliver described as having “all the ingredients of a Mob shakedown”. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Netflix founder Reed Hastings has become the tech industry’s loudest proponent of net neutrality. That spinning wheel many customers have dreaded while waiting for House of Cards or other Netflix shows to load has become a powerful avatar of what activists say is at stake in the debate. The rules now likely to be brought before the FCC would give the regulator the power to oversee broadband under Title II of the communications act of 1996, giving it far greater authority over the industry and the power to ban “throttling” – deliberately slowing internet traffic. There is still a long way to go. The five FCC commissioners will vote of the proposal on 26 February and ahead of the meeting, lobbying for changes will be intense. In the meantime, in Congress, Republicans are working on a bill that would undermine the FCC’s plans.  But even there the debate has shifted. Last year Fred Upton, Republican chairman of the House committee on energy and commerce, called net neutrality “a solution in search of a problem”. The more cantankerous Senator Ted Cruz called it “Obamacare for the internet”. Now the Republicans too support net neutrality. The bill under discussion would also ban blocking or “throttling” of web traffic and prohibit the creation of paid “fast lanes” – even if it would also defang the FCC. “How is it that such a powerful corporate lobby, one that invests tens of millions of dollars in lobbying, is losing this debate so quickly?” asks Tim Karr, senior director of strategy for Free Press, a New Jersey-based public advocacy group. “I think the answer is that it has taken a decade.” ‘The strongest possible rules’     Barack Obama supports net neutrality. Photograph: Carolyn Kaster/AP    Internet activists have coalesced around net neutrality after a series of skirmishes. Activists began worrying about net neutrality in 2005, when the US supreme court ruled against a move to force cable companies to share their infrastructure with ISPs such as Brand X and EarthLink. The FCC, then overseen by Powell, joined with the cable companies in opposing the challenge. An alphabet soup of acts then came before Congress, from the Communications Opportunity, Promotion and Enhancement (Cope) Act of 2006 to the Stop Online Piracy Act (Sopa) of 2014. An unlikely band of activists came together to protest what they saw as attempts to push through legislation which would restrict their freedom of expression online. The Christian Coalition of America and Gun Owners of America opposed Cope, for example, alongside the liberal nonprofit Common Cause. By the time the latest spat came before the FCC, Karr argues, net activists had sharpened their tactics and raised their game.  “They had been successful at killing bills but not very successful at creating new rules,” he said.  With net neutrality, that appears to have changed. Activists haven’t just lobbied to kill a bill – they have specifically pushed for Title II. It has worked. In November Obama, who has always been a champion of net neutrality but had never thrown his weight behind specific legislation to protect it, also came out for Title II, calling on the FCC to enact the “strongest possible rules” to protect an open internet.   Related: Obama calls on FCC to make 'strongest possible rules' to protect net neutrality    The president’s speech caused outrage in the cable community. The National Cable and Telecommunications Association (NCTA), which represents cable companies including Comcast and Time Warner, said it was stunned by the president’s proposals. The industry remains deeply unhappy at the way the debate has shifted. Speaking off the record, one broadband executive said the industry had widely been supportive of net neutrality and the debate had been mischaracterised.  “We have been on the record for years supporting no blocking, no throttling. The net activists have made this a debate about Title II,” he said. Everything changed after the Obama’s midterm election defeat, he said. “Obama wanted to reset his liberal credentials,” the executive said. “It became clear to everyone as soon as Obama weighed in that Wheeler had no choice.” But Title II will not get activists what they want, the executive said. If and when the FCC brings in its new powers, they will inevitably end in court. ‘This is about big-picture stuff’     Senator John Thune, seen here behind majority leader Mitch McConnell, is working on legislation to trump FCC moves on net neutrality. Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty Images    Professor Christopher Yoo of University of Pennsylvania Law School, a well known net neutrality skeptic, said politics had played a large part in the cable companies inability to take on their opponents. Obama had chosen to enter the fray “less to promote a serious discussion and more to send a political signal,” he said. But he argued that other factors are at play – not least the controversial proposed merger of cable’s two largest players, Comcast and Time Warner, which is now under review by the FCC. Taking on the FCC during that review might not work in their favor. “Their primary goal is get that merger done,” Yoo said. “One of the most seditious aspects of the FCC merger review is its chilling action on the participants in the [net neutrality] debate. “People in the industry are generally quite weary of the net neutrality debate. It’s been going on for a decade. A substantial part of the industry would like to get this resolved and move on.” But Title II is unlikely to do that, he argues. The telecommunications act was last overhauled almost 20 years ago. The FCC has suggested it will “forebear” parts of the act, in order to allow ISPs greater freedom, but tighter regulation will inevitably hamper innovation, he argues.  “Everyone loves the internet for its permissionless innovation. The government is slow – for good reasons. By its very nature government does not work on internet time,” he said. Yoo said he hopes Congress will step in and legislate before this “mess” is passed. Congress may well step in. Republican senator John Thune is currently working on legislation that would trump the FCC’s moves. Obama would no doubt block it but he will not be in office forever. When and if the GOP’s net neutrality rules come to the floor, the net activists will be ready. From her home office in Boston, Evan Greer, campaign director for Fight for the Future, said she was under no illusion that the war was won and that she expected some backlash from the successes they had scored in this battle. “I wouldn’t be surprised if there was a move to try and limit the tactics we’ve used to organise online,” she said. “Whenever a tactic of protest becomes effective, there are often attempts to limit it.” But she is confident the internet will be behind her when the next skirmish starts. “This is about big-picture stuff,” she said. “It’s about freedom of expression, freedom of ideas. People will fight for that.”",2015-02-02T12:00:07Z,Net neutrality battle pitches activists and FCC against Big Cable and GOP,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-cb1fa661-fb7c-4934-8a02-a6465f3664fc""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/1/1422829350642/783eda87-440b-4a96-b393-249b7c023866-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">FCC chairman Tom Wheeler used to head the lobbying group which represents the big cable firms. </span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Alex Wong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",20,President Obama supports new rules that if passed will regulate the internet like water and electricity – executives and Republican politicians do not,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/1/1422829350981/915e1dc0-33ed-43d6-8dc8-beb3e20b9913-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/02/net-neutrality-activists-fcc-big-cable-republicans,5,negative
"BlackBerry’s chief executive has called for net neutrality regulations to force application developers to make their apps available for his company’s platform. John Chen, who became BlackBerry’s head in November 2013, made the request in a letter and blogpost sent to the chairmen and members of several US government committees on commerce. Chen noted that net neutrality is a widely contested term, and that most discussion “has focused on telecommunications carriers and how they operate and manage their physical networks”.  Instead, he argued, “policymakers should demand openness not just at the traffic/transport layer, but also at the content/applications layer of the ecosystem. Banning carriers from discriminating but allowing content and applications providers to continue doing so will solve nothing.” “Unfortunately,” he continues, “not all content and applications providers have embraced openness and neutrality… Netflix, which has forcefully advocated for carrier neutrality, has discriminated against BlackBerry customers by refusing to make its streaming movie service available to them. Many other applications providers similarly offer service only to iPhone and Android users. “This dynamic has created a two-tiered wireless broadband ecosystem, in which iPhone and Android users are able to access far more content and applications than customers using devices running other operating systems. These are precisely the sort of discriminatory practices that neutrality advocates have criticised at the carrier level.” Chen’s comments have not been well received. “Chen’s freestyling redefinition of neutrality equates two highly distinct industries and conflates a whole bunch of issues into a specious, and utterly warped, argument,” argues the Verge’s Vlad Savov. “As he rightly puts it, internet service providers are ‘like the railways of the last century, building the tracks to carry traffic to all points throughout the country’ and apps are ‘the railway cars travelling on those tracks.’ But asking for neutral tracks simply means non-intervention on the part of the carriers, whereas trying to achieve neutral railway cars would require app developers to code their apps multiple times over to cover every mobile OS out there.” But web developer Terence Eden argues that Chen is “right, but for the wrong reasons”. “The web works everywhere,” he says. “Even the worst BlackBerry from years ago can display HTML, CSS, and run JavaScript. The more recent browsers do it just as well as iOS, Android, and Windows. “We’re fast entering a situation where just about any app can be run as a website. Yet we see large services like WhatsApp balkanising the ecosystem by only blessing certain phones and browsers. “I believe in network neutrality - and think that governments should mandate it. I don’t think they should mandate open standards for private companies - but I would hope that the economics of a diverse portfolio of devices would encourage companies to develop open standards to let their products flourish.”  Net neutrality: what is it and why does it matter?

"President Obama pledged his support for a “free and open internet” in his State of the Union speech Tuesday as Republicans prepared to debate net neutrality rules before a key vote by regulators. The House and Senate commerce committees will debate regulation of the internet on Wednesday, a day after Obama reiterated his support for an open internet. “I intend to protect a free and open internet, extend its reach to every classroom, and every community, and help folks build the fastest networks, so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world,” Obama said Tuesday night. His comments follow a more forceful speech in November in which he called for the “the strongest possible rules to protect” net neutrality – the principle that all traffic on the internet should be treated equally. Next month, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) will vote on whether to reclassify broadband as a public utility under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, a move that would prevent internet service providers from creating separate speed tiers for services like Netflix, which has been fought by cable companies and many Republicans.  The FCC was previously forced to rewrite its rules on the internet after a series of court defeats at the hands of cable companies left it without effective powers to regulate broadband. The commission has been inundated by public comments in support of net neutrality since it began its public comment period last year. And in recent months some Republicans have come out in support of tighter regulation of the internet.  Senator John Thune, the chairman of the Senate commerce committee, will chair a hearing on net neutrality Wednesday. Thune is against reclassifying broadband services under Title II, but has put forward proposals that would bar internet service providers from creating special “fast lanes” for sites that pay more or selectively slowing traffic. Speaking on condition of anonymity, some tech executives speculated that Obama’s more muted comments on net neutrality Tuesday night were intended to prevent controversy over what has until now been a partisan debate. Net neutrality activists were cheered by Obama’s continued support for tighter regulation. “The president has spoken on net neutrality, and once again called unequivocally for Title II reclassification, but what’s more important is that the public has spoken,” said Evan Greer, co-founder of lobby group Fight For the Future, which has championed net neutrality regulation.  “Now real net neutrality rules that were once considered impossible seem almost inevitable. The internet has changed the rules of what is possible for our democracy. What the president says is important, but in the end, perhaps not as important as what the internet says. And the internet says it wants real net neutrality, now.” Scott Belcher, the chief executive of the Telecommunications Industry Association, said tighter regulation was unnecessary. “TIA applauds the president’s efforts to advance broadband, improve cybersecurity and open Cuba’s telecommunications market. At the same time, we continue to strongly oppose the president’s call to reclassify the internet as a public utility,” he said. “By maintaining the light touch regulatory approach that has given us a robust internet, we will continue to foster investment and growth.”",2015-01-21T13:00:05Z,Obama pledges support for net neutrality to 'keep reshaping our world',"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""2e72ccbe00d7df2d7a812082aeffd26155aa06fd""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/2e72ccbe00d7df2d7a812082aeffd26155aa06fd/0_0_4500_2699/1000.jpg"" alt=""Barack Obama: ‘I want to help folks build the fastest networks.’"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Barack Obama: ‘I want to help folks build the fastest networks.’</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",22,President says ‘I intend to protect a free and open internet’ as Congress prepares to debate net neutrality before a key vote by regulators,http://media.guim.co.uk/2e72ccbe00d7df2d7a812082aeffd26155aa06fd/0_0_4500_2699/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/21/obama-net-neutrality-state-of-the-union,5,neutral
"2015 looks set to be another year of important developments in media law. This piece highlights some of the key areas for media professionals to monitor. One obvious subject that isn’t included here is data protection. It’s so vast and important that The Guardian is devoting an entire article to it later this month. Copyright and piracy With a view to making our copyright system better suited to the digital age, in November, media lawyers saw the arrival of the long-awaited final stages of the Hargreaves recommendations. They include a series of new statutory copyright exceptions [PDF] around quotation and data mining. 2015 will see whether the changes are for the better. The law has also been changed to allow people to make more use of creative content protected by copyright, for the purpose of caricature, parody or pastiche, without having to obtain the permission of the rights holder. Expect to see an increase in sampling and artworks, especially by musicians and cartoonists, with a consequential increase in court actions testing the boundaries of the new exceptions. On the other side of the fence, 2015 will continue to see online piracy causing problems and the industry trying a mixture of hard and soft measures to control it. In July this year, a new industry scheme, Creative Content UK, was launched aimed at promoting legal entertainment online and establishing a system of education and warnings for internet users whose connections are being used to illegally share films and music. In November, the high court ordered six of the UK’s leading internet service providers to block a total of 53 web sites, which brings to 93 the total of blocked sites providing access to such content since the first restrictions began in 2012. November also saw a new EU commission take charge, with harmonising copyright reform high up on their agenda. Expect to see continued attempts to break down the national silos of telecoms regulation, copyright and data protection legislation, with a view to their greater harmonisation and the completion of an EU digital single market. Some are predicting one-stop shopping to ease consumer access to content from other EU-member states and copyright levies relating to use on the web. Net neutrality The battle over how best to protect and promote an open internet will continue. Deciding whether to entrust the internet to government control or the control of the telecommunications companies or internet service providers (ISPs) will continue to be a difficult call. Net neutrality or open internet rules work on the basis that all traffic on the internet should be treated equally and that consumers should be able to use the internet more or less how they please. In the US (but see this as reflecting the battleground more widely), there is an ongoing battle over how the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) should classify broadband internet service providers. The FCC is considering reclassifying ISPs as “telecommunications services” as opposed to their current designation of “information services” which would give the FCC far more power to regulate ISPs.     The fight for net neutrality will continue in 2015.    Edward Snowden and privacy Talking of the internet, a global study of more than 20,000 internet users released in November by the Centre for International Governance Innovation and Ipsos revealed that 60% of internet users have heard about Edward Snowden and of those aware, 39% have taken steps to protect their online privacy and security as a result of his revelations about the Prism/Tempora programme. The obtaining, use and retention of personal data by state agencies and commercial companies has come under intense scrutiny since then. 2015 will see increased awareness of online privacy among consumers. In the UK, this will manifest itself in more people using subject access requests under the Data Protection Act. There will also be further legal challenges to the way the police have been using the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act to monitor the activities of journalists. Following on from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruling against Google Spain, there will undoubtedly be more take down requests, not only impacting Google but also other tech comapnies such as Microsoft, Facebook and Yahoo. The increasing influence of the European Commission and the CJEU The Google Spain right to be forgotten case was one of the major events of 2014 and the ramifications will continue to reverberate in 2015. The CJEU will continue to flex its muscles in areas around freedom of expression that are traditionally considered to be the remit of the European court of human rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. While media lawyers are all familiar with the role and rulings of the ECHR on issues of freedom of expression, we have been less cognisant of the potential of the CJEU. In 1995, there was a surprise court ruling on where a company could be sued for damages in the libel case Shevill versus Presse Alliance SA. Then in April 2014, there was the Digital Rights Ireland ruling that the Data Retention Directive was invalid followed not long after, in May, by the CJEU’s ruling against Google Spain. In June, a court in Ireland referred the issue of US “safe harbours” to the CJEU. Conjoined with these CJEU forays, the European parliament’s attack on what it regards as the anti-competitive nature of the big US internet giants will intensify in 2015.     A Google search removal request displayed on the screen of a smart phone. Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA    Regulation Although not law, the ongoing battle over media regulation is set to continue, especially with a general election due in May 2015. In November 2012, the Leveson report made recommendations for the independent self-regulation of the press. In March 2013, the leaders of the three main political parties signed up to a new independent regulatory system, establishing a Leveson compliant process of independent verification (or “recognition”) for any new regulatory arrangements that resulted. On 30 October 2013, a royal charter [PDF] was granted which established the Recognition Panel to provide that independent verification. In response, the print media set up the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), which started operation in September 2014. Ipso so far has published only one resolution. Rival regulator, the Impress Project is waiting in the wings. The Guardian, the Independent and the Financial Times have not signed up to Ipso. 2015 is undoubtedly going to see the battle lines converging, amid calls for Leveson part two into the extent of unlawful or improper conduct within News International and other media organisations, and into the way in which the police investigated those organisations, to take place as soon as the current criminal trials end. Programmatic advertising Programmatic advertising – display ads that are bought and sold using automated systems and processes such as real-time bidding – is growing at a huge rate. According to a recent study by research and strategy consultancy MTM on behalf of the Internet Advertising Bureau UK (IAB), almost £3 in every £10 spent on online display ads in 2013 were bought through programmatic technologies. The study shows that of the £1.86bn spent on display ads across the internet and mobile in 2013, 28% (about £500m) was traded programmatically. A key issue here next year will be around how this data is used. Expect the lack of regulation around this area to feature as well.

"The composer and aesthete Lord Berners was a famous eccentric who hated sharing railway compartments with strangers and developed a sure-fire way of ensuring that he travelled alone. He would stand at the door of his chosen compartment, maniacally beckoning people in. This being England, no one ever entered. Nowadays, the same effect may be achieved by telling people that you wish to engage them in a discussion about net neutrality. You get the glassy smile, the sideways glance checking the location of the nearest exit, the sudden remembering of things that have to be done at that very moment, and all the other evasive tactics deployed by those who find themselves in the presence of a madman. And yet, net neutrality is important. In the US four million people got so fired up about it that they wrote to Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), because they suspected he was about to renege on the sacred principle. Recently, even President Obama got in on the act, making a speech arguing that the FCC should create “a new set of rules protecting net neutrality and ensuring that neither the cable company nor the phone company will be able to act as a gatekeeper, restricting what you can do or see online”. Neutrality, Obama said, “has been built into the fabric of the internet since its creation – but it is also a principle that we cannot take for granted”. The FCC should “implement the strongest possible rules to protect net neutrality”. To understand this you need to know something of how the internet works. Basically it does so by breaking every communication into small pieces called data packets. Think of them as electronic envelopes: inside each is a small segment of an email, a photograph, a music track, a telephone conversation, whatever. So an email might be broken into dozens or hundreds of packets. These packets are dispatched across the net towards their destinations, often travelling by different routes and arriving in a different order from that in which they were dispatched. On arrival they are reassembled into their correct order by TCP (transmission control protocol) software. The early internet treated all packets as equals and gave none privileged treatment. The network was, in that sense, truly neutral. For applications such as email and file transfer, that was fine, but once people started coming up with new applications, such as streaming media or voice over internet protocol, strict neutrality came to be seen as sub-optimal. After all, if the successive packets of a video or a voice conversation have to be painstakingly reassembled at their destination, then the quality of the communication starts to degrade: videos and audio recordings stutter; voice communication breaks up. So to deal with this, the original strict neutrality principle had to be pragmatically weakened: all bits might be created equal, but some bitstreams needed special handling. The important thing was that erosions of the neutrality principle happened for engineering rather than commercial reasons. As an organising principle, net neutrality explains why the internet has enabled such an explosion of creativity over the past 30 years. It meant that if you were smart enough to invent something that could be done with data packets, then the internet would do it for you with no questions asked. What that meant was that the barriers to entry for innovators were incredibly low – which is why Tim Berners-Lee was able to launch the web and a Harvard sophomore named Mark Zuckerberg could unleash Facebook on an unsuspecting world. Net neutrality created what the Stanford scholar Barbara van Schewick calls “an architecture for permissionless innovation”. The current hoo-hah in the US was triggered by the decision of some ISPs (such as Comcast) to charge content providers such as Netflix to provide fast lanes to get films to subscribers. This was seen as a threat to net neutrality, because it means that those with the deepest pockets get priority for their bitstreams. This seems to me to be a bad idea – ultimately raising the barriers to entry, privileging corporations over other users and reducing the disruptive potential of the network. On the other hand, net neutrality needs to be treated more as a pragmatic aspiration than as holy writ. It needs to be reinterpreted from time to time to stay relevant to changing technological conditions – which is why it made sense once to accept that packets carrying streaming media or voice calls should be handled differently from those carrying email or web pages. If the FCC is looking for a principle, it is that technological changes should be made for engineering, not commercial, reasons. Will the agency’s chairman, who used to be a telecoms lobbyist, see it that way? Is the Pope a Protestant?",2014-11-30T00:05:03Z,We need to be pragmatic about the principle of net neutrality,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""dbabdfe812e8579350588bc59d7e095bf640ee06""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/27/1417111054066/House-of-Cards-011.jpg"" alt=""House of Cards"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Netflix, home of shows such as House of Cards, is facing proposed charges for internet ‘fast lanes’.

"The European commission’s vice president for the digital single market has expressed his concern over Italian proposals to give network providers the ability to offer different speeds to different sites. Andrus Ansip, the former Estonian prime minister, said he was “really worried” about the new plans in an interview with Reuters. In a leaked document dated 14 November, Italy, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU, suggested removing the definitions of “net neutrality” and “specialised services”; the latter are seen by net neutrality proponents as little more than a euphemistic term for offering an internet fast lane to paying customers. In their place would be “clear principles for traffic management in general, as we’ll as the obligation to maintain sufficient network capacity for the internet access service regardless of other services also delivered over the same access.” In contrast to the proposals, Ansip told Reuters that “all the traffic has to be treated equally… The internet has to stay open for everybody.”  He cited the support of President Obama for the original EU proposals, saying “the president of the United States is using our wording - the wording of the European Parliament in the United States of America”. Torrent sites blocked in UK While the EU focuses on net neutrality, six UK ISPs have been required to block access to yet more torrent sites, “including limetorrents.com, nowtorrents.com, picktorrent.com, seedpeer.me and torlock.com”, according to industry site TorrentFreak.  Britain’s internet censorship system, originally built around preventing access to child abuse images, has been extended to cover sites which promote copyright infringement since the Pirate Bay was blocked in February 2012. BT and Sky have now implemented the latest load of changes, preventing direct access for their subscribers (although the blocks are easily circumvented by users with a VPN), but BT has gone one step further and blocked access to other torrent sites as well. “Over the past several days TorrentFreak has received reports from several users of private torrent sites who get an “error blocked” message instead of their favorite sites. These include the popular IPTorrents.com and TorrentDay.com trackers,” TorrentFreak reports. “However, there is no known court decision that requires BT to block these URLs. In fact, no UK ISP has ever blocked a private torrent site before.”  Barack Obama’s support for net neutrality sets precedent for the rest of the world  • The headline, subheading and caption on this article were amended on 28 November.

"No matter what rules the federal communications commission implements on net neutrality, it can expect to face down lawsuits from the major internet service providers, according to its chairman Tom Wheeler. Speaking to reporters, Wheeler accepted that lawsuits were inevitable, but said that it was worth moving ahead with implementation in a more cautious manner. “Look, the big dogs are going to sue, regardless of what comes out,” he said. “We need to make sure we have sustainable rules. That starts with making sure we have addressed the multiplicity of issues that come along and are likely to be raised.” “I want to move forward on open-internet rules with dispatch,” he added. “I also want to have open internet rules that are sustained. And that’s the process we’re going through.” President Obama’s net-neutrality proposals, laid out in early November, called for the “strongest possible rules” to ensure access to the internet becomes a protected resource. Calling an open internet “essential to the American economy, and increasingly to our very way of life”, he asked the FCC to regulate it as a “common carrier”, preventing ISPs from giving privileged connections to paying customers. The major cable companies, speaking through their industry body the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, said they were “stunned” by Obama’s proposals, which were “extreme” in comparison to the “longstanding, bipartisan policy of lightly regulating the internet”. AT&amp;T explicitly threatened a lawsuit the same day, saying that “if the FCC puts such rules in place, we would expect to participate in a legal challenge to such action.” Until Obama’s intervention, the FCC had been planning to hold a vote in December on whether to impose mild regulation supporting net neutrality. The proposals, which were intended to be a compromise between the interests of the ISPs and web firms, have now been put on hold, and the vote delayed to 2015.

"Barack Obama delivered on his promise to make a stand for a free and open internet: by declaring his support for network neutrality this week, he has finally put the weight of his administration behind a position he had originally – and strongly – campaigned for. Now, after six years of posturing, will he get something done?  Network neutrality is a regulatory commitment to preserving the architectural principles upon which the internet was founded, guaranteeing that no content or application could be discriminated against by a network owner. It was guaranteed because the technology of the internet didn’t have the capacity to do anything else – the ability to discriminate was not in its code. But over the last decade, technologists have developed new code that makes it increasingly simple for network owners to pick and choose the content and applications they want to favor, or to block or slow the content and applications they oppose. And armed with these new anti-neutrality tools, it could be Comcast or AT&amp;T that decides what the future of the internet will be, not the innovators and users who have built it so far. Without the rules of network neutrality, they would use the power their own code provides, as any corporation would, to maximize their profits, regardless of the effect on internet innovation. The puzzle in the president’s move, however, has little to do with the substance. Network neutrality is the right policy. It cuts across the left and right among internet activists. But does the president’s willingness to take up this issue now signal a newly liberated, post-political Obama? Or is this the beginning of a fight for executive authority against a clunky and captured “independent” agency – the Federal Communications Commission? The president preempted his hand-picked chairman of the FCC by announcing his own strong policy position before the FCC made a final determination about network neutrality, and after FCC chair Tom Wheeler had hinted that he and his fellow regulators intended to enact a very different policy. By acting first, Obama is pushing Wheeler to either conform to the president’s view, or to stand strong against the man who appointed him.  If Wheeler gets in line, then we’ll just have one more example of the success of the small politics of Washington in a time of stalemate: the full force of the White House succeeds in persuading an independent commissioner to do as the president wills.  But if Wheeler refuses, then it might be a chance for the executive to exercise a kind of presidential authority that only constitutionalists on the furthest of the far right believe the president has. Believers in a strong unitary executive branch think the president has the power to remove even independent commissioners – at least when they act in a way that is fundamentally contrary to the will of the executive (and, in this case, contrary to the submitted comments of nearly 4m Americans). Dismissing Tom Wheeler would give the president and the supreme court a chance to revisit a question first raised against President Franklin Roosevelt, and decided against him – only this time, the president’s strongest ally on the court would be none other than Justice Antonin Scalia. But if this move isn’t meant to set up one kind of executive-power showdown or another, and if it instead signals the beginning of a post-political Obama, then that is good news indeed. There was no political return – in the world of money-driven electoral politics – for taking on the network companies before last week’s midterms elections. Cable companies and cellphone networks are very eager to avoid exactly the kind of regulations which network neutrality would impose. Had Obama signaled his strong support for that regulation in advance of the election, no doubt many more millions of dollars would have entered the race to support opponents of the president’s agenda.  Barack Obama now has zero political constraints: he doesn’t have to stand for reelection, his party has not treated him well, and he’s free – in his last two years – to act in a way that defines the legacy of his administration, even if he cannot control the policies that Congress will enact. The man who was delivered to the presidency by the power of a free and open internet, grassroots donations-style, rightly should defend that very platform against imminent threats. Let’s hope this is just the first in a series of initiatives Obama will launch in 2015 and 2016 that he should have taken up six years ago. Here’s another: Obama was the first president since Richard Nixon elected without public funding for his campaign. When he turned down public funding, he promised to propose a new presidential public funding system. He should make good on that promise too.  And if he does, why stop there? If the last six years have taught us anything, it is how little even a great president can do when faced with a Gulliver Congress strapped by the Lilliputian ties of special interest money. Let these last two years of his administration be a firm and full commitment to rallying America to what the vast majority of Americans already believe: that we must find an end to the system of corruption that lets nothing in Washington work. Not just to save the internet, but also to make it possible for this Congress to address every other important issue that this nation faces.

"America’s major telecoms and cable companies and business groups came out fighting on Monday after Barack Obama called for tough new regulations for broadband that would protect net neutrality, saying they were “stunned” by the president’s proposals.  The president called for new regulations to protect “net neutrality” – the principle that all traffic on the internet should be treated equally. His move came as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) finalises a new set of proposals for regulation after the old rules were overturned by a series of court defeats at the hands of cable and telecom companies. In response, Republican senator Ted Cruz went so far as to call Obama’s proposal for regulating the web “Obamacare for the internet”, saying on Twitter “the internet should not operate at the speed of government.”  The powerful National Cable and Telecommunications Association (NCTA), which represents cable companies including Comcast and Time Warner said it was “stunned” by the president’s proposals. “The cable industry strongly supports an open internet, is building an open internet, and strongly believes that over-regulating the fastest growing technology in our history will not advance the cause of internet freedom,” said NCTA president Michael Powell, former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which is now rewriting the internet rules. The cable and telcoms giants are particularly concerned by Obama’s call for FCC to reclassify consumer broadband service under Title II of the Telecommunications Act. Such a move would reclassify consumer internet as a “common carrier” service – like the telephone – and give the regulator greater power to control prices and services.  “We are stunned the president would abandon the longstanding, bipartisan policy of lightly regulating the internet and [call] for extreme Title II regulation,” said Powell. Fred Campbell, former head of wireless communications at the FCC and now executive director of free market tech group Center for Boundless Innovation in Technology said applying Title II to the internet would create “legal uncertainty at home and encourage the efforts of totalitarian regimes abroad to tighten their control over the internet – the 21st Century’s mass media communications system.” Obama’s endorsement “of 1930s era Title II classification would lead to unprecedented government interference in the internet, and would hurt consumers and innovation,” said lobby group Broadband for America.  Obama’s statement also set him at loggerheads with David Cohen, the executive vice-president of Comcast, who has been one of the president’s biggest fundraisers.  Cohen said the cable company “fully embraces the open internet principles that the president and the chairman of the FCC have espoused” but argued section 706 of the telecommunications act – the regulatory legislation preferred by the cable and telecoms industry “provides more than ample authority to impose those rules”. The president’s move has set the stage for a political showdown in Washington where the cable industry has been left looking flat-footed by a vocal and well- organised grass roots opposition.     FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler during an open meeting to receive public comment on proposed open Internet notice. Photograph: Alex Wong/Getty Images    The FCC is chaired by Tom Wheeler, a Democrat and former cable lobbyist. There are two Republican members of the five-member board, and both are expected to be staunchly against Obama’s proposals. But their opposition comes after over four million comments were submitted to the FCC about its new internet regulation rules. Analysis has shown the overwhelming majority of submissions called for more regulation, not less. The split is likely to be one of the key battlegrounds after Obama’s midterm election defeats. Mitch McConnell, who will become majority leader in the Senate when the Republicans take control in January, urged the FCC to reject Obama’s comments, saying it amounted to “heavy-handed regulation that will stifle innovation”. The FCC will ultimately decide on its own rules but will face intense political pressure as it finishes drawing them up. Washington sources had expected the proposals to be circulated as soon as this month before a meeting of the FCC in December. A leaked proposal last week suggested a “hybrid” compromise was under discussion which would expand the FCC’s powers to regulate broadband while also allowing a carve out for cable providers to charge more money for fast lanes.  In his response to Obama, Wheeler said the FCC has explored a “hybrid” solution but that it had created as many questions as it had answered. “The more deeply we examined the issues around the various legal options, the more it has become plain that there is more work to do,” said Wheeler.

"Barack Obama called for “the strongest possible rules to protect” the open internet on Monday and came out against proposals championed by cable and telecoms companies to create fast lanes for the web. The president’s statement comes as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) prepares to publish new rules to regulate the internet after a series of legal defeats at the hands of telecoms and cable companies. “An open internet is essential to the American economy, and increasingly to our very way of life. By lowering the cost of launching a new idea, igniting new political movements, and bringing communities closer together, it has been one of the most significant democratizing influences the world has ever known,” Obama said. The president came out firmly against a proposal that would allow cable companies to create “fast lanes” for higher paying customers. Cable and telecoms companies have lobbied for fast lanes, arguing that companies like Netflix should pay more for the large amount of bandwidth they use.  Opponents argue such a move would create a tiered internet with faster service for those who can pay, and end “net neutrality” – the principle that all traffic is equal on the web. “Net neutrality has been built into the fabric of the internet since its creation — but it is also a principle that we cannot take for granted. We cannot allow internet service providers (ISPs) to restrict the best access or to pick winners and losers in the online marketplace for services and ideas,“ wrote Obama. He said the FCC should impose “the strongest possible rules to protect net neutrality.” Net neutrality campaigners cheered the president’s statement. David Segal, executive director of Demand Progress, called it a “huge blow for the cable companies that seek to establish fast and slow lanes on the internet”. The telecoms and cable industry said they were stunned by the news and called Obama’s proposals unworkable. Telecommunications Industry Association CEO Scott Belcher said he was “deeply concerned” by the president’s proposals and they would “set the industry back decades”. Obama’s move looks set to start a heated political debate in Washington, where Republican Senator Ted Cruz said on Twitter: “Net Neutrality” is Obamacare for the Internet; the Internet should not operate at the speed of government.”      Obama with Xi Jinping in Beijing. Photograph: Sasha Mordovets/Getty Images    The president’s move will place extraordinary pressure on the FCC, which is an independent agency but whose senior figures are appointed by the president. Chairman Tom Wheeler is a Democrat, but the FCC’s board is split between Democrat and Republican members and the Republicans have shown clear opposition to imposing more regulation on internet service providers. After receiving more than 4m comments from the general public, the FCC had reportedly been discussing a “hybrid” solution that would have allowed tiered services but imposed stricter rules to protect customers. The proposal met with stiff opposition from net neutrality supporters, who now have the backing of Obama. The president set out four “commonsense” rules he would like to see the FCC impose:  No blocking. If a consumer requests access to a website or service, and the content is legal, an internet service provider (ISP) should not be permitted to block it.  No “throttling”. ISPs should not be allowed to intentionally slow down some content or speed up others – a process often called “throttling”. Increased transparency. Internet service is not just about the so-called “last mile” – the connection to a customer’s home, said Obama. The FCC should monitor for potential abuses across the network.  No paid prioritization. Obama came out firmly against “fast” and “slow” lanes arguing against cable firm’s charging higher fees for faster service. He called for an “explicit ban on paid prioritization and any other restriction that has a similar effect.”  Obama said: “The FCC is an independent agency, and ultimately this decision is theirs alone. I believe the FCC should create a new set of rules protecting net neutrality and ensuring that neither the cable company nor the phone company will be able to act as a gatekeeper, restricting what you can do or see online.” Wheeler called the president’s comments an “important and welcome addition to the record” and promised to take them into account in the commission’s deliberations. “From the beginning, I have pledged to finally bring to an end the years-long quest for rules that are upheld in court,” he said. Supporters of net neutrality supporters welcomed president’s comments. Holmes Wilson, co-director of the Fight for the Future advocacy group, said: “Thanks to the second largest online protest in history, nearly 4m comments, White House and FCC phone lines ringing off the hook, and even nationwide street protests, President Obama finally gets it, and can say so.” He said the FCC should reclassify internet service, under Title II of the Communications Act, to give it “common-carrier” status, which would give the FCC far wider powers of regulation.  “At this point it should be unthinkable that Tom Wheeler would defy the American public and the president, but we hope President Obama is prepared to demote him if he doesn’t move forward in good faith with Title II reclassification,” he said. Cable companies and others have been fighting hard to stop the FCC imposing Title II status on internet services, arguing it will stifle innovation and introduce unnecessary red tape.

"There is no surer way to get geeks on the web riled up than the most powerful man on earth declaring that “there is no higher calling than protecting an open, accessible, and free Internet”. But Barack Obama’s sweeping statement in support of net neutrality on Monday morning did just that, pitting him against major telecoms, Republicans and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) commissioners who will soon decide on new rules that could reclassify net neutrality as protected … or not so much. Vox has an explainer for the relatively uninformed (John Oliver’s version has significantly more laughs), but the short version of Obama’s plan is as follows:  No blocking = telecoms can’t pick and choose which sites you can and can’t see – they can’t manipulate internet traffic No throttling = internet service providers (ISPs) can’t slow down some content while giving preference to, say, Netflix streams Increased transparency = as long as the content you want to see is legal, your ISP can’t stop you from seeing it – a plan the FCC is starting to get behind No paid prioritization = no so-called “fast lane” deals, which the telecoms love  FCC commissioner Tom Wheeler (a former cable and wireless industry lobbyist) hasn’t said much in his response, but the hybrid plan his office floated in the Wall Street Journal last week didn’t make anyone happy on either side. So: what now? Will Obama’s plan turn into action – and a more open internet? Or did he just get the geeks’ hopes up for nothing? “The president has gone all in,” Tim Wu, the Columbia University professor who coined the term “net neutrality”, told the Verge. “Sometimes, it takes someone who’s not deeply embedded in the game to say this is the obvious thing to do to.” Because you’re probably not deeply familiar with the ins and outs of American telecom regulations, here’s how the social web is reacting so far.

Why Comcast cares about net neutrality, in one chart pic.twitter.com/X0ZdS3CDHy&mdash; Ryan Grim (@ryangrim) November 10, 2014    In response to the president, Big Internet came out swinging. Verizon’s statement went as far as to threaten another lawsuit should internet service be reclassified as a public utility:  That course will likely also face strong legal challenges and would likely not stand up in court.  Comcast’s message to Obama offered slightly less fire and brimstone, as America’s largest telecom took an almost Romney-esque “you didn’t build that” tone:  The internet has not just appeared by accident or gift – it has been built by companies like ours investing and building networks and infrastructure.  The cable and telephone behemoths were also quick to paint the administration’s wireless broadband proposals as reactionary “antiquated”, evoking comparisons to 1930s-era utility regulations. Meanwhile, the National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Associations – the lobbyists probably behind Astroturfed anti-Net Neutrality marketing in the Silicon Valley – was stunned, just aboslutely stunned, by the news. The bottom line: hints, rocks, hard places – and a fight that won’t be settled overnight Dash Bennett at the Atlantic was quick to point out the harsh reality: “there are no guarantees that any of these rules will even come to pass.” Indeed, as the Guardian’s James Ball tells us: “Obama won’t massively be able to influence what the FCC can or can’t do under current law.” But Silicon Valley consultant Marvin Ammori suggested to USA Today that Obama’s bold statement “gives the political cover for the FCC to actually do the right thing.” Wheeler and the Democratic commissioners on the FCC (who outnumber Republicans) have a big choice, as one tech exec told the Chicago Sun-Times rather bluntly: “Will they stand with Comcast, AT&amp;T and Verizon or the president and the American people?” (The Democratic members of the panel have hinted they’re behind something resembling Obama’s plan.) Niley Patel over at the Verge also kept the announcement in perspective – that Obama has put the FCC “between a rock and a hard place”:  Obama just picked a major fight with the ascendent Republican Party fresh off its huge midterm victories, and they’re not going to let this thing just happen overnight. Expect to see this stretch well into 2015 and get muddled into the FCC / DOJ approval process for the Comcast / Time Warner Cable merger.  Here’s Quartz, even more bluntly than that: “Republicans, who now control Congress, have sided with internet companies that believe weaker regulation will allow for the most innovation and investment.” But as the president himself said in his shock announcement heard ’round the geeky web, “The FCC is an independent agency, and ultimately this decision is theirs alone.” Reddit user pythor translates: “When the guy I hired, who I could fire at any time, decides to completely ignore everything I say in this speech, don’t blame me.”",2014-11-10T18:41:01Z,"Net-neutrality nerds, angry telecoms and Ted Cruz: Obama 'picked a fight' – but will he win?","<figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKcjQPVwfDk""                                                                        > <iframe width=""460"" height=""259"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/uKcjQPVwfDk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>‘We cannot allow internet service providers to restrict the best access or to pick winners and losers,’ Obama said</figcaption> </figure>",30,"<strong>The primer:</strong> We read all the ‘open web’ tweets, ‘fast lane’ posts and ‘Obamacare for the internet’ reactions from insiders and outsiders – from China to reddit and back again – so you don’t have to",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/10/1415644293090/d372dba5-c3c6-459b-b7b5-387bc9ed8da0-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/10/net-neutrality-obama-reactions,9,neutral
"Protesters will gather outside the White House and in a dozen US cities on Thursday to demonstrate against a “hybrid” solution now being considered to end a stalemate over regulating the internet. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is currently redrawing its rules for regulating the internet after a series of court defeats at the hands of cable and telecoms companies that effectively hamstrung its ability to oversee the industry.  Protests are planned in San Francisco’s Civic Center Plaza, on Las Vegas’s boulevard, Federal Plaza in Chicago and at the headquarters of Comcast, the largest cable company, in Philadelphia. “What President Obama’s FCC chair is reportedly pushing is not a compromise, it’s a sham. Nearly four million internet users submitted comments to the FCC against having fast and slow lanes on the internet, but this proposal explicitly opens the door for them. Worse, it’s based in overly complicated and untested legal theories that are likely to fail in court,” said Evan Greer, campaign director for Fight for the Future which is organising the campaign alongside Popular Resistance, Free Press and Reddit. Cable and telecoms companies are pushing for the ability to be able to create “fast lanes” for high volume customers, like Netflix, that would charge more money for the bandwidth they consume. But opponents fear such a move would effectively kill “net neutrality” – the principle that all traffic online should be treated equally. The FCC has been inundated with comments as it has weighed its options. A record 3.7m were sent to the regulator, at one point crashing the FCC’s systems. The Sunlight Foundation analysed the first 800,000 and found that fewer than 1% were opposed to net neutrality enforcement. The “hybrid” proposal now under consideration has not been finalised but according to media leaks and discussions with interested parties they would expand the FCC’s powers to regulate broadband while also allowing a carve out for cable providers to charge more money for fast lanes.  Net neutrality’s defenders want the internet to be regulated under Title II of the Communications Act – a move that would classify the service as a “common carrier” and give the FCC the power to stop cable companies introducing “unreasonable discrimination” and ensure they work “in the public interest”. Cable companies argue such a move would hamper innovation by tying the industry in red tape. The FCC has also considered using Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 which is less stringent in its language and enforces the regulator’s powers to “promote competition” and “remove barriers” to investment. In January Verizon successfully challenged the FCC’s power to use Section 706 to justify anti-discrimination rules in a ruling that led to the current regulatory malaise. The hybrid solution, which may be presented to the FCC at a meeting on 11 December, is likely to use both pieces of legislation as the regulator struggles to reconcile the powerful telecom and cable industry lobby and its numerous and vociferous opponents. The picture has become more complicated now that the Republicans have taken control of Congress after the midterm elections. Proposals for more regulation will face tougher opposition come January when the Republicans take control. Craig Aaron, president of Free Press, a consumer advocacy group that has called for full Title II reclassification of the internet, said: “This proposal divides up the internet in a way that is highly theoretical and not based in the law.” “We are very skeptical that it would work. It’s troubling in a lot of ways: it’s bad politics, bad policy and bad law,” he said.",2014-11-05T16:47:53Z,Net neutrality advocates to protest against 'hybrid' FCC solution in dozens of cities,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-251d0b2b-528c-407d-985c-8f9dc445bf3e""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/5/1415205881951/e17e727b-f3c8-42da-8604-bd36293fd709-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Netflix HBO Comcast"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Cable and telecoms companies are pushing for the ability to create ‘fast lanes’ for high volume customers, like Netflix.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",31,Protests planned outside White House and in other cities in ongoing battle over creation of internet ‘fast lanes’ by cable and telecoms companies,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/5/1415205882343/33585f2c-0f6b-437f-a1bd-328e7106b3d4-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/05/net-neutrality-protest-hybrid-fcc-solution,5,negative
"The connected car revolution may finally almost be upon us, with Vince Cable announcing that satellite-controlled vehicles could be on Britain’s roads within a few years. But connected cars raise a few questions, not least around the safety of vehicles that rely on a permanent high-quality internet connection. In particular, the connected car opens up the debate of net neutrality, which is the principle that internet service providers should treat all data on the internet equally. The internet has 36m adults in the UK accessing it every day and this couldn’t have happened without net neutrality. For example, small companies’ websites are on a level with larger organisations websites. Without net neutrality, large companies could have the option to pay to make their data packets move faster than smaller companies across the same network. Instead of investing in larger faster networks the ISP could maintain profits by limiting certain data packets and prioritising others for a fee. As the internet progresses, people are becoming more familiar with net neutrality, however they tend to associate it with Netflix and media consumption. Net neutrality is actually much bigger than that; especially as we introduce the internet of cars. Let’s think about this for a second; imagine your car is completely connected to the internet. It can offer different routes based on traffic jams, notify you about speed limits and give you a hand with your parking. While all of this sounds great, it could all be compromised if we ignore net neutrality. Without it we could see the connected car affecting public safety, especially if we look at the need for the internet to access maps and for processing. Basically, without net neutrality, “car company A” could pay “mobile provider B” to prioritise its traffic over “car company B’s”. Taking the possibilities to the extreme end of the spectrum, imagine if we had a two tiered internet, where internet service providers (ISPs) charge for basic access and then charge the content providers extra to ensure delivery of their content. Does this mean that anyone on the basic tier could have issues with their content being delivered? If we follow this thought through and say the connected car did not have the super-fast access, or that the company had not paid for the high tier of service, could we see issues when the car could not communicate its location or receive special instructions? What about an ambulance on its way to the emergency department with a critical patient on board. We are at a stage where it is not unreasonable to assume or to think that the patient’s vital signs are being fed in real time to the hospital. What if this provider did not have the special faster tier? Would the speed of delivery of this critical information be hampered? Although these are extreme cases, if we consider these scenarios, we can see that net neutrality is integral when thinking about the connected car. Just as we have freedom of speech and equality in our day-to-day lives, it’s only natural that, as we enter a more digitally-centric world, the same practices occur. As internet and connectivity continue to play a huge part in our lives, we need to make sure that net neutrality also continues to play a part.

"The internet was founded on the principle of anti-discrimination – that bits are bits, that every node makes its best effort to deliver internet traffic. This principle has allowed small startup companies to compete for eyeballs on the same terms as large incumbents. That freedom to compete online has paid off big-time for consumers, entrepreneurs and America’s economy. In today’s broadband market, however, there is no true competition that allows consumers and innovators to choose between internet access providers. Instead, a very few providers operate as monopolies or duopolies and hold nearly unrestrained pricing power over the wires and cables going to our homes. Not only can they charge non-market prices – they can operate their networks in ways that harm consumers and undermine online innovation, exactly when we need it most. Big Cable, having monopolized the 21st-century communications infrastructure, is now looking to boost its short-term profits by creating pay-to-play fast lanes. Which should come as no surprise, but the consequences are unacceptable. Paid prioritization schemes will make it harder for new companies to get out of the garage. And they will undermine the incentives for broadband access providers to continually upgrade America’s internet infrastructure. Well, Big Cable is underestimating Americans if it thinks it can distract or mislead them with half-truths and legal jargon. The public understands the real-world consequences of pay-to-play discrimination. And the record 3m internet users who just finished submitting comments to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) are not going to rest until they are sure that the FCC will effectively protect the principle of equal access to a best-in-class broadband ecosystem. We are at a real crossroads on net neutrality, and it’s not enough to get angry about telecom monopolies anymore. It’s not enough to play watchdog. It is time for the FCC to use its authority to safeguard our broadband future. That means putting an end to plans by Big Cable and its lobbyists to extract internet tolls from some companies while relegating the rest of us to the slow lane. That means the net neutrality fight still needs you to pipe up. After a public outcry over a proposal to scrap the open internet, Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the FCC, finally recognized this month that policymakers have a responsibility “to do everything in our power to ensure that the United States has the world’s most dynamic and competitive broadband ecosystem with a virtuous cycle of new investment, new innovations, and new services.” I agree. I’m proud to count myself as one of the millions of Americans who have been busy writing, calling and tweeting to insist that the FCC do its job.  The FCC must adopt rules that reflects today’s broadband reality. First, it must classify broadband access providers as common carriers under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act, which is the sound source of legal authority that Congress provided the FCC to write clear rules of the road to preserve and defend the open internet. Any other approach will leave the FCC nipping at the heels of Big Cable as it steamrolls over the public interest and ties the FCC up in another protracted legal battle. Next, the FCC must use its authority to prohibit the sort of paid prioritization schemes that stifle investment in new, game-changing products. Because while I enjoy the occasional House of Cards marathon, it’s not just about Netflix. It’s about the next Netflix – and all the other innovative technology coming down the pike. Finally, the FCC must ensure that it preserves the open internet in a manner that actually keeps it open for innovation. Big Cable is misleading the public by arguing that creating common-sense rules of the road is the same as burdensome overregulation. That’s simply not the case. In fact, Congress has given the FCC discretion to refrain from applying any Title II regulations that are not necessary to protect consumers and the public interest. It only takes a handful of such provisions to address the dangers of paid prioritization. The FCC also needs to send a signal to other governments that the United States will stand up for net neutrality. US companies need a level internet playing field at home, and they need a level internet playing field around the globe. Any regulatory approach that leaves room for discrimination within the US market may be used by foreign governments as cover to discriminate against US internet services. Today’s consumers are savvier and more attuned to internet policy than they were even a few years ago. In 2010, it took over a year for internet companies and Americans to rally with me to successfully block so-called Pipa and Sopa legislation that would have led to flat-out internet censorship. In 2012, they came together to fend off draconian internet security schemes like Cispa. But today, the grassroots of the internet are already mobilized in support of the open internet. Last week alone, Americans flooded Congressional phone lines with more than 1,000 calls a minute and over 2m emails to my colleagues in Washington, letting them know that will not sit quietly until the principle of net neutrality is secure. Congress has given FCC the authority to ensure that the internet remains an open platform for innovation, communication and commerce. Now it’s time for the FCC to do its job and show that it values the future of the internet more than a well-funded lobbying campaign.",2014-09-17T10:45:11Z,"Hey, FCC: do your job and stand up for net neutrality, not Big Cable schemes","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-6b6045d1-0b5f-4fe8-ad0a-6725d1c391bf""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/16/1410904619217/41d14955-7d52-4310-a77e-209b14ab8103-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""net neutrality cartoon"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Big Cable is distracting the public by arguing that common-sense rules of the road are the same as burdensome overregulation.

"Move over, Janet Jackson: America is officially more concerned with the future of the internet than with your nipple. After a day of protest against Federal Communications Commission (FCC) proposals for regulating the internet that was coordinated by some of the world’s largest tech companies, the agency announced on Wednesday it had received a record 1,477,301 public comments about the proposals since July. The previous record of 1.4 million was set in 2004 when an alleged “wardrobe malfunction” during the halftime show at the Super Bowl led to Jackson’s breast (plus nipple shield) being flashed to an audience of 111 million. The record was broken as tech companies including Twitter, Reddit, Google and others called on their users to contact the FCC and Congress and express their disapproval over new rules now being considered that they claim would impact “net neutrality”. Net neutrality is the concept that all traffic on the internet is treated equally and that no internet service provider can offer a higher speed service that could unfairly advantage one content provider over another. The number of submissions is likely to rise even higher before a Monday deadline for public comments on the FCC proposals, which are a result of chairman Tom Wheeler’s being forced to rewrite the rules on net neutrality after a federal court tossed the agency’s previous set. One of the proposals has sparked controversy because it would allow internet service providers like Verizon, AT&amp;T and Comcast to create a so-called “fast lane” for certain traffic – a move critics say would de facto create slow lanes. Comments to the FCC spiked earlier this year when comedian John Oliver, on his HBO show, called on people to bombard the FCC in support of net neutrality. “The only two words in the English language more boring than net neutrality are ‘featuring Sting,’”­ said Oliver. “But here’s the thing. Net neutrality is actually hugely important.” The FCC’s antiquated and under funded systems crashed under the volume of calls and submissions shortly after Oliver’s remarks. The FCC fined CBS a record $500,000 over the Jackson incident, though that fine was eventually overturned on appeal. Several big media conglomerates imposed a blacklist on Jackson’s music and videos in the immediate wake of the scandal.",2014-09-10T21:53:24Z,'Nipplegate' dethroned by net neutrality at top of FCC's comments list,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-9a5ea5c7-eef0-46de-987e-9d38f7c945fc""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/10/1410385395451/cb4d3a16-2ad0-41a7-bf6f-c7bf6c45fb9d-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Janet Jackson wardrobe malfunction"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson at halftime of Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: MPS/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>",34,Janet Jackson ‘wardrobe malfunction’ unseated as FCC receives record number of public comments on internet issue,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/10/1410385395810/cb4d3a16-2ad0-41a7-bf6f-c7bf6c45fb9d-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/10/nipplegate-dethroned-net-neutrality-fcc-public-comments,6,negative
"The “spinning wheel of death”. We all hate it. But you may be seeing it a lot on the internet today. That’s because today is the Internet Slowdown, a web-wide uprising against one of the most blatant cases of potential injustice in the history of the net. Cable companies in the US are lobbying the government to destroy net neutrality, the basic underlying principle that has made the internet so awesome. It’s a classic power-grab; corporate behemoths want to lock down the web and make it more like Cable TV, where they get to choose which content gets seen by the most people (or seen at all). It’s a move that threatens not just the future of the internet economy, but the future of free speech, free press, and democracy. Here’s the good news: the internet has been taking self-defence classes, and we’ve got quite good at staving off grave and imminent threats to online freedom. After months of organising, a broad and unlikely coalition of internet users, activist groups and major websites have banded together to declare today a mass day of action to show the world what the internet might look like if Team Cable gets their way and convinces the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to help them gut net neutrality. Throughout today, thousands of websites, including many you know and love like Etsy, Kickstarter, Netflix, Reddit, Mozilla, Foursquare, Namecheap, Meetup, Upworthy and Vimeo, will display prominent messages (or “widgets”) on their home pages featuring that dreaded spinning “Loading...” symbol that always seems to pop up during the cliffhanger moment in the video you’re streaming. The sites taking part in the slowdown will help to reach millions of people and direct internet users to take action at BattleForTheNet.com, a one stop action site that makes it easy to flood decision makers with comments, emails, and phone calls. So how can you participate? If you’ve got a website, blog or Tumblr, there’s still time to get the code and add the Internet Slowdown animated widgets to your site. If not, show your support for the slowdown by changing your profile picture to one of these spinning “Loading...” icons, and posting on social media. Better yet, make your own gifs, graphics, and action tools and share them with the internet using #InternetSlowdown. Most importantly, talk to your friends and family about what the free and open internet means to you, and encourage them to read up and get active. This is about so much more than how fast or slow websites load. History has shown that if a system can be used to censor and marginalise dissenting and alternative voices, it will be. Net neutrality is the secret ingredient that makes the web a level playing field where everyone has a voice. It says that all websites are created equal, and that you should have reliable access to every single thing the web has to offer, whether you’re clicking links on a mainstream news site, binging on cat videos or reading your favourite political blog. Most importantly, net neutrality is about free speech, and preventing powerful interests from discriminating against, censoring, slowing down and blocking content on the internet. The unstoppable momentum of today’s Internet Slowdown is just a reflection of public outcry that has been simmering since the FCC first announced its proposal to allow for a “tiered” (read: divided) internet. We’ve bombarded them with petitions, camped out in tents on their doorstep, and John Oliver of course crashed their website. It has been widely reported that more than 99% of the comments the FCC has received thus far broadly support net neutrality. If the FCC chooses to move ahead with a proposal that benefits cable executives while undermining public interest, then public comment periods are meaningless, and the FCC exposes itself as an agency that has no legitimacy. Government agencies like the FCC should take heed: hell hath no fury like the internet scorned. Growing numbers of people are distrustful of the US government’s actions from NSA surveillance to police militarisation. Thanks to the internet, governments can’t get away with stuff quite the way they used to. There is rebellion brewing online and off. If cable CEOs and their close buddies at the FCC shut their ears to those rumblings, they may find themselves on the run from an angry internet public that will settle for nothing less than a free, uncensored, and sometimes truly weird, internet. Today is a historic day in the fight for internet freedom. I hope to see you in the digital streets demanding real net neutrality. Evan Greer is campaign manager at Fight for the Future.

"Much of the internet went on a “go-slow” protest on Wednesday, as some of the world’s largest tech companies began a protest over proposals that could create fast web lanes for some companies. Tech firms including Netflix, Etsy, FourSquare, KickStarter, Mozilla, Reddit, PornHub and Vimeo installed a widget on their sites to show how they believe the internet would look if the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) overturns “net neutrality” rules. The FCC has been forced to rewrite its rules on governing the internet after a series of court defeats at the hands of cable and telecom companies. Wednesday’s protests are against one proposal that would allow cable firms to create “fast lanes” for paying customers who use a lot of bandwidth. Critics charge that move would end net neutrality – the concept that the internet is a level playing field and internet service providers can not discriminate against any individual, organisation or company.  Twitter, Tumblr and Google also issued statements in support of net neutrality. September 15 is the deadline for comments to be submitted to FCC chairman Tom Wheeler. Namecheap, the domain name registrar, and Vimeo put up videos in support of the campaign. “The internet was designed to empower people. To get online, you need to use an internet access provider. But once you’re online, you decide what to do and where to go. Anyone, anywhere can share their opinions freely – and any entrepreneur, big or small, can build, launch and innovate without having to get permission first,” Derek Slater, Google’s policy manager, said in an email.“We believe that consumers should continue to enjoy open on-ramps to the internet. That means no internet access provider should block or degrade internet traffic, nor should they sell “fast lanes” that prioritize particular internet services over others. These rules should apply regardless of whether you’re accessing the Internet using a cable connection, a wireless service, or any other technology.” He encouraged people to sign up for their Take Action campaign in support of net neutrality. So far 3 million people have signed up. Senators Ron Wyden and Angus King Tweeted their support. “Right now, the FCC is in the process of crafting new rules. Rules that many Americans, members of Congress, innovators, and myself hope will protect net neutrality once and for all. Earlier this year, I submitted my comments to the FCC, making clear that the only way to effectively protect Net Neutrality – the foundation of the Internet – is to reclassify broadband under Title II of the Telecommunications Act,” Wyden wrote in a blogpost. Reclassifying broadband under Title II of the Telecommunications Act would give the FCC far greater powers over cable companies and would effectively allow high speed internet to be regulated more like water, electricity or other utilities. The National Cable and Telecommunications Association (NCTA), which lobbies on behalf of cable giants Comcast, Time Warner and others, called the protest “a PR stunt”. It is lobbying hard against any reclassification that gives the FCC more power. “Even after setting aside the fact that cable companies are supportive of reasonable net neutrality rules, Battle for the Net’s mission statement and the fundamental premise protest day are absurd. Why would the cable industry, which has spent billions upon billions to expand infrastructure, to improve network efficiency, to connect 93 percent of Americans and to increase speeds 1500 percent over the last decade, be actively working to slow down the Internet? It doesn’t make sense,” NCTA wrote in a blogpost.     Some sites, like Netflix, used a popup widget to explain the slowdown. See more images here. Photograph: screengrab         Photograph: screengrab    Ahead of Monday’s deadline for submissions to the FCC organisers have called on supporters to spend the day calling Congress to lobby the FCC to protect neutrality. Evan Greer, co-founder of Fight for the Future, a pressure group helping to organise the protest day, said in an email: “Net neutrality is tough to explain to people, so we wanted to organize an action that actually shows the world what’s at stake. I think the three most hated words on the internet right now are ‘Please wait, loading ... ’ “Unless internet users unite in defence of net neutrality, we could be seeing those dreaded ‘loading’ wheels a lot more often on some of our favourite websites, while monopolistic companies get to decide which content gets seen by the most people.”            Several other large internet companies are expected to back the day of action. Two of the world’s biggest porn sites, Pornhub and RedTube, promised “in-your-face” support. “We’ll be displaying an official widget from battleforthenet.com. We won’t be shutting down, or streaming your porn slower. There will be a big in-your-face message that users will need to close. We hope to reach around 50m people on Sept 10,” a Pornhub spokeswoman wrote on Reddit. Pornhub and RedTube are owned by Mindgeek, a Luxembourg-based conglomerate that claims to be one of the top five bandwidth consumers in the world, generating 1.7bn visits per month.  The organizers, Fight for the Future and Demand Progress, are directing people to call or email policymakers with their concerns.

"In a not-so-distant future, American internet service providers like Comcast, Time Warner Cable, AT&amp;T and Verizon could – if the Federal Communications Commissions allows – pick and choose what you can see on the internet and how fast you can see it. In fact, Netflix is already paying tolls to Verizon and Comcast to keep them from deliberately slowing down your movie streams, and Tom Wheeler, the former cable and wireless industry lobbyist turned FCC chair, has said he thinks that’s only right and proper. You can count on much more ISP interference with your choices and mine unless we have net neutrality. And to reinforce that point, several large websites and a host of smaller ones are attempting to “cover the web” on Wednesday with icons showing a “Loading ...” message as part of a symbolic “Internet Slowdown”. They hope it’ll encourage you to call and email Congress in favor of net neutrality, before the FCC formally decides later this year whether to endorse a “fast-lane, slow-lane” system controlled by the giant telecommunications companies that provide most Americans’ internet access, or classify those providers as public utilities without the power to limit our access. But perhaps it’ll take more than entreaties to Capitol Hill to encourage the FCC to rule in favor of open internet access by reclassifying the ISPs as public utilities. Perhaps what it’ll take is to give them a taste of the slowed-down medicine they want the rest of us to swallow. Kyle Drake, founder of the small hosting company NeoCities, wrote some software code that limited FCC access to NeoCities (though not to the sites they host) from IP addresses associated with the FCC. Then, as the Verge reported, uploaded the code for others to use. Picture Wheeler swearing under his breath as his browser slows to a crawl when he tries to read a story about the FCC on Business Insider. Or, imagine some of the commission engineering staff getting throttled when they visit GitHub, where lots of open-source software gets shared.  Now, one small website’s slow-down probably won’t wreak any havoc at the FCC. But, as a friend who wished to remain anonymous noted, if enough websites got together and used code like Drake’s – especially the online businesses that stand to lose customers in the absence of net neutrality – then everyone who works (or goofs off online at work) at the FCC would have a really annoying day ... or week. Of course, website owners wouldn’t have to stop at IP addresses associated with the FCC. They could implement a one-day slowdown for every Comcast customer in Philadelphia, the company’s home town, just to show them the kind of internet the company wants the government to allow. Or they could do the same in San Antonio and New York, where AT&amp;T and Verizon make their respective headquarters – just to show their customers what could happen if the companies are successful in their efforts to have the FCC declare that a 4-megabit connection qualifies as “broadband”. It’s unlikely that Google or Amazon would take part in any direct way – but it wouldn’t have to prevent its customers’ cloud-hosted sites from joining in and deploying the code to slow the FCC’s building’s access to huge swaths of the internet. Of course, maybe none of this will be necessary: Wheeler may have tipped his hand on the question of internet access as a public utility a few days ago when he noted that “three-quarters of American homes have no competitive choice for the essential infrastructure for 21st century economics and democracy”. If he means to act on that, great: net neutrality is all about choice, and there don’t seem to be a lot of ways to make those statements compatible with a fast lane/slow lane model. But if that isn’t an indication of his intentions, small and large businesses are at risk – even if many don’t yet understand how the telecom giants would, over time, erect toll booths as only the owner of an essential highway can do.

"You might notice that lots of the things you try to do online today seem slow. But it is not your internet connection, your router or your computer – the internet is staging a protest. It is protesting about the US legislation due to be brought in by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) about “net neutrality” – essentially whether the internet should run at one speed for all companies and services, or should be divided into a fast and a slow lane. If the legislation is successfully passed, companies including Google, YouTube, Netflix and Amazon will probably have to pay for a higher speed internet connection to continue to stream video and other internet services at the same rate they do now to avoid users being infuriated by slow loading times and stuttering video.     Loading   Why is it slow today? 10 September is “internet slowdown day”, organised by Battle for the Net with 68 different internet companies and organisations to illustrate what the internet could be like if the laws are passed and the internet is divided into a fast and a slow lane. What’s happening? The internet isn’t really slowing down. The companies involved – which include Twitter, Reddit, Netflix, Vimeo and Mozilla – are just simulating, and will place symbols like the spinning pinwheel or other loading-style animations on their site to make it seem like the internet is slowing down. Who’s involved? Almost all the big-name US streaming or image sites are taking part, including Netflix and Vimeo, as are image site Imgur, Tumblr, news sites like Digg and Reddit, plus Firefox browser developer Mozilla and WordPress, which powers some of the biggest blogs on the internet. Twitter and the crowdfunding site Kickstarter are also taking part. The majority of the companies are based in the US but also serve users in the UK and around the world. What can I do? The protest will try to illustrate what the internet could be like with the new US legislation and will lead users to sign a petition to the US Congress to stop the proposed rules from the FCC. For those who just want rid of the banners, loading screens and simulated slow internet, wait a day and it should all be over. Of course, your internet might actually be slow today, but rebooting your router normally fixes that. • Net neutrality: an internet slowdown • Net neutrality: what is it and why does it matter?",2014-09-10T11:23:29Z,Battle for the net: why is my internet slow today?,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-06fdf1a3-8dad-4dbf-8441-57d6843f09ee""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/10/1410347113460/9938fe93-d709-4abf-a932-bfb0856d5af3-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""laptop internet"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Internet “go slow” day protests against new net neutrality laws in the US hit today.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>",38,Technology firms are protesting against an end to net neutrality in the US by simulating a slowdown of their websites and services.

"Two of the world’s biggest porn sites have promised “in-your-face” support for next week’s “battle for the net” protest against proposals by US regulators to create online fast lanes for some companies. Pornhub and Redtube, two of the world’s largest pornography sites, on Friday announced they would join the “go-slow” day of action planned for 10 September. The porn giants join others including Reddit, Mozilla and Etsy in protest against plans by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) to allow cable and telecoms firms to create fast lanes for some customers. Critics charge such a move would end “net neutrality” — the principle that all traffic is equal on the internet — and lead to the stifling of competition and innovation online. “We’ll be displaying an official widget from battleforthenet.com. We won’t be shutting down or streaming your porn slower. There will be a big in your face message that users will need to close. We hope to reach around 50 million people on Sept 10th,” a Pornhub spokeswoman wrote on Reddit. Both Pornhub and Redtube are owned by Mindgeek, a Luxembourg-based conglomerate that claims to be one of the top five bandwidth consumers in the world, generating 1.7bn visits per month. Most of the world’s largest tech companies, including Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix, have come out against proposals being discussed by the FCC to create fast lanes for higher-paying companies. But the top tier firms have yet to sign on for next week’s protest. Sites participating in the slowdown will display prominent messages including an infinitely spinning “site loading” icon – the so-called “spinning wheel of death” – to symbolise what surfing the web could be like without net neutrality.  The alerts will direct the sites’ users to a site with contacts for policymakers in Washington so they can register their support for net neutrality. A similar email and telephone campaign at the end of the FCC’s public consultation period on the proposed changes led to the regulator’s systems crashing. The crash followed an attack on its net neutrality proposals by comedian John Oliver. The FCC is also considering reclassifying internet service as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Telecommunications Act. That move would hand the FCC far more power over the industry and is being vigorously contested by the cable and telecoms companies.

"Some of the world’s largest tech firms are planning a “go slow” day next week in protest of proposals that could create fast lanes on the internet for some companies. On 10 September, tech firms including Etsy, FourSquare, KickStarter, Mozilla, Reddit and Vimeo will install a widget on their sites to show how they believe the internet would look if the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) overturns “net neutrality” rules. The FCC is currently redrawing its rules after a series of legal challenges from cable and telecoms companies undermined its authority to regulate the internet. One proposal could allow internet service providers to offer fast lanes to higher paying customers, a move critics charge would break net neutrality – the principle that all traffic is treated equally online. Evan Greer, co-founder of Fight for the Future, a pressure group helping to organise the protest day, said in an email: “Net neutrality is tough to explain to people, so we wanted to organize an action that actually shows the world what’s at stake. I think the three most hated words on the internet right now are ‘Please wait, loading ... ’ Unless internet users unite in defense of net neutrality, we could be seeing those dreaded ‘loading’ wheels a lot more often on some of our favorite websites, while monopolistic companies get to decide which content gets seen by the most people.” Several other large internet companies are expected to back the day of action, which is being coordinated by Silicon Valley lobby group Engine. Engine will direct people to call or email policymakers with their concerns. A similar campaign led to the FCC being flooded with comments on the net neutrality legislation – so many that at one point its systems collapsed under the strain.  “With over one million public comments already filed with the FCC, much has been written about why the FCC’s proposed rules would damage the internet, but the FCC needs to see firsthand how Internet fast lanes would devastate startups,” Engine said in a blogpost. The FCC is redrafting its rules at the same time as it assesses the proposed merger of Comcast, the largest cable company, with Time Warner, the second largest. The FCC is also reviewing a proposal to overturn state laws that ban some local municipalities from expanding their own high speed internet service to compete with the cable companies.",2014-09-04T12:18:19Z,Large US tech firms plan 'go slow' day in protest over net neutrality rules,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-7ae07c5b-f480-465b-bfcd-8f942e15e500""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/4/1409832664805/b15da7ea-8c2d-4fc1-8bab-dd17acc81111-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""net neutrality"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Several other large internet companies are expected to back the day of action, which is being coordinated by Silicon Valley lobby group Engine. </span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>",40,"On 10 September, Etsy, Foursquare, Kickstarter, Reddit and others will alter websites, to show potential impact of FCC decision",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/4/1409832665349/5311bfb7-a80a-42b1-8faf-affb62a00a2f-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/04/etsy-mozilla-reddit-protest-net-neutrality,9,positive
"Want to know if someone is internet-savvy? Just ask them why anyone should care about&nbsp;net neutrality. If they understand the technology, stand by for a lecture on why it is vital that all data on the network should be treated equally by ISPs, and why it is essential that those who provide the pipes connecting us to&nbsp;the network should have no influence on the content that flows through those pipes.On the other hand, if the person knows no more about the net than the average LOLcat enthusiast, you will be greeted by a blank stare: ""Net what?""If, dear reader, you fall into neither category but would like to know more, two options are available: a visit to the excellent Wikipedia entry on the subject or comedian John Oliver's devastatingly sharp explication of net neutrality on YouTube.The principle that all bits traversing the network should be treated equally was a key feature of the internet's original design. It was also one of the reasons why the internet became such an enabler of disruptive innovation. Net neutrality meant that the bits generated by a smart but unknown programmer's application, for instance the web, file-sharing, Skype and Facebook, would be treated the same as bitstreams emanating from a giant corporation. Neutrality kept the barrier to entry low.So far, so good. But the problem with general principles, however admirable, is that they sometimes create inflexibility. In that sense, net neutrality is like the principle that one should never, ever, tell a lie, not even a small one: excellent in principle, unfeasible in practice. The internet works by breaking each communication into small data packets and dispatching them, often by different routes, to their destination, where they are reassembled into the original communication. This was fine in the early days, when most communications were files and emails, and it didn't matter if the packets failed to arrive in an orderly stream. But once innovations such as internet telephony, streaming audio and video emerged, it looked like a good idea to give them privileged treatment because otherwise quality was degraded.When media corporations such as Netflix came along, they were outraged that their bits had to travel in the same third-class carriages as everybody else's. Which, of course, led big ISPs to the idea that they could put those bitstreams into a fast lane and charge their owners accordingly, thereby earning more revenue and throwing neutrality out of the window.In the US, the neutrality buck stops with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), historically a doughty supporter of the principle. Since last January, however, the FCC has been impaled on the horns of an appeal court decision. Verizon, the huge US ISP, successfully challenged the FCC's rules on neutrality. The court ruled that the commission did not have the right to prevent Verizon from&nbsp;charging a fee for traffic carried on its network and since that point Verizon has been billing Netflix for providing a fast lane for its content to Verizon subscribers.Mulling its options in April, the FCC concluded that, to stay within the law, it would have to allow ISPs to charge for providing fast lanes so long as the terms were ""commercially reasonable"". Anticipating the outrage that this violation of the neutrality principle would generate, the commission put the draft ruling out for a period of public consultation that closed on 15 July.You can imagine what happened. The commission was deluged by public comments, most of them online. It had to add extra capacity to cope with the fallout from Oliver's broadcast. By deadline day, it had received nearly a million submissions, the vast majority of which were probably hostile to the proposed new ruling.Also received were a much smaller number of submissions from corporations. Verizon, for example, filed a 184-page comment written by five lawyers. Comcast, another huge ISP, submitted a 71-page document. Other companies (internet giants and telecoms mainly) did much the same.Guess which submissions the FCC will take seriously?You know the answer. All the public submissions will be read and most of them rejected. This not because FCC officials are biased or corrupt. It's just that they can't do anything with expressions of outrage or affirmations of values. They're charged by Congress with making rules that can stand up to legal challenge. They need submissions that have evidence and arguments, things that most laypeople are not in a position to provide. Sad but true: even in a democracy, rulemaking can't be done by plebiscite, online or off. And that noise you're hearing is the ghost of Edmund Burke cheering.",2014-07-26T19:00:00Z,Net neutrality is dead – welcome to the age of digital discrimination,,41,"<p>A US appeal court ruling that undermines the principle of net neutrality could spell the end for the ideal of an open internet, writes <strong>John Naughton</strong></p>",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2014/7/24/1406205235688/John-Oliver-004.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/26/net-neutrality-dead-age-of-digital-discrimination-is-here,4,positive
"The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was forced to extend the deadline for comments over its controversial plans to change the way it regulates the internet, after its systems were overwhelmed by thousands of new submissions. By Tuesday afternoon, more than 780,000 comments had been submitted to the regulator over its proposed “open internet” rules that have cable companies, politicians, consumers and activists at loggerheads over the future of the internet. Thousands more submissions were expected before the planned deadline of midnight Tuesday, as activists and consumer groups rallied supporters to lobby the FCC to moved: protect “net neutrality” - the concept that all traffic on the internet should be treated equally – and stop cable companies setting up high-speed “fast lanes” for some customers. The FCC, which has struggled to get Congress to fund an upgrade to its antiquated systems, has now extended the deadline to midnight Friday. A second round of comments on the original submissions will then begin, ending in September, with the FCC expected to make its ruling by the end of the year. “Not surprisingly, we have seen an overwhelming surge in traffic on our website that is making it difficult for many people to file comments through our electronic comment filing system (ECFS). Please be assured that the commission is aware of these issues and is committed to making sure that everyone trying to submit comments will have their views entered into the record,” said FCC spokeswoman Kim Hart. Amazon, Google, Facebook, Reddit, Twitter and others submitted a joint comment Monday arguing against an FCC proposal that would allow broadband providers to charge websites for faster service as long as the arrangements are &quot;commercially reasonable.&quot; The Internet Association, a lobby group representing dozens of major tech firms, wrote to the FCC arguing the proposal is a direct threat to the concept of net neutrality. “Segregation of the internet into fast lanes and slow lanes will distort the market, discourage innovation and harm internet users,” said Michael Beckerman, president and CEO of The Internet Association. “The FCC must act to create strong, enforceable net neutrality rules and apply them equally to both wireless and wireline providers.” But the association stopped short of calling for the internet to be regulated as a utility, a proposal that would give the FCC far greater powers, and which the cable companies are lobbying against fiercely. Consumer groups including Common Cause, Fight for the Future (FFTF) and Free Press are pushing for that idea, arguing that the internet should be reclassified as a “common carrier” like the telephone system, which would allow the FCC to ban tiered charging. “The FCC has the power to do that,” said FFTF’s Evan Greer. “At this stage it’s clear that the public want real net neutrality, and that anything short of that is just another example to the undue influence wielded by cable companies in the corridors of power.” Comcast, Time Warner and their cable rivals argue that tighter regulation would deter investment and likely fail in the courts. The FCC is being forced to redraw its rules after a court defeat narrowed the extent of its regulatory powers. The National Cable and Telecommunications Association (NCTA) is expected to file its submission later Tuesday. In a blogpost, the lobby group called on the FCC to reject “extreme voices that wrongly suggest that the only acceptable course for the commission to take is to turn back the clock on progress by reclassifying broadband as a title II common carrier service. “For well over a decade, Democratic and Republican policymakers confronted with the promise of high-speed internet access have embraced a ‘light touch’ regulatory model that has spurred unprecedented levels of investment in our nation’s broadband infrastructure.” Comments to the FCC received a major boost after comedian John Oliver attacked the proposals last month on his HBO show Last Week Tonight. “What&apos;s being proposed is so egregious that activists and corporations have been forced onto the same side,” said Oliver. He attacked FCC chairman Tom Wheeler, a former cable company lobbyist, saying his appointment was “the equivalent of needing a babysitter and hiring a dingo.&quot; So far, the number of comments the FCC has received on its open internet plans trails well behind the 1.4m comments submitted following Janet Jackson’s notorious “wardrobe malfunction&quot; during the 2004 Super Bowl.",2014-07-15T19:17:06Z,FCC extends deadline for user comments on net neutrality,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-be01c9a3-efd5-4bb0-b6cf-d1931fa0b721""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/15/1405451022822/a0107dea-082f-4204-935b-14d784c85203-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Democratic senator Al Franken speaks about net neutrality during a discussion hosted by the Free Press Action Fund on Capitol Hill."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Democratic senator Al Franken speaks about net neutrality during a discussion hosted by the Free Press Action Fund on Capitol Hill.

"If you, like me, are one of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who has recently asked the Federal Communications Commission to support an open internet, congratulations: you may actually have made a difference. So many people posted pre-deadline responses on Tuesday about how the regulator will oversee the future of the internet that its public-comment filing page nearly crashed, prompting an extension until this Friday night. The outpouring to support what&apos;s generally called &quot;network neutrality&quot; has taken the form of letters and official filings to the FCC website, as well as more public campaigns in recent months. It&apos;s been gratifying to watch, but don&apos;t get your hopes up: the FCC chairman, former cable and wireless industry lobbyist Tom Wheeler, floated the idea of internet &quot;fast lanes&quot; earlier this year – and he&apos;ll probably to turn the web into a somewhat enhanced form of cable TV anyway.  Officially, the FCC says it will read and reply to you by September, then make an official ruling on whether all web traffic should be treated equally. That decision, probably later this year, will have an enormous impact on our digital futures, because an internet controlled by huge and unaccountable corporations is anathema to digital innovation and free speech itself. What should we be doing in this interim, and into the future? We need to keep up the pressure, because you can be sure that Big Telecom – which has patience, massive amounts of money and deep ties with lawmakers and regulators – will be doing precisely that. You can count on the big carriers – the Comcasts and the Verizons – to churn up a propaganda storm in coming months, supplementing their mega-million-dollar lobbying campaign in Washington. There will be the usual statements, which often turn out to be misleading or outright false, from official spokespeople. But watch out for the less obvious stuff – the opinion laundering via the telecoms&apos; legion of front groups and other allies, many of whom are being paid for their help. Those allies will range from unions to think tanks to academics to advocacy organizations that, at first glance, have no reason to be taking a stand on something as basic as internet traffic. And the telecoms will no doubt hope that the journalists who quote these people won&apos;t check to see if that&apos;s what&apos;s going on. There will, of course, be some of this on the pro-net neutrality side. I&apos;m no fan of hidden agendas, even when I agree with them, but I&apos;m confident that the people who want an open Internet have every reason, unlike those who want corporate control, to stand behind their own words on this issue.  This is an election year. If you care about the freedom of information, you should grill the people who are running for office where you live – and vote and donate your time and money accordingly.  If they&apos;re running for local office, get them on the record in support of publicly financed local broadband networks. If they&apos;re running for state office, get them on the record for blocking or repealing laws that would prohibit such publicly funded networks and other competition. If they want to go to Congress, get them on the record for net neutrality, expanded unlicensed wireless spectrum, stronger antitrust regulation of the ISPs, and federal pre-emption of laws blocking local competition.  Net neutrality is so important to me that I might well vote for someone whose positions on many other issues were counter to my own, as long as he or she persuaded me of a commitment to an open internet. I&apos;m skeptical that the right policy will prevail whenever massively funded and politically connected interests want something. I&apos;m doubly skeptical in this case given Wheeler&apos;s background: Occam&apos;s Razor tells you President Obama appointed a telecom insider who lobbied for the industry to do that industry&apos;s bidding. Yet once in a while, bad policies – even ones where the outcome seems preordained – can be averted. The blocking of the infamous Stop Online Piracy Act (Sopa), which was outright internet censorship that would also have curbed innovation, occurred only after a massive outpouring of anger from concerned citizens like you and me, as well as many of the biggest internet companies themselves.  Trouble is, this time the biggest internet companies have been awfully quiet. A filing in favor of net neutrality earlier this week by one of their lobbying groups was way too little, if not way too late. And it&apos;s easier – by far – to block something bad than to persuade hostile or risk-averse politicians and regulators to change policies.

"The net neutrality debate has focused in America on wired lines – not mobile. But what just happened in Chile is a precursor to the real battle in at least the medium term: the mobile internet. Chile&apos;s telecommunications regulator, the Subsecretaria de Telecomunicaciones, recently imposed some short-term pain on some of the nation&apos;s internet users, hoping to ensure a long-term gain: Chileans&apos; ability to make their own choices about how they want to use the internet. Mobile carriers had wanted to partner with giant internet services (including Facebook and Google) to offer what they call &quot;zero-rating&quot; connections: an increasingly common arrangement in which mobile phone customers got no-cost mobile data as long as they used those specific services. But the regulator instead insisted that Chile&apos;s network neutrality law meant what it said, and nixed those arrangements. Those of us who believe that the principle of net neutrality is crucial to a truly open internet – the kind of web required to ensure innovation and free speech – need to recognize that in many places, including the United States, we&apos;ve already lost the near-term battle when it comes to mobile. The carriers, supported by regulators and even supposedly open-internet-friendly companies like Google, have seized control, re-centralizing a medium that was designed to be decentralized. This is a dangerous mistake. In America and Europe in particular, internet use is going mobile at a rapid rate, largely due to its convenience – but, in much of the developing world, mobile essentially is the internet. Zero-rating services are training people to believe that Facebook Zero, Twitter Zero et al are synonymous with what it means to be online.  Defenders of these arrangements have one reasonable argument: without zero-rated services, a lot of people wouldn&apos;t be online at all. Think of the benefits, they say, while downplaying or even ignoring the long-range damage to the open internet. The non-neutral mobile internet emerges from the assumption that mobile networks are so bandwidth-constrained that carriers must heavily tinker with what users can do and impose penurious data caps. So why do people in Finland pay a small fraction of the price for much more mobile bandwidth – which they use – than people in Germany, Spain and the US? It&apos;s simple, according to persuasive research from a Helsinki consultancy, Rewheel: Finland has genuine competition not dominated by an dominant state-preferred (or owned) carrier. According to Rewheel, the dominant European carriers are trying to create a &quot;digital OPEC&quot; – a cartel designed to maintain high prices. In America, meanwhile, two national mobile carriers already have a dominant market share: Verizon and AT&amp;T are far ahead of Sprint and T-Mobile – and a host of smaller companies that resell minutes and data from the networks of big carriers. For its part, AT&amp;T is planning an &quot;over the top&quot; service that will maintain data caps but not charge for &quot;Sponsored Data&quot; – a blatant slap at net neutrality. Meanwhile, Sprint wants to buy T-Mobile, arguing that a combined company will have the needed heft to truly compete with Verizon and AT&amp;T. But it seems much more likely that a &quot;SprinT-mobile&quot; would simply join the big guys to create a cartel that ratchets up the caps and prices for phone users, and makes special deals with &quot;data sponsors&quot;. The competition policy people at the US Justice Department – in a rare example of it doing its job under the Obama administration – already blocked AT&amp;T from buying T-Mobile – a deal that would have been even worse, to be sure – but the smart money seems to be betting that this one will be approved. A Sprint / T-Mobile deal would be just the latest in a global race for media/telecom consolidation. In Europe, German chancellor Angela Merkel has actually called for more telecom mergers. The European Union&apos;s chief antitrust official objected to Merkel&apos;s approach, but cross-border consolidation seems more likely to proceed than stop.  We could well be headed toward an era in the not too distant future in which a handful of telecom carriers – with national units allied with governments – dominate global communications. Meanwhile, we keep hearing a common refrain: everything is going mobile. In Silicon Valley, internet startups almost always say that they are &quot;mobile first&quot; and the traditional web second. It&apos;s true that users, especially younger ones, prefer mobile devices to desktop and laptop computers. But a mobile-first strategy will put startups and established companies alike – including news organizations – under the thumb of an industry that will, sooner than later, be extracting tribute from every company that wants to do business on the mobile internet. So I&apos;m baffled that we&apos;re framing network neutrality in such a constrained way. We definitely need to save it for our wired-line services. But if we ignore the ways in which mobile carriers are trying to create a new cartel of their own, we&apos;ll be in even worse trouble.",2014-06-06T10:15:02Z,A government ruled for net neutrality.

"The US Federal Communications Commission website reported technical difficulties because of heavy traffic this week hours after comedian John Oliver called on viewers to share their thoughts with the agency about what he called “cable company fuckery”.    We’ve been experiencing technical difficulties with our comment system due to heavy traffic. We’re working to resolve these issues quickly.&mdash; The FCC (@FCC) June 2, 2014      We’re still experiencing technical difficulties with our comment system. Thanks for your patience as we work to resolve the issues.&mdash; The FCC (@FCC) June 2, 2014    On Sunday’s episode of the HBO show Last Week Tonight, Oliver encouraged viewers to take advantage of the 120-day open commenting period on the FCC’s Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet proposal and tell the government what they thought of the plan. “Good evening, monsters,” Oliver said, before urging online commenters to submit their comments to the agency&apos;s site. Critics say the FCC&apos;s plan would destroy net neutrality because it creates a “tiered internet” where companies could pay for higher speed access. To maintain net neutrality, they argue, internet should be classified and regulated like a utility. Oliver&apos;s 13-minute description of the net neutrality debate was decidedly negative toward the FCC&apos;s plan, comparing TV and internet provider Comcast to a defence contractor for the amount of money it has spent lobbying for a tiered internet. “We need you to get out and, for once in your lives, focus your indiscriminate rage in a useful direction,” Oliver said. “Seize your moment my lovely trolls, turn on caps lock, and fly my pretties, fly, fly!” And, it would appear, they did. Just after the segment aired on HBO, Last Week Tonight, and its fans, said the FCC comment feature was not working. The FCC confirmed that its system was experiencing technical difficulties because of heavy traffic on Monday, after Oliver&apos;s video was posted and widely shared online.

One comment published on Tuesday blasted &quot;cable company fuckery,&quot; using Oliver&apos;s line.

"Your TV is living in the dark ages.  At least, that&apos;s according to Neil Hunt, the chief product officer at Netflix.  Hunt, who delivered a keynote speech at the 2014 Internet Week in New York, predicts that personalization and on-demand viewing and streaming are really the way of the future when it comes to entertainment. They are also part of his plan to have Netflix defeat its rivals in entertainment. Netflix, which was founded in 1997, has 48 million subscribers worldwide and in the first quarter of 2014 streamed 6.5bn hours of entertainment, bringing in revenue of over $1bn. Though subscriber growth has slowed in recent years, the company&apos;s plan to hike prices has won cheers from Wall Street.  But the competition is getting tougher – Amazon is in the ring now – and Netflix needs a plan. Hunt told the audience in New York, “Our vision is you won’t see a grid and you won’t see a sea of titles. Instead you’ll see one or two perfect suggestions that perfectly capture what you want to watch right now depending on your mood and who is with you, who is sitting with you at the TV right now. I think this version is possible.”  The traditional TV, or &quot;linear TV&quot; as Hunt refers to it, is limited by the 24-hour grid based on which it plans its programming, which creates a tyranny from shows seen as popular.  The limitations of such a model have often led to demise of shows with niche appeal or cult-like following. Such shows, while failing to attract enough viewers to secure a second or third season on network television, have found many fans when streamed online – think Firefly, which was the subject of Neflix’s April’s Fool prank this year, or Arrested Development, which was revived by Netflix last year for a fourth season. Netflix sees itself as a way to restore television justice, Hunt suggests.  “Common criticism I hear is that we carry a lot of old shows, some call them junk. But I have a different perspective. There are no bad shows, but there are many shows with small and devoted audiences,” explained Hunt. “And internet TV, not subject to the tyranny of the grid, can afford to carry those small shows.”     Hunt seems to argue that 'linear TV' is, like GOB of Arrested Development, struggling to shed certain illusions. Photograph: REX/c20thCFox/Everett    While speaking at the Code Conference earlier this week, Reed Hastings, Netflix co-founder and CEO, said that Netflix will not use data to influence its original content. Hastings noted that David Fincher, who helped direct the first season of House of Cards, did not want to know that number of users turned off the show after Frank Underwood&apos;s character strangles a dog. Instead of using data to determine how its series&apos; characters should behave or whether they should live or die, Netflix uses its data to determine which users it should promote its content to. The flexibility of internet TV doesn’t just open the doors to more diverse programming, but also to the way that the stories are told in terms of length and languages. The first of Netflix&apos; original series, Lilyhammer, was released in Norway in 2012 and much of it is in Norwegian. Expect a more global feel. Recently, Netflix announced that it was expanding into six more European countries.  Yet even as the company embarks on the mission to change the way people watch TV around the world, it&apos;s facing a war back in the US. At home, Netflix is currently battling the internet service providers over net neutrality - the access to their cable bandwidth, necessary in order to stream its contents to the subscribers. “We would rather beat our internet TV competitors by providing superior service than by being the biggest one who can afford to pay the bills that internet service providers would like to charge,” Hunt said on the topic of net neutrality. We caught up with Hunt to talk about his management experience, Netflix’s stance on the issue of net neutrality, the future of internet TV, and why Netflix subscribers shouldn&apos;t feel guilty about binge-watching their favorite shows.      Neil Hunt's keynote speech at 2014 Internet Week in New York City.    What piece of advice would you give someone based on your experience? Hire fully grown adults and treat them as adults. Has your role at Netflix changed over the years as the company has grown? Well, it&apos;s hard to go from a startup with 20, 30 people in it to an organization that has over a thousand people in it without learning a lot of stuff along the way. Certainly, the Netflix culture that has been widely discussed and written about has been a product of trying to understand what it would take to grow without losing the nimbleness and effectiveness that characterized the early years of Netflix.  And so, the idea behind &quot;performance culture&quot; [and] &quot;freedom and responsibility&quot; – both of those concepts came out of a lot of debate and the early 2000s as we were scaling and growing.       Sheryl Sandberg previously referred to the 'Netflix Culture: Freedom and Responsibility' PowerPoint deck as one of the most important documents ever to come out of Silicon Valley.    You&apos;re the head of product at Netflix. Clearly, the product has changed quite a bit since 1997, when it started as a DVD distribution company. Where is the product going next? The shift from DVD to streaming began in about 2007 and accelerated in 2011 and at this point is essentially accomplished as far as I can see. It feels fairly straightforward and simple. It&apos;s just a substitution of a different delivery vehicle, but actually there&apos;s more to it than that. The proposition that we offered to the customers of our DVD service was a proposition to be able to get any DVD – essentially any DVD that was released – but with limits of the postal service delays and so on and so forth. The typical subscriber would consume two or three DVDs a month.  That&apos;s a very different proposition from today in the streaming world, where we don&apos;t seek to carry everything. We seek to carry the compelling library of content that&apos;s available immediately as much as people want to watch. A typical subscriber today is watching 30 to 40 hours a month of Netflix content. That&apos;s a huge shift upwards and, of course, the DVD and the streaming plans are both essentially the same price – $8 or $9.     Taylor Schilling as Piper Chapman in Orange is the New Black. Photograph: Jessica Miglio/Netflix    That fact that there&apos;s so much more available on the streaming plan is really quite a different proposition. That leads to a lot of technology changes along the way.  The one that I like to point to is the queue, which DVD users would remember as being the queue of the DVDs they want shipped to them in the order that they wanted to receive them. That worked well for the DVD business, but we were not sufficiently thoughtful as we brought that to the streaming world. And the idea of an ordered list of titles that you would want to watch doesn&apos;t really make sense when you can pick anything right now and watch it. It makes much more sense to think about it as an un-ordered collection of titles you want to see, where Netflix can apply the personalization, the recommendations algorythms that we spent a lot of time and effort [developing] to pick out from the un-ordered list the set of titles that would be interesting. That actually makes the queue become My List, which becomes a dramatically more powerful vehicle. A simple change, but lot more power comes out of it. It seems that Netflix appeals to a variety of demographics – parents with kids that need to be entertained, teens, couples, truckers who use it to pass the time while stuck at a truck stop. Who would you say are your users?  We have consciously reached out to try to provide a service for people who love it, anyone of any different description of variety. I like to think that where as all television might have dealt with channels and there would be a handful of channels that a teen would watch and then channels that your father would watch.  At Netflix, we think to provide 48m different channels for 48 million different subscribers. And we use all of our personalization technology to look to understand the taste and interests of each of those different customers and then to match that up against everything we know about our content. So &quot;recommendations and suggestions&quot; sounds too straight forward, but essentially the selection of content that your son would see on his home screen is very different from the selection from the content that your father would see according to how different their tastes are. It&apos;s not like we are trying to force a particular choice on each of those consumers, we are trying to make sure they have acceptable choices at their fingertips, the choices that appeal to them. That&apos;s really what&apos;s it all about. It really is about trying to have a separate, distinct channel for each customer.      David Fincher says he tried to create Kevin Spacey's character without regard to audience preferences.    Speaking of recommendations, I&apos;m a huge fan of House of Cards. How do these original shows like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black play into your bigger goal? I think we are going to end up doing a lot more originals over time. The world of internet TV kind of means that not all shows have to be 13 episodes times 42 minutes. That&apos;s a new freedom – the idea that a story can have long segments and short segments and that you don&apos;t have to end each 42-minute segment with a tidbit of the next one because you know that people are going to be watching several in the row. The freedom is really that we get to develop by working directly with the producer and the team to cross new kinds of storytelling. The best way to do that is to do it ourselves, to do our own original work and really have the agenda for how that moves forward. When you look at House of Cards and Orange is the New Black and several others of the originals, you will see that the storytelling is deeper and richer, but I think we have a ways to go. We haven&apos;t yet cracked the idea that the episodes all need to be 42 minutes long.  So the idea is maybe you have a 15-minute episode and maybe you have a 19-minute episode with a break in the middle. And that&apos;s fine. Chapters in a book are a different length. And so I think as we do more and more work in the space, and as we have more and more rights to the content we will need to syndicate it out for getting exposure on more conventional linear television, we will have more and more freedom to change the format going forward. Netflix has taken TV marathons and binge watching to a whole new level. I myself am guilty of it quite often. Do you find it interesting or amusing how Netflix has changed the way that people watch a show? Binge watching … that term carries some connotations of guilt, which you echo. You know, I don&apos;t think anyone would say that reading two chapters of a book in a row is binge reading. It&apos;s just a natural way to consume the story. If you get into it, you want to get on and see how it develops and unfolds. It also gives us interesting opportunity to do a marketing campaign around watching responsibly. I think it&apos;s just a great natural way for people to engage with a compelling story.      A 2013 Netflix ad warned subscribers to 'Watch responsibly.'   Let&apos;s talk about developing product with input from the consumer. What&apos;s the role of the subscribers in building out Netflix? How do you usually interact with them? Well, we are a very data-driven culture. We love to use A/B testing. If we have an idea we like to build most of it, then put it in front of a lot of people, maybe half a million people.  As a person uses the product, see if it behaves, we see if it works better, see if customers watch longer or retain better with the new version of the product that we have built. That&apos;s worked pretty well. And of course, the ideas that we have put into tests don&apos;t come out of thin air. They often come out of customers&apos; suggestions. They come out of focus groups and quantitative sessions where we watch customers interact with our products and we talk with them.  We do a lot of that kind of work, too. We try to be very responsive to what people actually want – what will generate more viewing hours, more retention, more engagement with the server. Whatever we can do to advance that movement forward, that&apos;s what we will seek to do.  We have been hearing a lot about net neutrality. A lot of it, however, seems to be removed from the actual consumer. Has there been any communication between your subscribers and Netflix? Have they expressed any concern on the issue? I don&apos;t think customers care or necessarily should care too much about the details of net neutrality, but they should care about the outcome. The issue at stake here is – the number you hear bandied around here a lot is that Netflix represents a third of the internet. That&apos;s sort of missing the point. The bottom line is the average Netflix stream is two megabits-a-second, where what consumers are paying for is 10 or 20 megabits-a-second. And so it&apos;s not really a third of the internet traffic, it&apos;s actually about 10% of what you&apos;ve already paid for. Essentially, if the internet service provider wants to charge the providers like Netflix for the right to provide the traffic or for the right to give the internet service provider the traffic that their customers have requested and paid for, feels like double dipping. That&apos;s our statement so far.     An activist is pulled away as he protests during an open meeting on internet regulation. Photograph: Alex Wong/Getty Images    If it were a competitive market, if there were several different internet service providers serving you, the customer, and some could offer net neutrality and some not, then the market would discipline the internet service providers that under-provide it, or overcharge, and we would have fair price set for what it takes to exchange the bits.  But the reality in this country is that we don&apos;t really have competition for which cable provider you really get your broadband from. That leads to a situation where that broadband provider can pretty much charge whatever they want for the internet connection with no constraint. We don&apos;t think that&apos;s a realistic model. We think the right outcome here is for a place where internet service provider gets to take the bits to its edge network at no cost and where Netflix pays to bring the bits all the way up. So typically the bits that flow to you may only flow three or five miles from our service to your house.  We think that&apos;s the service that you have paid for with your $80 or $90 a month paid to the internet service provider and that we should get to give those bits to the internet service provider at no charge and they should deliver them with the equal priority across all the different services. So no fast lane, but equally no penalization. That seems like a fair outcome to us. So that&apos;s what we are arguing for as a strong net neutrality condition. It&apos;s interesting to see how this shapes out, but certainly I am not a great fan of what I understand of the current FTC proposed rulemaking in terms and conditions. I think we have some work to do. The key observation is that in UK there really are competitive internet providers. It&apos;s really interesting to us that when we offered to bring Netflix bits directly to wherever the internet provider wants to take them, they are only too eager to embrace and bring them into the network for no charge. So the only place in the world where there is an anti-connect charge discussion is where the broadband provider is not in a particularly competitive market.  Where do you see Netflix going in the next few years?  There&apos;s a lot more people in the world who are enthusiastic about internet TV and we have ambitions to take our original shows and other signature great shows we licensed across the world, country by country, region by region. I think that&apos;s a very exciting growth opportunity in front of us and we don&apos;t need to invent new businesses, we just need to deliver the business that we are working on as widely as possible.

"The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) moved another step closer to drawing up new rules to protect the open internet Thursday as the war of words between cable giants and consumer activists intensified. In a sometimes heated meeting in Washington protesters calling for an open internet were ejected and the two Republican members of the regulator’s five member panel strongly objected to the new proposals.  The panel voted 3-2 along party lines to advance a proposal in which content companies could pay to have their traffic prioritised by broadband providers. The new rules will be finalized after a four-month public consultation period and are expected to be once again challenged by the cable industry. The FCC was effectively left without rules to govern the internet in January after a court defeat in a case against Verizon, which challenged the agency&apos;s powers to regulate the web. FCC chairman Tom Wheeler said: “I strongly support an open internet. This agency supports and open internet … There is one internet, not a fast internet, not a slow internet. One internet,” he said. The FCC had been considering two main proposals for regulating the internet. The first, which is believed to be Wheeler’s preferred option, would see the FCC monitoring any attempts to create a high speed service on a case-by-case basis under Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act. Wheeler has said he would block any deals that are not “commercially reasonable”. The second proposal, supported by consumer groups, activists and many tech companies, would treat broadband internet access as a utility, like electricity or water, as it was until 2002 when president George W Bush separated telecoms communications from “information services”. Redefining broadband as under Title II of the Communications Act would give the FCC more power over companies like Comcast, Verizon and AT&amp;T, which strongly oppose such a measure. The FCC has been bombarded with calls and received over a million emails from people concerned about the impact of the new rules, details of which were leaked weeks ago. Tech giants including Apple, Facebook, Google and Twitter have also expressed concern. Wheeler said “The public response has been tremendous because the stakes are so high.”     FCC chairman Tom Wheeler during an open meeting to receive public comment on proposed open Internet notice. Photograph: Alex Wong/Getty Images    He said the regulator had twice had its rules thrown out by legal challenges from the cable companies. “Today this agency moves to surmount that opposition and to stand up for an open internet for consumers,” he said. Wheeler denied that his proposals would create a “tiered internet” with fast lanes for companies able to pay for higher speed access. Wheeler said his proposed rules would clamp down on any cable company attempting to slow internet access for consumers of startups. He also put forward the idea of an ombudsman to represent consumers in disputes with internet service providers (ISPs). Wheeler was backed by Democrat commissioners Mignon Clyburn and Jessica Rossenworcel. Clyburn said she had been inundated with calls from educators, healthcare professionals, startups and even her mother worried about the open nature of the internet. She said people were right to be concerned. Without rules, she said, there was nothing to stop cable companies not consumers “picking winners”. “There are dozens of examples around the globe where we have seen the dangers to society when people are not allowed to choose. Government blocking access to content and stifling free speech,” she said “The future of the internet is the future of everything,” said Rossenworcel. “We can not have a two tiered internet that supports the privileged and leaves the rest of us lagging behind.” But Republican commissioners Ajit Pai and Michael O’Reilly the FCC was overreaching and its attempts at regulation were likely to be harmful and would fail. Pai said that while there was a bipartisan consensus on a free and open internet the issue was too “fundamental … for us five unelected representatives to decide”. He said two prior attempts to go it alone had ended in court defeats and “I’m not sure the third time will be the charm.” Commissioner Michael O’Reilly said he had “serious concerns that this ill advised item” will be damaging and send the FCC down the “slippery slope of regulation”. “Getting the internet right is more important than getting this done right now.”     Google had argued in favour of net neutrality. Photograph: Georges Gobet/AFP/Getty Images    In a letter to the FCC Wednesday the National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association (NTCA) said it was “wholly unnecessary to pursue a Title II reclassification” and such a move would be “immensely destabilizing and “would discourage network investment necessary to fuel the &apos;virtuous cycle&apos; of deployment, innovation and adoption that the Commission has long sought”. Ahead of the meeting about 100 protesters demonstrated outside the regulator’s Washington headquarters with banners reading Save The Internet and Free Press Requires Free Internet. Some had been sleeping outside the building for days ahead of the meeting. Kevin Zeese, spokesperson for political activist group Popular Resistance, spent the last week sleeping outside the FCC. He was among the protesters ejected from the meeting. Wheeler came out to speak with Zeese and others Wednesday. “He says he wants an open internet and equal access for all. That’s great but I judge a man by what he does not by what he says,” said Zeese. Zeese said cable companies were lobbying hard for less regulation and that he and other protesters would redouble their efforts after the meeting. “Our goal is to overcome Comcast’s lobbying power with people power,” he said. “The FCC should act in the people’s interest. People hate Comcast, they hate Verizon. Does the FCC really want to concentrate more power in their hands?” Evan Greer of digital rights group Fight for the Future, said: “It was a pretty clear example of the stranglehold that telecoms money has on the FCC. Despite protests from the left the right, tech companies and thousands and thousands of people that he won&apos;t just do what is necessary and reclassify internet as a utility and a public good.” Becky Bond, vice-president and political director of Credo Mobile, an independent telecoms company, said failure to pass Tier II would be a disaster for the internet. Credo, which uses profits to fund progressive causes, has organized thousands of calls to the FCC to protest any threat to net neutrality and collected over 300,000 signatures. “A slow moving cave in on net neutrality has been taking place for years. We now have an opportunity for a do-over of a fight that we had lost,” she said. “Now we will see if the FCC will stand up and do what the internet’s users want or whether it will stand back and do what the industry wants.”",2014-05-15T16:38:40Z,FCC nears new net neutrality rules as cable companies and activists feud,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-eee611c2-ab59-4ed7-9f08-9360f8fddf7d""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/15/1400171378720/8a1c64d3-e713-4d10-95b9-257394ca170d-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""net neutrality internet regulation fcc "" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Kevin Zeese, spokesperson for Popular Resistance, is pulled away as he protests during an open meeting on proposed internet regulation.

"The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) meets Thursday to discuss new rules for regulating the internet, bringing the debate about “net neutrality” back to the fore. The FCC was forced to rewrite the rules after its old ones were overturned in January following a court battle with Verizon. Protesters are camping out outside the FCC&apos;s offices and some of the world&apos;s biggest tech firms have written to the regulator expressing concern that the proposals leaked so far offer a “grave threat to the internet.” As is common on the information superhighway, a debate on an issue like net neutrality tends to lead to a great deal of shouting but not much actually being said. So, ahead of the latest in what will be a long string of protests, decisions, rulings and challenges, it&apos;s worth taking a step back and looking at what we&apos;re debating and how we got here. What is is net neutrality? The core principle of net neutrality is a simple one: that all traffic (data) traveling across the internet should be treated the same at each stage of the process. That roughly means that whether a particular packet of data is video from Netflix, HTML from the Guardian, or a P2P file being sent across BitTorrent, it&apos;s given the same priority along the same routes. No-one has priority access, or a &quot;fast lane&quot;. This is one of the key principles around the governance and structure of the internet, and one the FCC and Obama administration have both said they support, though people have their doubts about the FCC&apos;s stance in particular. Why it matters The more lurid of the pro-net neutrality posters and articles get very dramatic about what an abandonment on net neutrality would mean. One particularly dramatic viral image shows an ISP bundle looking more like a cable subscription: charging additional sums each month for access to particular sites or services – $5 for online gaming sites, $5 for international, and so on. It&apos;s certainly scary – no-one wants to be hit in the pocket – but isn&apos;t really the most realistic idea of what an abandonment of net neutrality would likely mean (though it could, in theory, happen down the line). ISPs actually blocking all but permitted content, or even just directly charging customers for particular access would be particularly easy for the FCC, even under its watered-down rules, to challenge. The courts would likely have a similarly easy time against such rulings. What&apos;s more likely Instead, the initial effects to consumers would likely be invisible. ISPs could rather offer prime deals to particular heavy users of bandwidth. The most obvious candidate is, of course, Netflix – a single site which often makes up as much as a third of all internet data usage. Where other video sites like YouTube try to optimise their content, Netflix will generally use as much of the pipe as it can: if there&apos;s lots of bandwidth going, it&apos;ll send UltraHD. Only if the pipe&apos;s slow will it compress and optimise.It&apos;s no exaggeration to say a single stream of one Netflix program can use the same amount of data as a million straightforward web pages, and it&apos;s the ISPs that have to manage that traffic. Why shouldn&apos;t they pay for that access, then? On the surface, it seems reasonable, then, to charge Netflix for their relatively free (or at least cheap) ride: if they&apos;re using so much more bandwidth than anyone else, why not charge them for priority access? Here&apos;s the arguments why not. The first is one of competition: allowing companies to charge for a fast lane completely reshapes how the marketplace works. Let&apos;s say Netflix is willing to pay every US ISP for a special &quot;fast lane&quot; for its data (it has, after a fashion, already cut one such deal). Later, a better competitor comes along: easier to use and cheaper, with better shows, better tech etc, but its relatively slow net connection means it can&apos;t stream at the same quality – its streaming might even be bitty and interrupted. As a startup, it can&apos;t compete with what Netflix is (hypothetically) shelling out to ISPs. And so despite the better tech and content, the challenger fails. An internet without net neutrality moves huge market power to the gatekeepers and the incumbents (of course, you could argue in that example it&apos;s only shifting the monopoly away from rightsholders to pipeholders, but that&apos;s a different issue).A second issue is merely one of fairness. In our homes, ovens use vastly more power each day than lightbulbs. Should, then, oven manufacturers pay electricity companies for all that burdensome work they have to do to keep ovens working – especially when lightbulbs are so low-strain? Generally, we&apos;d see such a concept as ridiculous: the customer pays once, and that&apos;s enough. What&apos;s the FCC doing? So now we come to what the latest challenge – there&apos;ve been many others – to net neutrality is. The agency had previously tried to come up with a fairly good guarantee of net neutrality, which most advocates were relatively happy with.However, this was struck down in January by the appeals court as overly burdensome: the FCC, they said, should specify some circumstances in which it might allow ISPs to prioritise traffic. The agency has responded with a proposal that would use Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act that would assess attempts to prioritise traffic on a case-by-case basis. The proposal either protects or undermines net neutrality, depending on how much you trust the FCC. The new rules would introduce an effective competition test which sets a bar ISPs have to pass in order to prioritise particular traffic. Senior FCC staff promise that bar will be set very high – any deal must prove itself “commercially reasonable”. The FCC is trying to reassure net neutrality advocates that neutrality is safe under such a regime. Critics seem unwilling to stake such a lynchpin of the open internet on assurances. Wise as that seems, the alternative proposal carries heavy risk. What many open internet advocates are calling for is for the FCC to declare that the internet is a utility, like electricity. This would be done under Title II of the Communications Act, which already covers telecommunications services but since 2002 has not covered &quot;information services&quot; – data travelling over the internet. If the FCC reclassified information under Title II, as in the earlier analogy, the data must flow equally, just as power flows across the grid. Such an effort would do much to safeguard net neutrality. If it worked. If it didn&apos;t – and opposition and lobbying against it from the powerful and connected cable companies is already fierce – the FCC has played its last card, its doomsday device. It would have nothing left in its hand: net neutrality in the US would likely be a lost cause.The FCC seems keen to avoid rolling the dice. It wants net neutrality advocates to trust that it&apos;s trying to protect the principle while keeping something in reserve. Advocates fear it&apos;s merely trying to kill neutrality with a whimper, rather than a bang.It all comes down to trust – the one thing everyone seems to be lacking.",2014-05-14T15:54:27Z,Net neutrality: what is it and why does it matter?,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-87e95b10-847c-474b-859a-94a9fef203ff""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/14/1400082219798/70d3c17b-f4ee-4286-b271-216cd6b1bc00-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Ethernet cables"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The new rules would introduce an effective competition test which sets a bar ISPs have to pass in order to prioritise particular traffic.

"The top lawyer at the Federal Communications Commission confirmed on Tuesday that the regulator is considering treating cable companies like utilities as it fights off a wave of protest over the future of the internet. In a live chat on Twitter, Gigi Sohn, the FCC senior counsel for external affairs, said the regulator’s “open internet” proposals, to be published on Thursday, will seek comment on whether broadband internet access should be treated in the same way as electricity, telephone calls or water, where consumers have equal access to the same service. Sohn’s comments give the clearest indication yet about how the FCC is proposing to rewrite the rules on broadband access in the US, following a January court defeat in a case involving Verizon that challenged its powers to regulate the web. “Chairman knows free market won&apos;t protect open internet. That&apos;s why he&apos;s proposing new #FCCNetNeutrality rules – none exist today,” wrote Sohn, as thousands of Twitter users bombarded her with questions. The FCC has faced a mounting backlash from consumer groups and tech firms after chairman Tom Wheeler appeared to signal he was preparing to formalise the creation of a “fast-lane internet” for those able to pay for it. Wheeler has denied that is his intention, but critics charge he has signalled the end to “net neutrality” – the principle that all traffic online is treated equally. Sohn said the FCC was looking at two legal options for protecting an open internet. The first is Title II of the Communications Act, which would regulate companies like Comcast, Verizon and AT&amp;T to “common carrier” rules. Common carrier regulations cover telephone communications and require companies to offer the same service to everyone. In 2002, the FCC reclassified broadband as an “information service”, not a “telecommunications service” – paving the way for a decade of legal battles. In January, the FCC’s previous set of broadband rules was struck down in a case with Verizon, a move that paved the way for a tiered service, with cable firms offering faster service for big companies like Netflix. Apple, Facebook, Google, Twitter and a host of other large and small tech companies have written to the FCC arguing that the current proposals offer a “grave threat to the internet”, in a campaign organised by tech lobbyist Engine Advocacy and New America&apos;s Open Technology Institute. On Tuesday Julie Samuels, executive director of Engine Advocacy, wrote to Wheeler: “The only way to provide the certainty that startups need, and to preserve the internet as an open platform for innovation and economic growth, is to enact a bright­line ban on pay­-to-­play paid prioritization and discrimination against applications. In light of the Verizon decision, reclassification under Title II is the only option that provides a clear path to such a rule.” “[The] chairman has always been clear that Title II is a viable option,” said Sohn. But Sohn also confirmed the FCC is also looking at Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act, which gives the FCC authority to regulate broadband on a case by case basis. Wheeler has said he would block any deals that are not “commercially reasonable”. Reclassifying broadband under Title II will inevitably lead to further legal battles with cable firms, which are already pushing for less regulation and are likely to get the support of the two Republican commissioners on the FCC’s five-member panel. But critics charge that using 706 will be a weaker option and is likely to lead to legal challenges on individual cases as cable firms push to offer tiered, premium priced services like the one Netflix recently struck with Comcast. Craig Aaron, the chairman of Free Press, said: “The cable firms will sue either way. My concern with 706 is that I don’t think it will allow the FCC to stop online discrimination. I just don’t think it’s legally sustainable for the FCC to block deals on a case-by-case basis.” Sohn said the FCC was considering 706 because the Verizon decision “gave us a roadmap, and the chairman believes it can be an effective path forward.” But she confirmed the public backlash had led the FCC to look more closely at all its options: “Draft proposal reflects public input several ways, most noticeably more fulsome discussion of Title II,” she wrote. The FCC has been inundated with comments and emails before Thursday’s meeting. Over 1m people have emailed the regulator calling for tougher rules to protect net neutrality. Protesters have set up and Occupy-style camp outside the FCC’s headquarters. During Sohn’s hour-long Twitter conversation, the regulator’s hashtag, #FCCNetNeutrality, became the highest trending hashtag on Twitter. Thousands of questions and comments were submitted. Senator Bernie Sanders tweeted: “We must not let corporations turn profits by putting a price tag on the free flow of ideas.” Broadband for America, a lobby group for cable companies, tweeted: “28 broadband CEOs urge @FCC to protect #openinternet: Title II will impede investment.” Sohn said the FCC would use Twitter again to discuss the proposals once they have been published. The FCC’s commissioners will discuss the new proposals Thursday. If adopted, the public and other interested parties will have until the end of September to comment and a decision is expected by the end of the year. • This article was amended on Wednesday 14 May to clarify that Craig Aaron is the chairman of Free Press, not Common Cause.",2014-05-13T19:58:25Z,FCC considers treating cable firms like utilities in net neutrality debate,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-8d81cc8f-83d9-407c-b2f3-70b172833ddd""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/13/1400010983023/c88068fc-a88d-41d1-9e9e-77a068af6c72-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""NSA Verizon Wireless store "" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Title II of the the Communications Act would regulate companies like Verizon to 'common carrier' rules.

"The head of the Federal Communications Commission, former cable and wireless industry lobbyist Tom Wheeler, may have a battle on his hands over his proposal to create two standards of Internet service and end net neutrality. This is welcome news for anyone who believes in an open Internet.  Now is the time to ratchet up the pressure. So what&apos;s happened since Wheeler first floated his plan to move toward a two-tiered Internet – where companies would pay Internet service providers for special &quot;fast lanes&quot; to get to you and me? Quite a bit.  Open-Internet activists have gone universally berserk – in the best possible way – and are planning a series of protests leading up to a scheduled FCC vote on May 15 about whether to push Wheeler&apos;s proposal toward official rule-making.   Several influential members of Congress are raising an alarm, too, including Democrats Sen. Al Franken (Minnesota) and Rep. Anna Eshoo (California), who represents part of Silicon Valley. Eshoo pointedly noted that the moves by the Obama-appointed FCC chairman are a flat betrayal of President Obama&apos;s 2008 campaign promises.   Two Democratic FCC commissioners have expressed misgivings about the proposal. One of them, Jessica Rosenworcel, has urged a one-month delay in the vote. (Wheeler has said he&apos;ll proceed with the vote as scheduled.)   And, somewhat belatedly, a large group of technology companies – along with several major business organizations – have written an open letter to the FCC, saying the two-tier proposals are dangerous to the future of the Internet. Among the signatories were Google, Facebook and Amazon (though one of the letter&apos;s organizers, Marvin Ammori, told me that the small and medium-sized companies were the principal drivers in this effort).  The smaller Internet companies asked their users and customers to protest to Congress – but that&apos;s not enough. The large companies need to do what they did when they helped kill the odious Stop Online Piracy Act (which would have eliminated so-called &quot;safe harbor&quot; provisions and made every company legally responsible for any user&apos;s post). Back then, companies large and small demonstrated what might happen were the law to pass by going dark for a day. Tech investor (and my friend) Brad Feld suggested on Wednesday that they do it again. In a blog post entitled &quot;Dear Internet: Let&apos;s Demo the Slow Lane&quot; he called on Internet companies to let the world see what Wheeler&apos;s proposal would actually mean:  Let the world see &quot;Waiting for&quot;, &quot;Connecting&quot;, and &quot;Buffering&quot; show up in their browser continuously throughout the day. Explain what is going on. Then click a button to bypass the Slow Lane and get normal connectivity. Instead of everyone getting tangled up in the legal question of what &quot;net neutrality&quot; means, consumers can see what could happen if / when ISPs can decide which companies get to use their fast lanes by paying extra and who is relegated to the slow lane.  The big companies need to launch their lobbyists and political action committees into the fray as well. They need to push hard for measures from Congress that would create genuine competition again among Internet service providers. If they don&apos;t, we&apos;ll know where the Googles, Facebooks, Amazons and such actually stand – waiting to see if they can profit more by collaborating with the telecom companies&apos; ongoing shakedown of middlemen and content providers (above and beyond their already overpriced &quot;consumer&quot; service). Meanwhile, it&apos;s up to the rest of us to tell Washington – starting with our own letters to the FCC and your representatives – that we need an open Internet, not the cable-TV-on-steroids system that the Comcasts, Verizons, AT&amp;Ts and other oligopoly carriers have planned for us.",2014-05-08T20:37:18Z,The best way to protest net neutrality's end is with an Internet-wide slowdown,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-a5371e03-5b79-4d09-947f-dd273d3e2b17""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/8/1399580661064/5b722072-b3b9-4781-a496-f1b5f1d4c1f6-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""woman computer"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Should consumers get an early taste of the two-tiered internet?

"Protesters set up camp outside the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) on Wednesday to fight plans they say will create a two-tier internet and hand control of the web to major corporations. The rally – reminiscent of the Occupy-style rallies that started in 2011 – started outside the FCC’s Washington headquarters at noon with protesters from Fight For the Future, Popular Resistance and others unfurling banners reading “Save the Internet”. Protesters then announced they intend to camp out outside the FCC until 15 May when the regulator is expected to announce new rules for the internet that will formalise plans for higher speed internet for those able to pay for it. On Wednesday Google, Facebook and Amazon joined around 100 other technology companies in signing a letter to the FCC rejecting &quot;individualised bargaining and discrimination&quot; for internet traffic. &quot;[The FCC must] take the necessary steps to ensure that the internet remains an open platform for speech and commerce,&quot; the letter says.  Public interest groups have become increasingly concerned that the new rules will end “net neutrality” – the concept that all internet traffic should be treated equally on the web. FCC chairman Tom Wheeler has defended his plans for what he calls the “open internet”. The future of net neutrality has effectively been in limbo since a federal court struck down most of the FCC’s open internet order in January in a case brought by Verizon. The loss paved the way for fast lanes that have the major broadband providers have lobbied hard for, and for which they plan to charge extra to their biggest users. &quot;We don’t have armies of paid lobbyists at our disposal but we can not let the freedom of the internet be hijacked by giant monopolies,” said Evan Greer of Fight For The Future. More than a million people have now signed petitions to the FCC calling for them to enshrine net neutrality rules and prevent a tiered system. A group of 86 organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Free Press and Reddit, are asking the FCC to reclassify broadband companies as &quot;telecommunication services&quot;, which would give the commission the authority to impose net neutrality rules on them. Wheeler has said the FCC’s new rules will protect net neutrality. “The Internet will remain like it is today, an open pathway,” Wheeler wrote in a FCC blogpost in April. “If a broadband provider (ISP) acts in a manner that keeps users from effectively taking advantage of that pathway then it should be a violation of the Open Internet rules.” Critics charge, however, that cable firms will successfully challenge any new rules to tie their hands unless the FCC’s regulatory control over them is increased and point out cable firms have already effectively created a two-tier system. After the FCC lost to Verizon in January, a tiered system has already started to emerge with Netflix and others striking deals for a faster service with cable firms. “The internet is as necessary to our society as shelter and water, people should have equal access to it,” said Greer. “We have seen an unbelievable amount of support from people since these new rules emerged. It may seem technical but it affects everyone’s life and people are not going to just stand by and let this happen.”",2014-05-07T16:52:38Z,Protesters set up camp at net neutrality rally outside FCC headquarters,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-6639124f-5f5c-4751-91fc-2b3368f45791""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/7/1399480902773/8d7fa35e-c26e-4117-be8d-421a4f8e4124-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Netflix on TV"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A tiered system has already emerged with Netflix and others striking deals for faster service from cable firms.

"America’s top media and telecoms regulator is coming under intense pressure to delay the release of new rules critics say will create a tiered internet controlled by the cable companies. Two members of the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) five-member board have come out for a delay ahead of a scheduled release of new rules on 15 May. Their move comes amid lobbying from some of the US’s largest internet companies against the rules and a widespread and growing online protest. On the FCC’s website, Democrat commissioner Mignon Clyburn wrote that “during the past few weeks, tens of thousands of consumers, companies, entrepreneurs, investors, schools, educators, healthcare providers and others have reached out to ask me to keep the internet free and open”. Clyburn said she would prefer to prohibit pay-for-priority arrangements altogether and would like to see cable companies reclassified so the FCC would have greater regulatory powers over them. In a speech on Wednesday, fellow Democrat commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel also called for a delay following the “torrent of public response” to leaked proposals from the FCC that suggest it is considering enshrining cable firms’ ability to create fast lanes for high-paying customers.  The third Democrat on the five-person commission, chairman Tom Wheeler, has said the new rules will protect the “open internet”. “We need to respect that input and we need time for that input,” said Rosenworcel. “So while I recognise the urgency to move ahead and develop rules with dispatch, I think the greater urgency comes in giving the American public opportunity to speak right now, before we head down this road.” Wheeler, a former top cable and wireless industry lobbyist, has called suggestions that the new rules will create a inaccessible fast lane “flat-out wrong”. He has also said any deals would have to be &quot;commercially reasonable”.  The FCC was forced to draw up new rules after Verizon successfully challenged its power to bar broadband providers from slowing or blocking selected web traffic. Since that January ruling, Comcast has struck a deal with Netflix that will give it access to a faster connection for its service. That deal came after Netflix had accused Comcast of “throttling” its service in order to promote its own video-on-demand offering. The agreement, the terms of which were not disclosed, has sparked fears among consumer groups and Democrats that cable firms will create fast lanes for high-paying, established players that will effectively stifle competition and create a tiered internet. Such a system would effectively end “net neutrality” – the concept that all traffic should be treated equally online. Craig Aaron, president of the lobby group Free Press, said pressure was mounting on the FCC as more people began to see what was at stake in the net neutrality debate. He said it was highly unusual for FCC commissioners to dissent so publicly.  “The cracks are showing,” he said. “It’s very clear that the commissioners are feeling a lot of public pressure. The fact that both Wheeler’s colleagues from his own party are raising serious doubts about his proposal definitely puts things in flux.  “That said, the chairman did put out a statement Wednesday night saying they were moving forward.” Wheeler’s statement came as some 150 of the world’s top tech companies, including Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft, weighed in, calling for the FCC to protect net neutrality.  The tech firms’ move comes as politicians including three Democratic senators – Ron Wyden, Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker – have also called for the FCC to protect net neutrality. In a Facebook post, Wyden called net neutrality “an essential principle to the protection of consumers online”. “When Americans purchase access to the internet,” he wrote, “we purchase access to the entire internet, not just our providers&apos; network. By dividing up the internet into fast and slow lanes – with the fast only accessible by sites who pay the premium, Verizon and Comcast are playing bait and switch with every American consumer.” Internet and civil-rights groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, Free Press and Reddit have collected a million signatures calling on Wheeler to tighten rules protecting the open internet.  On Wednesday, protesters from groups including Fight for the Future, Popular Resistance and others announced they would camp outside the FCC’s offices in protest, ahead of planned 15 May meeting.

"More than 100 technology companies including Google, Facebook, Twitter and Amazon have written to US regulators to warn that proposed net neutrality rules pose a &quot;grave threat to the internet&quot;. The intervention comes against a backdrop of protest at Federal Communications Commission plans that opponents say will create a two-tier internet where big corporations are able to transmit their content to recipients at much higher speed, disadvantaging smaller competitors and other users. The internet companies&apos; letter to the FCC chairman, Tom Wheeler, and the agency&apos;s four commissioners comes amid calls for a delay in a vote on the plan that is scheduled for 15 May. The letter says FCC rules should not permit &quot;individualised bargaining and discrimination,&quot; the companies said.  &quot;[The FCC must] take the necessary steps to ensure that the internet remains an open platform for speech and commerce,&quot; the letter says.  One of the FCC commissioners, Jessica Rosenworcel, has called for a delay of &quot;at least a month&quot; on Wheeler&apos;s plan. &quot;Rushing headlong into a rulemaking next week fails to respect the public response to his (Wheeler&apos;s) proposal,&quot; she said. With two Republican commissioners broadly opposed to regulation of Internet traffic, the support of two Democrats on the panel – Rosenworcel and Mignon Clyburn – is critical. Critics argue the plan, rather than enshrining net neutrality, simply formalise plans for higher speed internet for those able to pay for it. Neil Grace, an FCC spokesman, said Wheeler still intended to put forward his proposals for public comment next week, as planned, as part of a &quot;robust public debate&quot; on the internet. &quot;Moving forward will allow the American people to review and comment on the proposed plan without delay, and bring us one step closer to putting rules on the books to protect consumers and entrepreneurs online,&quot; Grace said.  Tens of thousands of public comments have been received by the FCC on Wheeler&apos;s plan over the past two weeks and commission staff have met with nearly 100 stakeholders including public interest groups and iInternet content providers.  Engine Advocacy and New America&apos;s Open Technology Institute, longtime supporters of &quot;open internet&quot; policies, helped organise the effort.

"The US communications regulator insisted on Thursday that allowing tech companies to pay for a &quot;fast lane&quot; to consumers&apos; homes would not threaten the openness of the internet. The federal communications commission said that it proposed to allow services that take up a large amount of bandwith to pay for preferential treatment. The regulator said that its proposal would include safeguards to protect consumers and to prevent the limiting of competition and free speech. FCC chairman Tom Wheeler insisted in a blog post on Thursday that the new rules will further the principles of an “open internet.” He wrote: “To be very direct, the proposal would establish that behavior harmful to consumers or competition by limiting the openness of the internet will not be permitted,”  Consumer advocates say the proposed system would inevitably allow rich internet giants such as Netflix, Google and Facebook to maintain their edge over startups because they can pay to ensure faster connections and clearer, uninterrupted video. It could result in higher prices for consumers who pay for Netflix and similar online services, as the cost of speedier treatment could be passed on. It also could create a new revenue stream for internet service providers (ISPs) like Comcast or Verizon. Wheeler said three proposals would ensure that consumers were protected: • All ISPs must transparently disclose to their subscribers and users all relevant information as to the policies that govern their network; • No legal content may be blocked; • ISPs may not act in a commercially unreasonable manner to harm the Internet, including favoring the traffic from an affiliated entity. Critics are especially concerned with the “commercially unreasonable” proviso, which some believe could be widely interpreted to benefit ISPs who want to charge services more to give consumers improved access to their content.  Network providers including Verizon and Time Warner have made voluntary pledges to not restrict access to online content, but some feel without a formal rule the companies are not obliged to follow through with the commitment. The proposals are being floated to a small commission on Thursday, before being opened to the agency for a vote to formally propose the rules on 15 May The five-member regulatory commission reviewing the proposal may make changes before the May vote. If the agency makes the rules into a formal proposal, the plan will be open to public comment. The Washington DC circuit court of appeals rejected the FCC’s Open Internet Order in January because it said the agency imposed the rules under the incorrect regulatory framework because it treated ISPs like other telecommunication services, even though they are technically classified as information service providers. The court instructed the FCC to rewrite the rules and it obliged.",2014-04-24T18:54:37Z,FCC asserts new set of net neutrality rules will preserve 'open internet',"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-68432288-e102-45c8-b27a-164ba6df1efd""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/24/1398365324909/3290993c-49f8-4444-8920-7d86de8509ea-460x276.png"" alt=""don't mess with the internet"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Network providers including Verizon and Time Warner have made voluntary pledges to not restrict access to online content, though some are sceptical.

"In January, a federal appeals court rejected regulations designed to assure some measure of fairness in the way America&apos;s internet service providers (ISPs) handle information traveling through their networks. The problem, according to the court, was not so much that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) couldn&apos;t insist on what is called &quot;network neutrality&quot; – the idea that customers, rather than ISPs, should decide priorities for information they get online. No, the issue was that the FCC had tried to impose broadband rules under the wrong regulatory framework. And the court all but invited the FCC to fix its own mistake and rewrite its own updated rules. The FCC&apos;s new chairman, the former cable and wireless industry lobbyist Tom Wheeler, said he would comply, rather than appeal. &quot;Preserving the Internet as an open platform for innovation and expression while providing certainty and predictability in the marketplace is an important responsibility of this agency,&quot; he said in a February statement. Now, based on a slew of frightening news reports last night and a &quot;clarification&quot; from the FCC late this morning, we know how the agency – or at least the former cable and wireless industry lobbyist Tom Wheeler – proposes to respond: it won&apos;t exercise its supreme regulatory authority in the manner the court suggested.  No, not at all.  Rather, the FCC will say – loud and proud – that it is fixing the open-web problem while actually letting it get worse, by providing a so-called &quot;fast lane&quot; for carriers to hike fees on sites trying to reach customers like you and me. Which, inevitably, would mean you and I start paying more to use those sites – if we aren&apos;t already. This is a potentially tragic turning point in American politics and policy. We are on the verge of turning over the internet – the most important communications system ever invented– to telecoms that grew huge through the government granting them monopoly status. Barring a genuine shift in policy or a court stepping in to ensure fair treatment of captive customers – or better yet, genuine competition – companies like Verizon and Comcast will have staggering power to decide what bits of information reach your devices and mine, in what order and at what speed. That is, assuming we&apos;re permitted to get that information at all. Do we want an open internet? Do we want digital innovation and free speech to thrive? If we continue down the regulatory road pursued by the former cable and wireless industry lobbyist Tom Wheeler, all of those good things will be in serious jeopardy. Now, in the interest of fairness, it&apos;s important to quote the former cable and wireless industry lobbyist Tom Wheeler&apos;s reaction to the news leaks, which obviously came from his office. After a brief statement last night, today comes a blog post called &quot;Setting the Record Straight on the FCC’s Open Internet Rules&quot;, in which the former cable and wireless industry lobbyist Tom Wheeler says his new proposal &quot;would establish that behavior harmful to consumers or competition by limiting the openness of the Internet will not be permitted.&quot; The proposed rules, according to the blog post, would require: 1. That all ISPs must transparently disclose to their subscribers and users all relevant information as to the policies that govern their network; 2. That no legal content may be blocked; and 3. That ISPs may not act in a commercially unreasonable manner to harm the internet, including favoring the traffic from an affiliated entity.  It&apos;s unclear why the FCC has the right even to enforce this under the current non-rules, but never mind that. More to the point is what the rules would allow: the oligopoly ISPs, by all reports, would have the right to cut special deals with web companies to give them that fast lane. This is an outright perversion of network neutrality. We pay our ISPs for access to the internet, to get a certain speed – we&apos;re promised &quot;up to&quot; that speed, which is almost never delivered, because the industry&apos;s sleazy but common sleight-of-hand marketing is permitted by the FCC and other regulators. Consider: an ISP like, say, Time Warner Cable, tells, say, Google that its YouTube videos won&apos;t reach us at the, say, &quot;gold package&quot; speed we&apos;ve already paid for ... unless Google, too, pays a gold-standard fee. That is nothing short of a protection racket, run by a company that has little or no competition. In an actually competitive market, an ISP couldn&apos;t conceivably get away with such a thing. Not everything about the proposed rules, as leaked, is awful. Forcing ISPs to be much more transparent about the level of service they actually provide, for example, is highly useful. Getting them to comply honestly, given their record, is another story. If you live in America and believe in an open internet, don&apos;t waste your time sinking into despair over politicians&apos; betrayals. A little anger wouldn&apos;t hurt, but aiming it at the former cable and wireless industry lobbyist Tom Wheeler is pointless. Focus your attention on the people who he works for, and who allegedly work for you. Start with President Obama, whose unequivocal vow as a candidate to support an open internet was as empty as so many of his other promises, if not an outright lie. Don&apos;t stop with Obama, of course. He&apos;s made it absolutely clear which side he&apos;s on (hint: not ours). We all need to ask our legislators – in your communities, in your states, in Washington – whether they want to discourage innovation and free speech by giving control of this essential public utility to a tiny oligopoly. Then:  At the local level, push for community broadband networks, owned and operated by the public. (Waiting for Google Fiber? You might as well wait to win the lottery. Google is not your daddy, or your savior.) The community broadband success stories are already dramatic ... ... so dramatic that the telecom cartel has frantically worked to get state legislatures to prevent them from existing in the first place. Tell your state legislators that this is an unacceptable intrusion on your community&apos;s right to govern itself. Finally, tell your member of the US House of Representatives and your US senators that they have a job to do – to ensure the future of innovation and free speech in a digital world. In particular, tell them that internet access is a public utility and should be treated as such.  There are two ways to prevent abuses by the owners of public utilities. One is to regulate them. Remember that advice from the appeals court? The FCC could re-classify Internet access as a &quot;telecommunications service&quot; (as opposed to the current, largely unregulated &quot;information service&quot;) and require neutral treatment by ISPs. For the moment, this may well be the best choice, but we need to be clear that doing this would not be simple nor without unintended consequences.  Another, better fix is to create genuine competition, or at least the conditions for it. The simplest path forward here would be to require the monopoly/oligopoly ISPs – remember, they got this big in the first palce because they were once granted exclusive rights to &quot;serve&quot; their geographic communities – to share their lines, at a fair price, with competing ISPs. This is what many other countries do, and we should give it a try here.  The best solution? Taxpayers should pay for a fiber-everywhere system, then let competing ISPs use it to compete in a genuine free market. But do not hold your breath on that one. The sky hasn&apos;t fallen with today&apos;s FCC announcements. Let&apos;s not panic. But if we don&apos;t start getting serious about this, as a public, we will lose the most important medium in human history. That would be worse than tragic.",2014-04-24T16:34:37Z,The FCC is about to axe-murder net neutrality.

"Consumer groups reacted angrily Monday to news that Apple is reportedly in talks with cable giant Comcast to launch a streaming-television service that would give Apple special treatment and bypass congestion on the web. The discussions, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, are in early stages, and many hurdles remain. If a deal is struck, it would be the second time this year that Comcast has made special arrangements for a tech company after February’s announcement of a special deal with Netflix, the largest video streaming service. According to the Journal, Apple’s intention is to allow users to stream live and on-demand TV programming using Comcast’s own network rather than the public internet.  The newspaper reported that Apple has asked for a separate “flow” for its traffic. It has not asked for its service to be prioritized over any other service, a situation that would challenge “net neutrality” – the concept that everyone should have open and equal access on the web. But consumer groups charged that Comcast was using a loophole to circumvent the open access rules. Derek Turner, research director at internet rights lobby group Free Press, said: “This is very concerning. This is what happens when you have one major company that is effectively the owner of the internet and a major player in pay TV. This deal and the one with Netflix suggest that Comcast is going to make its own competition pay the quality of service they want for their services.” “The promise of the internet is competition,” he said. “If you are not already a major player, it’s going to be very hard raising money to compete in the pay TV business. And for the major players, their costs are about to rise and will be passed on to their customers.” Michael Weinberg, vice-president of consumer rights group Public Knowledge, said the deal was clearly in its early stages but it still presented a “huge problem for an open internet.” “The idea that a company that wants to launch a service that competes with Comcast needs Comcast’s approval is worrying,” he said. Apple chief executive Tim Cook has long made clear he has grand ambitions for TV. So far the company’s TV efforts have been disappointing, but earlier this year he told shareholders that Apple TV, its set-top box business, had sales of $1bn in 2013 and was no longer a “hobby”. Streaming services using the public internet can suffer over the &quot;last mile&quot; – the portion of a cable network that connects to customers&apos; homes – when too many people access too much bandwidth at the same time. Comcast was ordered to uphold net neutrality until 2018 after its takeover of NBC Universal. The largest cable provider is also in takeover talks with Time Warner, the second largest cable provider, and consumer groups are already up in arms about the likely impact on competition. The Federal Communications Commissions’ (FCC) conditions have an opt out for “managed” services that could allow Comcast to circumvent the net neutrality issue. The US court of appeals threw out an earlier set of net neutrality regulations the FCC had in place in January, ruling that Comcast. Verizon and others were entitled to make deals with Netflix, Amazon and others to pay for faster services. FCC chairman Tom Wheeler has expressed concern that tiered access to the web could mean entrepreneurs are “unfairly prevented from harnessing the full power of the internet.” The regulator is currently drafting new rules aimed at blocking internet service providers from slowing services for content providers that don&apos;t pay a toll.  Turner said the Netflix deal and the emerging terms of any Apple agreement suggested that Comcast had found “very large holes” in the FCC’s net neutrality ruling. He said the FCC should reassess its rules on open internet access in the light of Comcast’s latest moves. “The FCC should be encouraging abundance rather than increased profits through the creation of artificial scarcity, he said.",2014-03-24T16:04:50Z,Apple in talks with Comcast to allow 'special treatment' for streaming-TV,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-6fb6e92c-e2cd-41ba-80f1-fcfb14e2d50e""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/24/1395676739509/86fc4391-95a3-40b5-9086-36a1023b896c-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Comcast"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Comcast in talks to acquire Time Warner Cable for more than $45bn Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",56,Consumer groups reacted angrily to news of deal that would give Apple special treatment and bypass congestion on the web,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/24/1395676739824/20b31cac-6393-4a38-8fd1-15309d4c8ae3-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/24/apple-comcast-streaming-tv-net-neutrality,6,negative
"Today's US appeals court decision on ""net neutrality"" is a major, and deeply worrisome, step in the wrong direction.The promise, and for several decades the reality, of the internet was decentralization: a network of networks where innovation would take place largely at the edges, not in the center. It was the antithesis of the centralized systems of the communications and media systems that prevailed in the 20th Century.We are on the verge of losing the internet that held such promise, at least for the near and medium term. Today's federal appeals court ruling in a suit by Verizon against the Federal Communications Commission's already feeble network neutrality rules is only the latest evidence. The court ruling  (pdf) will embolden America's rapacious telecom companies, which assert the right to decide what bits of information get to internet users' computers in what order and at what speed, or even if they get to our computers at all.This was entirely predictable. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Congress and several presidents have created a policy and regulatory regime almost designed to limit choice in the long run. The FCC's 2010 ""Open Internet Order"", shot down by the court on Tuesday, was just one more bad move in a series of missteps. It purported to regulate the carriers in a way that the FCC had earlier ensured could not be done legally, because the commission had freed the carriers from any commitment to behave as the utilities they have become.The FCC could fix that tomorrow, and thereby slow this rush toward a highly controlled internet. Given the clout of the telecom industry and its well-paid allies, not to mention the timidity, if not culpability, of the policy makers, that's a long shot.The telecoms have repeatedly promised not to do what is in their obvious best interest: turn the internet into an enhanced form of cable television. You are deluded if you think any American corporation, much less these giants that grew up as government-granted monopolies, will operate for the public interest when that conflicts with their bottom lines and political power. I predict that in a few years, Verizon's statement on Tuesday, promising a commitment to customers' internet access ""when, where and how they want"" will be seen as a classic in corporate BS.Besides the carriers, who wins if this decision stands, and if Congress and the FCC don't reverse course? Google will complain bitterly, but it will be one of the winners, because it can afford to be – and, besides, Google already sold out its users on net neutrality in the mobile arena via a deal with Verizon in 2010. Look for deals where telecoms ""partner"" with Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and big media companies of all kinds. If you are a smaller company in media or digital services, you lose. Verizon, Comcast, AT&amp;T and the other carriers will inevitably give higher priority to traffic from companies that pay – a double-dipping process for the carriers – and lower priority, if any at all, to the ones that can't or won't pay. If you are an innovator, you lose, because you will effectively need permission from the central players. Facebook didn't need permission to become a behemoth, but the next innovator in social networking will.Really, though, you and I are the chief losers, because we will pay more and get less than we would have in a more competitive world where we, not the central authorities, make the key decisions about the services and media we want. We won't know what innovation doesn't happen, because it won't be around.The one positive impact of today's ruling, I hope, is that it will reinvigorate a public debate about our online future. And maybe Congress and the FCC will recognize that we need a course correction. It could start by recalling why the internet grew so fast, so amazingly fast, in the 1990s – because when we had to dial up via phones lines, and the phone company couldn't insist on being the only internet service provider, hundreds of ISPs competed for customers. Then Congress and regulators told the cable and phone companies they could squeeze out, or ban entirely, any competition on ""their"" lines.To get the US on a better course, the FCC could classify the telecoms as ""common carriers"" – a designation that would require them to behave neutrally toward the companies that provide information and services, allowing end users to make the decisions. That would be progress, but it's not enough. It could also become onerous regulation that hinders innovation in its own right. Eventually, if America is to have truly state-of-the-art broadband, as a number of other countries have done, we will have to recognize that there's little genuine competition among ISPs today. We'll have to accept that there's a natural monopoly in the deployment of fiber optic lines to homes and businesses (or at least to the curb outside). If we allow single companies to build those lines, we will have to require that those companies allow others to provide internet access itself on the lines – sharing them, in other words. Last week my university hosted a group of journalism teachers from other schools. These professors are planning to help their students appreciate what I call the ""startup culture"", an entrepreneurial environment that rewards ideas and execution in an always-changing technology and media ecosystem. At the end of our five-day workshop, I implored these educators to learn more – and help their students understand – the impact policy has on what they do today, and what they will be able to do tomorrow. In particular, network neutrality is a linchpin to a future in which tomorrow's media ecosystem will emerge.It's all about control, I said. If control reverts to the center of the networks, tomorrow's innovators will need permission, and tomorrow's media users will have fewer choices. Today's ruling is a big step backward for the future innovation America supposedly wants.",2014-01-14T20:58:50Z,"Today's ruling against net neutrality: victory for telecoms, blow for rest of us",,57,<p><strong>Dan Gillmor:</strong> The US appeals court ruling will make it more difficult for normal people and start ups to get the internet access they want</p>,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Columnists/Columnists/2011/11/17/1321543536838/Internet-003.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/14/net-neutrality-appeals-court-ruling-deeply-troubling,4,negative
"Internet providers may be able to offer faster connections to preferred websites, or even block competitors, after a US appeals court ruled that regulators could no longer enforce the principle known as “net neutrality”. In a case seen as having profound implications for the future of digital innovation and free speech, the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in favour of broadband giant Verizon, following a long-running challenge to the Federal Communications Commission’s rule-making powers. FCC regulators had argued that forcing broadband providers to provide equal internet access and bandwidth to all lawful content was a cornerstone of the open internet, and that it encouraged innovation by stimulating a “virtuous circle” that drove infrastructure improvements for all users. But Verizon and other broadband carriers maintain that it hampers their ability to strike commercial deals with content providers, and their ability to provide higher-speed access to premium material, such as high-definition films. The carriers argue deregulation could spur more growth in emerging markets like their own. Regardless of the commercial impact, the decision from a panel of three judges drew immediate concern from free speech groups, who worry about the implications of undermining net neutrality in the US and internationally. “This ruling, if it stands, will adversely affect the daily lives of Americans and fundamentally change the open nature of the internet, where uncensored access to information has been a hallmark of the communication medium since its inception,” Barbara Stripling, the president of the American Library Association, said in a statement. “The court’s decision gives commercial companies the astounding legal authority to block internet traffic, give preferential treatment to certain internet services or applications, and steer users to or away from certain web sites based on their own commercial interests.” The FCC said it would consider an appeal against the decision, which may now go to the full DC appeals court and could eventually wind up with the US supreme court.  “I am committed to maintaining our networks as engines for economic growth, test beds for innovative services and products, and channels for all forms of speech protected by the First Amendment,” said FCC chairman Thomas Wheeler. “We will consider all available options, including those for appeal, to ensure that these networks on which the internet depends continue to provide a free and open platform for innovation and expression, and operate in the interest of all Americans.” The opinion, to which one of the three judges dissented in part, argued that regardless of the merits of net neutrality, the FCC simply did not have the legal power to treat broadband carriers in the way that it does traditional telephone operators. “Our task as a reviewing court is not to assess the wisdom of the Open Internet Order regulations, but rather to determine whether the commission has demonstrated that the regulations fall within the scope of its statutory grant of authority,” the opinion said. “Even though the commission has general authority to regulate in this arena, it may not impose requirements that contravene express statutory mandates.” Verizon welcomed the decision, but insisted it would extend consumer choice in the future rather than limiting existing internet openness. “Today’s decision will not change consumers’ ability to access and use the internet as they do now,&quot; said the company in a statement. &quot;The court’s decision will allow more room for innovation, and consumers will have more choices to determine for themselves how they access and experience the internet.&quot; &quot;Verizon has been and remains committed to the open internet which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content when, where, and how they want,&quot; it added. &quot;This will not change in light of the court’s decision.&quot; Pro-net neutrality activists argue that allowing powerful media companies to strike deals with broadband providers to promote their content over others could also hamper the growth of social media. “The ability of the internet to spread and share ideas is only getting better,” Stripling added in her statement. “With modern technology, individuals and small groups can produce rich audio and video resources that used to be the exclusive domain of large companies. We must work to ensure that these resources are not relegated to second-class delivery on the internet – or else the intellectual freedoms fostered by the internet will be seriously constrained.”",2014-01-14T17:33:38Z,Appeals court rules against FCC's right to protect 'net neutrality',"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-fc-ad25372f-2522-4026-98cc-d468c4501b04""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/21/1385055840960/Verizon-011.jpg"" alt=""Verizon"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Verizon argues that FCC regulations limit their ability to strike commercial deals.

"  6.55pm BST    Closing summary    Today was dominated by political developments from opposite ends of the social spectrum: welfare claimants and lords. The Department for Work and Pensions released its long-awaited statistics on mortality rates among benefit claimants. More than 80 people a month are dying shortly after being declared “fit for work” according to the data, prompting campaigners to call for an overhaul of the government’s controversial welfare regime. The DWP stats revealed 2,380 people died between December 2011 and February 2014 shortly after a work capability assessment (WCA) found they were able to work. Meanwhile, 26 Conservatives were appointed to the House of Lords, including a former MP who claimed expenses to clean his moat, a City banker who has given millions to the party and a chief executive of a company criticised earlier this year for failing to pay the minimum wage. Elsewhere today in the world of UK politics:  The Labour leadership candidate Andy Burnham is charging guests up to £125 a head to attend a Manchester fundraising event, prompting some of his invited supporters to question the cost. Leadership hopfeul Jeremy Corbyn says Labour should take responsibility for resolving “the mess” left behind by private finance initiative (PFI) deals used to fund the building of hospitals under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.  We’re closing the politics live blog now, but we’ve opened a specially constructed blog here to cover the Guardian Live Labour leadership hustings - which you can also watch live here.     Updated at 6.55pm BST     6.47pm BST    BBC: we will aim to protect spending in Scotland, Northan Ireland and Wales    The BBC has responded to Nicola Sturgeon’s proposals for the BBC in Scotland and has pledged to aim to protect spending in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland (which it collectively refers to as the Nations). A BBC spokeswoman said:  Audiences across Scotland get great value from the licence fee, and are some of the highest users of BBC services.   The licence fee funds much loved services across the UK – like BBC One and Radio Two – but also specific services, like Radio Scotland and BBC Alba. Services for smaller audiences clearly cost more to provide, and that is why we spend more in the Nations per head than the rest of the UK – that’s the right thing to do.  We recognise that there is audience demand for greater representation and portrayal of Scottish audiences on all BBC services and we want this to be part of our response in Charter Review.  The BBC’s funding has now been set for the next five years and this will mean cuts across the BBC – we will have to balance our investment on pan-UK services with dedicated services in the Nations.  We will aim to protect spending in the Nations so that content investment is cut less than in other parts of the BBC.  We look forward to working with the Scottish Government on these issues, and to consulting with licence fee payers in Scotland about how they would like to see their licence fee spent.        6.43pm BST    Nicola Sturgeon at Edinburgh international TV festival - verdict    Appearing on stage at the Edinburgh international TV festival, Nicola Sturgeon continued to display the bold and assured attitude she wielded with devastating effect during the general election campaign. Her appearance was only an hour long but the first minister managed to squeeze in enough food for thought to keep us full until parliament returns (which in Scotland is next Monday). Here are the highlights: Who should lead Labour? Not bothered? Sturgeon said she wasn’t tempted to pay £3 and attempt a vote for the Labour leadership. Asked who she was most scared would win, with an air of defiance and unstoppable confidence, she bluntly answered: “I’m not that bothered.” She added this was not meant to be disrespectful to any of the candidates. The first female first minister of Scotland said she was disappointed Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall have added so little to the debate and gave credit to Jeremy Corbyn for enlivening an otherwise uninspiring campaign. Twitter trolls have “nae pals” In a discussion about Twitter abuse from SNP supporters, as well as other politically-affiliated social networkers, Sturgeon revealed her view of these online trolls. “They all sit in their rooms behind their computers in their pyjamas... they have nae pals” she said, prompting laughter from the audience. The media is still too old-fashioned Sturgeon told the audience in Edinburgh that she was proud of what she had done to raise the profile of women in politics but there was more to be done. Attitudes towards women in sport, politics and media are “unacceptable in 2015”, she said. Complaints about referendum coverage were well founded Although her tone appeared to want to draw a line under the debate about the partiality of the BBC’s coverage of the Scottish independence referendum, the first minister made it clear that she believed the broadcaster had a lot to answer for. She accused the BBC of being led by predominantly anti-independence newspapers. She said dismissing protests as intolerance of a free media was the “easy” choice for broadcasters. A federal BBC is what Scotland needs The first minister said she ultimately wants to see responsibility for broadcasting in Scotland transfer from Westminster to the Scottish Parliament, moving to a more federal structure, with separate boards for each of the nations and each of the national boards represented on the UK board. She wants a “distinct BBC Scotland TV channel” to be created. They are bold, radical proposals.       6.18pm BST         &quot;I wd struggle to vote for any&quot; of the main labour leader candidates says Sturgeon #edtvfest&mdash; jane martinson (@janemartinson) August 27, 2015         6.14pm BST       Q: Who would play you in a film about the independence referendum? A: I think Kelly Macdonald is a fantastic actress. Q: Given SNP record on health and education, is control of the BBC wise? Q: I don’t accept the premise. I’m proud of our record on health and education. I don’t rest on laurels.  Q: Will SNP field candidates south of the border? A: Probably not. We should probably stick to Scotland. I made this during the general election campaign. As long as we’re part of Westminster system, I want SNP to work with others. Q: Are you still the most dangerous woman in world? A: I don’t think I ever was. But I’ve said before, it’s by far the nicest thing the Daily Mail has ever said about me.       6.10pm BST       Q: Turning to the Labour leadership. It costs £3 and you get a vote, tempted to join? A: No. I’m enjoying watching. Q: Who would you vote for? A: I’d struggle to vote for any of them. Jeremy Corbyn, give him his due, at least he has got people talking. He’s got people thinking this is something worth taking part in. Give him credit for that. My disappointment is none of the women have seized the moment and shone through. The other three apart from Jeremy Corbyn I can’t think of an issue-led thing they’d said in the campaign. If I was labour supoporter I would be disappointed. Q: Who are you most scared will win? A: I’m not that bothered.       6.08pm BST       Q: SNP supporters have been accused of being quite vocal on Twitter? A: Many people who would tweet abuse in the name of the SNP, aren’t SNP members. But many people across political spectrum tweet abuse. This is unacceptable on all sides. Let’s all of us stop trying to score points and come together and say cyber abuse is completely and utterly unacceptable.  Q: Is it disproportionately targeted at women? A: Yes, not exclusively. But there’s an element to which women get more of it. The kind of person who would tweet abuse, they’ve probably got no pals.       6.05pm BST       Q: Is Scotland a feminist paradise? A: I wouldn’t go that far. I spoke about the media. Political parties still have a long way to go. Yes, we’re going in the right direction. I’m optimistic that we’re not far away from a tipping point.  Q: Let’s turn to the image of the New Statesman cover, which asked: why are so many women childless? (The image of the front page is shown) A: That did infuriate me. The article is perfectly good and reasonable. The New Statesman put the cover out in advance. My objection to that is two-fold. It suggests woman who don’t have children and are successful make cold-hearted about it. Which is rubbish. The imagery is awful. That’s what I’m talkinig about. That would put some young women off politics.       6.03pm BST       Q: You spoke in a nuanced way about the coverage of the independence referendum. Was Alex Salmond over the top in his comments about Nick Robinson? A: Nick has reflected honestly on mistakes he made in his coverage of the referendum. I think Alex would agree with that. Let’s debate properly some of the issues. Learn lessons, agree to disagree in some ways. And do that in a rational way. Q: Alex Salmond says he won’t even watch the BBC? A: There’s an easy way to fix that. They just have to put Forth racing on. Believe me he’ll watch.       6.00pm BST       Q: Can you tell us more about the federated structure you’ve mentioned? A: There’s a great need to make sure network programming better reflects Scottish issues and the life in Scotland. Not just in politics. It’s a way of structurally helping the BBC to reflect the reality of the UK and how the UK is organised. Structural change don’t deliver programme changes. I’m putting forward a principle that Scotland has a fairer crack of the whip. Q: You don’t think you have enough funding? A: No, I don’t. We’re at early stage of charter renewal. I think it’s important we get it right.       5.58pm BST       Q: It has been suggested that £75 million would be needed to fund a BBC Scotland channel. This seems low. What could be done with this level of funding? A: You would get lots of ideas about how with greater resources the production sector here could do great things. What I’m trying to do now at this stage are some principles to guide us. These are set out with intention to strengthen and enhance what the BBC does. None of us can stay stuck as we are.       5.55pm BST       Q: Scottish BBC channel? What would be on it? A: Content that reflects our lives, reflects world affairs from a Scottish perspective. There is demand for more Scottish content. This isn’t Scotland want to be parochial. We want to see ourselves reflected better. We need to make the BBC better.       5.54pm BST       Sturgeon is now taking questions from the audience and the Guardian’s editor-in-chief Katharine Viner. The feed has been dipping in and out so please bear with me if there are any gaps or pauses.    Updated at 6.17pm BST     5.53pm BST       The first minister says she wants a “distinct BBC Scotland TV channel” to be created.  It would help to secure the sustainability of the independent production sector in Scotland, it would see more of the licence fee spent in Scotland, but more importantly, it would by some distance, be the best way of making a wider and richer.        5.52pm BST       Sturgeon puts forward her proposal for the BBC to move to more federal structure, with separate boards for each of the nations and each of the national boards represented on the UK board.  Scotland is an outward looking, internationalist country, intensely interested and active in the world around us - but we also want to see ourselves, our daily experiences and our national story, more fully reflected on our radios and television screens.        5.51pm BST       The first minister says ultimately wants to see responsibility for broadcasting in Scotland should transfer from Westminster to the Scottish Parliament.   To those who say this is about the SNP wanting to exert political control over the BBC, I say that is arrant nonsense. This is not a question of whether a parliament has responsibility for the broadcasting framework - it’s a question of which parliament has that responsibility.        5.50pm BST       Scotland, the BBC and all the nations and regions of the UK have the right to expect something truly radical from the charter review, Sturgeon says.  A BBC that puts forward a bold proposal for Scotland, for the nations and regions, and for the UK will have in us a strong and willing ally. A BBC that offers piecemeal solutions will fail to meet the demands or restore the trust of Scottish audiences.        5.50pm BST       Sturgeon sets out her key principles for charter renewal at the BBC. She says it is important to have a strong and independent BBC and should continue to provide mass-audience programming.   If the BBC does nothing except find niches that aren’t served by commercial broadcasters, it risks losing the widespread popular support on which all of its wider programming rests.  She says funding should be universal. Sturgeon says people who use the iPlayer should pay the licence fee.  The first minister says she is “drawn to the idea” of a progressive, income-based levy, rather than a flat-rate licence fee, adding that a fairer proportion of the licence fee should be invested here in Scotland. The BBC needs to “reflect the nations and regions of the UK much more effectively than it does”, she says.       5.46pm BST       Sturgeon has now turned to BBC charter renewal and its implications for Scotland. First she attacks culture secretary, John Whittingdale, for backing a new licence fee settlement negotiated in secret.  That represents a serious breach of the terms of the UK Government’s memorandum of understanding with Scotland. So too does the UK Government’s decision to appoint an advisory panel without any prior consultation. So a key message from me is that the rest of the renewal process needs to be much more transparent.        5.43pm BST         Media nds to recognise tht some complaints were genuine not misplaced desire to control the media #edtvfest&mdash; jane martinson (@janemartinson) August 27, 2015         5.43pm BST       The first minister alludes to BBC Nick Robinson’s comparisons between protests against his coverage of the Scottish independence referendum to the treatment of the media in Vladimir Putin’s Russia.  The easy thing for broadcasters to do would be to dismiss the complaints and the protests as intolerance of a free media or of opposing opinions. But I think it needs to recognise, as the audience council has done already, that some of those complaints were well founded. The frustration that many felt was not borne out of a misplaced desire to control the media, but from a genuine concern that the playing field didn’t always feel even.        5.41pm BST       Sturgeon is turning to her experience of broadcaster media coverage of the Scottish independence referendum campaign. Her predecessor Alex Salmond has made his views on this clear, and in recent weeks has come to blows with the BBC’s former political editor Nick Robinson over the thorny issue.  That was often compounded by the fact that the daily agenda of broadcasters - and I think the BBC in particular - would often follow what was in the morning papers.  And given that most papers were anti-independence, it would be the reports casting doubt on, for example, the security of pensions that made the splash.  Any reports pointing to the erosion of pensions as a result of Westminster decisions would be buried deep inside. So more often than not the attack on independence led the news coverage.  The sense of overall balance would have been enhanced if news reports had more often been led by critical analysis of the status quo.        5.38pm BST       Sturgeon turns to social media. She says she has sent 11,000 tweets since joining the social network. The first minister says she learned the value of Twitter during the general election when the Telegraph carried a false allegation that she had told the French Ambassador that she wanted David Cameron to win the election.  Before Twitter, it would have taken hours for my rebuttal of that story, which was published late on a Friday night, to appear in print or on TV - and then, of course, it would have been up to the media what prominence it was given. Instead, within minutes of it breaking, people could read a tweet from me saying that it was 100% untrue.  But Sturgeon warns against an “over-reliance” on social media.       5.33pm BST       My colleague Jane Martison is at the Edinburgh international television festival where Nicola Sturgeon is addressing the audience.    Diversity not jst abt women but for minority grps the &quot;pace of change&quot; has been glacial since being described as &quot;hideously white&quot; #edtvfest&mdash; jane martinson (@janemartinson) August 27, 2015         5.31pm BST       Scotland’s first minister says she is angered by the sexist media portrayal of women and the impact it might have on women and young girls who could be driven away from pursuing a career in politics or public life.  Despite the successes of the Lionesses and athletes like Eilidh Child or Jessica Ennis Hill - women in sport receive far less coverage and prominence than their male counterparts. Older female reporters have had to battle to stay on screen whilst their male equivalents hold premium presenting roles well past retirement age. None of that is acceptable in 2015.        5.29pm BST       Discussing diversity, Sturgeon says the media can still feel “old fashioned” particularly in its portrayal of women.  For an industry that prides itself on being creative and innovate, an industry that is driven by new technology and the need to anticipate the changing values and tastes of its audiences, it genuinely surprises me how - dare I say it - old fashioned the media can sometimes feel. The portrayal of women is a case in point.        5.28pm BST       Katharine Viner has introduced the first minister, reminding the audience she was once dubbed the “most dangerous woman in the world” by Piers Morgan. Before getting into her thoughts on the BBC and charter renewal, Sturgeon starts by reflecting on her personal experience with the media.  As result of the global coverage of the referendum, becoming first minister and most recently the general election campaign there has been a dramatic increase in the level of media exposure and scrutiny that I experience.        5.23pm BST       The full story from the Guardian’s Scotland editor Severin Carrell on Nicola Sturgeon’s proposals for new BBC TV and radio channels in Scotland can be read here.  Carrell reveals the proposals are based heavily on an official BBC blueprint which was scrapped after the latest £750m funding cuts. His story comes as Sturgeon joins the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner on stage at the Edinburgh international television festival. She is expected to discuss her thoughts over the future of the BBC in Scotland, as well as her relationship with broadcasters and the press.       5.16pm BST    Sturgeon's BBC proposals based on corporation's own blueprint    My colleague Severin Carrell is about to break a story that reveals Nicola Sturgeon’s ambitious proposals for new BBC TV and radio channels in Scotland are based heavily on an official BBC blueprint which was scrapped after the latest £750m funding cuts. The story comes just as the first minister stands to address the Edinburgh international television festival. He writes:  Sources close to the BBC have confirmed that its executives drew up plans for a new Scotland-only TV channel and an extra radio service funded by the licence fee, as part of the corporation’s proposals for the renewal of its charter. Those proposals, which the BBC forecast would cost about £75m, were leaked to the first minister’s team by BBC staff because they have been shelved after Tony Hall, its director general, was forced by the UK government to accept £750m in cuts under the latest licence fee settlement.        5.02pm BST       Lord Pearson, the former Ukip leader and the leader of Ukip’s three-strong faction in the Lords, has protest about the fact that his party did not get the chance to nominate any peers. In a statement he said:  In 2014, Ukip won the European Elections, with 4.5m voting for us. This year almost 4m voted for us and made us the third largest party by vote share. Instead of recognising this fact Cameron has shown that he has an almost 18th Century attitude to the patronage at his fingertips. Awarding friends, rewarding allies rather than trying to reflect the opinions of his countrymen. Despite increasing electoral support in the country, UKIP has never been awarded a single peerage, a constitutional anomaly that must be ended. It is clear that the prime minister has no interest whatsoever in a fair representation of the people. To that end I am tabling a motion demanding that the situation be debated fully before a single new Lib Dem peer is presented to the House.  That’s all from me, Andrew Sparrow, for today. My colleague Jamie Grearson is taking over now. He will be covering Nicola Sturgeon’s Q&amp;A at the Edinburgh International Television Festival with Katharine Viner, the Guardian’s editor-in-chief. Later I will be launching a separate live blog covering the Guardian’s Labour leadership hustings. There will be a live feed at the top of the blog, so you can watch it too. Do. It should be good.       4.47pm BST       I’ve now had some clarification about the figures I wrote about earlier.  Of the 81,140 who are thought to have died while claiming incapacity benefits, 2,650 had been found fit to work after a work capability assessment. Some 1,360 died after appealing the decision that they were fit to work. I am not clear yet whether that figure is in addition to the 2,650 or includes it.  Andy Burnham and various people on social media have added these two figures together and concluded that “over 4,000” incapacity benefit claimants have died after being found fit to work.  However, I’ve spoken to the DWP and it doesn’t look like these figures can be accurately added together because there is likely to be some overlap between the two. Some of those who appealed their work capability assessment decision will have had it upheld, so been found fit to work, and some will have had it rejected. There is no information provided as to how many fit into the former or the latter category.       4.44pm BST    10 things we learn about how you get a peerage from today's dissolution honours    The House of Lords is a peculiar place. Most of its members are anonymous but reasonably respected lifetime politicos, there is a crop of remarkably distinguished public figures, and there is also some third-rate riff-raff. How do they all get there? Every honours list provides some clues. Here are 10 things we can learn about how you get into the Lords from today’s dissolution honours. 1 - Outstanding parliamentarians have, as always, a more or less automatic pass to the House of Lords. William Hague, the former Conservative foreign secretary, is the obvious example on today’s list, but David Blunkett, the Labour former home secretary, and Alistair Darling, the Labour former chancellor, are two more. Like most honours lists, this one contains some duds, but it also includes respected political figures like David Willetts, Sir George Young, Peter Hain and Tessa Jowell. If there has to be an appointed Lords full of retired MPs, these are the kind of people you would expect to see in it. 2 - Being a member of the PM’s inner circle helps a lot. Greg Barker was a middle-ranking energy minister who in normal circumstances would not expect a seat in the Lords, but he was also one of the very first Tory MPs to back Cameron for leader in 2005, and he finally seems to have had his reward. Kate Fall, Cameron’s deputy chief of staff and a key Number 10 confidante, has been ennobled. And Nick Clegg has used his slice of the dissolution honours to give a peerage to his former chief of staff, Jonny Oates. 3- Women are under-represented at Westminster, but the Lords is being used to make up the numbers. David Cameron has given more than a third of his peerages - 10 out of 25 - to women and almost half of the Lib Dem ones (five out of 11) go to women too. At least one of these could prove controversial. Michelle Mone, the Scottish businesswoman who has become a peer and entrepreneurship tsar, has already come under fire from business figures in Scotland who think she is unsuitable for the post. 4 - Donating helps. Selling peerages is illegal, and there is nothing to suggest wrongdoing on behalf of anyone in today’s list, but an academic study has shown that giving large sums of money to a political party does have a remarkably positive effect on the chances of said donor having their talents recognised in an honours list. Today James Lupton, the Conservative party’s co-treasurer and a “businessman and leading philanthropist” according to the Number 10 citation, has become a Lord. He has given £2.8m to the party. Anthony Ullmann, a businessman and adviser to Nick Clegg who has given almost £100,000 to the Lib Dems, gets a knighthood. My colleague Rajeev Syal has more on this here.  5 - But being a Tory press baron doesn’t. At the election the Conservatives benefited from remarkable positive coverage in papers like the Daily Telegraph. But, if anyone at Telegraph HQ was hoping for some pay-back, it has not arrived today. 6 - Being a longstanding Lib Dem MP is a reliable route in. Proportionately more Lib Dem MPs probably end up in the Lords than Labour or Tory ones, and today’s list contains several Lib Dems who hardly qualify as “distinguished” but how have benefited from the Lib Dem peerage premium. 7 - Failure does not necessarily hold you back. As health secretary Andrew Lansley was responsible for the Health Act, probably the most contentious piece of legislation passed in the last parliament. Even supporters felt that Lansley handled it badly, and he was demoted. But that has not stopped him ending up in the Lords - perhaps because he used to be Cameron’s boss at the Conservative research department. See point 2 above. 8 - But getting caught in a cash-for-access sting does. Jack Straw was entitled to expect elevation to the Lords when he announced he was leaving the Commons before the election, and Sir Malcolm Rifkind, another former foreign secretary, would normally have expected automatic entry too. They were both caught in a cash-for-access sting before the election. Although they both denied doing anything wrong, they weren’t included in today’s list. 9 - The MPs’ expenses scandal won’t necessarily be held against you anymore. Douglas Hogg was vilified in 2009 after it emerged he had claimed expenses partly on the grounds that he needed money for cleaning his moat. Today he becomes a life peer. It will be his second peerage; he already has a hereditary peerage - he is Viscount Hailsham - but that did not allow him to sit in the Lords. 10 - And being rejected by the electorate is not necessarily an obstacle either. The Lib Dem list includes two people going to the Lords after being defeated at the general election, Lorely Burt, Lynne Featherstone, and the Tory list includes Anne McIntosh, who did not even get to fight the election because she was deselected by her local party. All three are women, so point 3 (see above) is coming into play here too.    Updated at 4.50pm BST     3.17pm BST       And here’s Lucy Powell, Labour’s shadow Cabinet Office minister, on the honours list.  David Cameron’s promise to cut the cost of politics lies in tatters. At the election the Tories said they would make the House of Lords smaller, but they have done the opposite, leaving taxpayers with a multi-million pound bill for David Cameron’s new peers.  Time and again the Tories have rewarded those who have given them millions of pounds. At a time when families are struggling to make ends meet, people will see this as the Tories putting their cronies before the country.          3.15pm BST       The SNP, which does not nominate people for peerages because it is opposed to the Lords, has condemned today’s honours list. This is from the statement from Kirsty Blackman MP, its spokesperson on the Lords.  This is a sorry list of rejected and retired party politicians - cronies and hangers-on with big cheque books. The message from David Cameron is – even if people reject your party at the ballot box you will be handed a seat in parliament for the rest of your life – because Mr Cameron ‘can’. It is an affront to democracy that politicians whose parties have been roundly rejected by the electorate can then re-appear in parliament a few weeks later and legislate for the rest of their lives without ever having to be accountable again. That is the scandal of today’s list.        3.04pm BST       Here is a Guardian graphic illustrating the composition of the House of Lords.   Composition of the House of Lords Composition of the House of Lords        2.34pm BST       According to the Constitution Unit at University College London, David Cameron has appointed more peers in five years than Margaret Thatcher did in 11 years. And he is appointing more peers per year than any prime minister since life peerages were introduced in 1958. Here is an excerpt from its briefing note.   David Cameron has appointed to the Lords at a faster rate than any prime minister since life peerages began in 1958. Including today’s figures, Cameron has appointed 44 peers per year, compared to Blair’s 37, Thatcher’s 18 and Major’s 25 per year.     The chamber’s size rose by approximately 50 members in 11 years 1999-2010. In the five years since Cameron became prime minister it has grown by roughly 150 more, including today’s appointments. Once all eligible members are included, the size of the chamber will reach 866 – exactly 200 more than the 666 in 1999.     As of today, Cameron has appointed 236 peers – exceeding the 205 appointed in Margaret Thatcher’s 11 years as prime minister.     As peers can claim a £300 per day attendance allowance, Cameron’s previous appointments have led to increased costs of roughly £30,000 per sitting day (rising to around £43,500 including today’s appointments).       Growth of House of Lords Photograph: Constitution Unit    Some peers do not sit in the House of Lords, but are potentially eligible, because they have taken leave of absence. Professor Meg Russell, the unit’s deputy director, says today’s appointments are unnecessary and that Cameron is damaging the reputation of the Lords.  David Cameron’s excessive appointments to the Lords have already been widely criticised for inflating the size of the chamber, increasing its costs, and at the same time reducing its effectiveness. The Lords has an important role in holding government to account and scrutinising its legislation. Repeated new appointments severely damage its reputation, and increasingly undermine its ability to do its job. No doubt the government would like to be stronger in the Lords, but there is no justification for appointments to rebalance the numbers in the Conservatives’ favour. The Conservative Party is already the largest grouping in the Lords. Since 1999 the Lords has been a ‘no overall control’ chamber, and Labour governed successfully for 9 years from 1997-2006 without being the largest party. This simply required negotiation over policy, which most - even on the Labour side - agree led to better policy outcomes.  She also says that there should be a cap on the size of the Lords pending reform.  Questions remain about large-scale Lords reform, but until that happens (which is unlikely to be soon) the need to sort out the appointments system is now really urgent. Encouraging retirements is not the answer – that could simply allow the prime minister to appoint even more, strengthening his hold over parliament. We need an immediate cap on the size of the chamber, a brake on prime ministerial appointments, and a move to a far more regulated system. The Lords is in danger of serious crisis, and I believe bodies such as the Lords Constitution Committee, or perhaps even the Lord Speaker, now need to step in and help forge agreement for urgent change. The current system is costly to the taxpayer, damaging to parliament, and badly needs to stop.      Updated at 2.39pm BST     2.15pm BST       Jenny Jones, the Green party peer, says today’s honours list underlines the need for Lords reform.  It is disappointing, but sadly unsurprising, that this list is populated by the establishment parties who already dominate the upper house, while the 1.1 million people who voted Green at the general election remain roundly ignored. Almost everyone recognises the desperate need for reform of the House of Lords, as well as our wider political system. Rather than appointing a list of new Lords, David Cameron ought to be working to make parliament fit for a 21st century democracy. The Green party wants to see a House of Lords democratically elected by proportional representation, so that it is representative of and accountable to the public.        2.13pm BST       Tessa Jowell, the Labour former culture secretary who is seeking the party’s nomination to for London mayor, has put out a statement explaining her decision to accept a peerage.  I’m very proud to have been nominated by the Labour Party. I thought long and hard about accepting this honour given my ambition to run London. I’m accepting this, to speak up for London in the House of Lords. Our city is watching on whilst Scotland, Wales and even Manchester are enjoying more and more powers to shape their own destiny.  London must have more powers to tackle the housing crisis, fight the inequality that is dividing our city, and London should also have more freedom to decide how we invest the money we raise in our city and the power to set a higher minimum wage.  Every city should have a champion in the House of Lords, ideally an elected mayor. I want to be London’s champion. I’ll use this position for one purpose and one purpose alone – to fight for Londoners.

David Cameron faces accusations of cronyism after unveiling dozens of new Tory peers, including former ministers and advisers, in the dissolution honours list.  Downing Street announced 26 names proposed by the prime minister, with 11 for the Liberal Democrats and eight for Labour - a total of 45.  They included former foreign secretary William Hague and Mr Cameron’s long-standing gatekeeper Kate Fall, as well as ex-Lib Dem leader Ming Campbell and Labour former chancellor Alistair Darling.  The appointments take the active membership of the upper House to more than 800. Former ministers who served under Cameron featured heavily on the Conservative list, with ex-health secretary Andrew Lansley, Sir George Young, David Willetts and Greg Barker joining Mr Hague in the Lords.  Tory grandee Douglas Hogg, who came under fire during the expenses scandal after it emerged he had filed a claim for cleaning the moat at his country home, is also on the list.  Former Number 10 policy director James O’Shaughnessy is becoming a peer, as is Iain Duncan Smith’s ex-special adviser Philippa Stroud and Tory Party vice-chairman Kate Rock - a close ally of Chancellor George Osborne.  Conservative donor and former vice-treasurer James Lupton has been granted a peerage, as has businesswoman Michelle Mone.  Lib Dem former chief secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander and ex-business secretary Vince Cable get knighthoods, after apparently turning down the chance to go to the upper chamber.  A slew of past and present Tory aides and advisers have also been rewarded for their service with other honours. Oliver Dowden, former Downing Street adviser and now MP, has been awarded a CBE, as have Cameron’s operations chief Liz Sugg and Osborne’s ex-chief of staff Rupert Harrison.  Osborne’s former media adviser Ramesh Chhabra and Hague’s former adviser Denzil Davidson are among those receiving OBEs for “public service”.         1.34pm BST       There are 45 new peers being announced today. Some 26 are Conservative, 11 Lib Dem and eight Labour. This will take the size of the House of Lords over 800. There is a chart showing the current composition (without today’s additions) here, on the House of Lords website.       1.11pm BST    Dissolution honours - Peerages    And here are the peerages.

For public service     Updated at 1.26pm BST     1.01pm BST       As my colleague Frances Perraudin reports, the DWP figures are far from straightfoward. (See 12.01pm.) There is no consensus yet as to what they show. The TUC says they show that that “between 2011 and 2014 over 2,300 people died shortly after losing their claim for Employment Support Allowance and being declared ‘fit for work’”. But Andy Burnham, the Labour leadership candidate, says in the headline to his press notice (see 12.37pm) that “that over 4,000 people have died within six weeks of being assessed as fit to work”. Burnham is assuming that the 2,650 who died after being found fit to work and the 1,360 who died after appealing against being found fit to work are different people. As my colleague Frances Perraudin explained in her analysis, that is not clear from the figures. See 12.01pm.       12.46pm BST       Nick Sutton, editor of the World at One, says he cannot get any minister to come on to his programme today to talk about either immigration or the DWP figures.    We&#39;d like to speak to @ukhomeoffice about today&#39;s immigration figures.

But.. pic.twitter.com/FdXUL5LnqU&mdash; Nick Sutton (@suttonnick) August 27, 2015         12.37pm BST       Andy Burnham, the Labour leadership candidate, says the DWP figures (see 12.01am and 12.24pm) are “shocking”. He has put out this statement.  These are shocking figures that for the first time show the human cost of this government’s punishing benefits regime. It raises serious questions about this government’s punitive approach to people on benefits. We now need an urgent national debate about these figures, and if elected Leader I would call a full-day debate in Parliament at the first available opportunity. This Tory government has been playing politics with the lives of vulnerable people. Under my leadership, Labour will stand for a humane approach to benefits and defend sick and disabled people from these unwarranted and stigmatising attacks.      Andy Burnham Photograph: Russell Cheyne/Reuters         12.24pm BST    More than 2,300 people died after losing claim for ESA, says TUC    In the light of the DWP figures (see 12.01pm), the TUC is calling for an inquiry into the government’s back-to-work regime. It says more than 2,300 people died shortly after losing their claim for employment and support allowance (ESA). This is from the TUC’s general secretary, Frances O’Grady.  We urgently need an enquiry into the government’s back-to-work regime. These disturbing findings cannot be swept under the carpet. The fact that more than 80 people are dying each month shortly after being declared ‘fit for work’ should concern us all. These deaths relate to just one benefit – employment support allowance. We need a welfare system that supports people to find decent jobs not one that causes stress and ill health.     Updated at 12.25pm BST     12.01pm BST    Department for Work and Pensions publishes mortality figures for claimants    The Department for Work and Pensions has released its long-awaited statistics on mortality rates among benefit claimants in a typically opaque form, and the figures don’t immediately appear to give us the information that campaigners have been after – namely the number of people who have died within a year of being found fit to work. The DWP has released two documents, one setting out the mortality rates among all out of work benefit claimants and the other – responding to a series of Freedom of Information requests – giving the number of people claiming incapacity benefits who have died. In the first document, the DWP has tried to argue that their figures show that the mortality rates among benefits claimants have fallen at a similar rate to that of the general population. Though this at first glance appears to be broadly true, the figures show that the mortality rate among those on incapacity benefits has actually fallen at a slower rate than that of the general working age population. Whereas somebody on incapacity benefits (which includes employment and support allowance (ESA), incapacity benefit (IB) or severe disablement allowance (SDA)) was 3.6 times more likely to die than an average member of the general working age population in 2003, they were 4.3 times more likely to die in 2013. The second document is more interesting and the DWP appeared to be trying to burry it by drawing journalists attention to the first. It is a response to a series of Freedom of Information requests that have tried to establish the link between benefit sanctions and deaths. The data does not show the number of people who have died after being found fit for work or after being sanctioned, which is what a number of MPs have been calling for. It does show that 40,680 died between 1 May 2010 and 28 February 2013 within a year of receiving a work capability assessment (WCA) decision. That’s out of a total of 2,017,070 who received WCA decisions during that time and there’s no detail on what the decisions entailed. The document also shows the number of people between 2011 and 2014 whose claims for IB/SDA and ESA have ended as a result of death and the number of those people, in turn, who had also been found fit to work. Of the 81,140 who are thought to have died while claiming incapacity benefits, 2,650 had been found fit to work after a work capability assessment. Some 1,360 died after appealing the decision that they were fit to work. I am not clear yet whether that figure is in addition to the 2,650 or includes it. The DWP has stressed that because data on benefit claimants is only collected every two weeks, they can’t be sure that a person’s incapacity benefit claim ended as a result of their death.    Updated at 12.26pm BST     11.58am BST       Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary and Labour leadership candidate, has put out this statement about the immigration figures.  These figures show David Cameron needs to stop the dishonesty over his failed immigration target and replace it with a sensible plan instead which properly separates immigration and asylum. All his overblown rhetoric has achieved is a decline in public confidence as the electorate are faced with more broken promises. At the same time he has failed to tackle the exploitation by dodgy employers and agencies which is driving low skilled migration, undercutting wages and jobs and at its worst creating modern slavery. Meanwhile universities and businesses are finding the system too rigid to get the top international talent they need. But most troubling of all, the net migration target treats immigration and asylum as the same. That is morally wrong and is preventing Britain playing its part in responding to the terrible refugee crisis that stems from Syria and has spread across Europe. We have a long tradition of providing sanctuary for those fleeing conflict and persecution abroad - yet we are completely failing to live up to that tradition now. Other countries round the world are doing their bit. It is time Britain did too.      Yvette Cooper Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images         11.50am BST       Here’s Humza Yousaf, minister for Europe and international development in the SNP’s Scottish government, on the immigration figures.    Brace yourself for a fresh flurry of anti-immigration rhetoric from UK Govt. Proud to be part of a Scot Govt that doesn&#39;t demonise migrants&mdash; Humza Yousaf (@HumzaYousaf) August 27, 2015         11.47am BST       The Migration Observatory at Oxford University has put out a statement about the immigration figures. This is from its director, Madeleine Sumption,.  Migration levels are currently comparable to what we saw in the mid-2000s after EU enlargement. What this means for the UK is subjective. There is no objective way to decide what the ‘right’ number of migrants is, and reasonable people will disagree. What is clear is that reducing net migration to below 100,000 remains a distant prospect, at least under current economic conditions and policies.  It also points out that another set of ONS figures out today (pdf) show that the foreign-born population reached 8.3m in 2014, or 13% of the population. This is up from 5.3m, or 8.9%, in 2004. The proportion of foreign-born people coming from EU countries is also rising, reaching 37% in 2014, up from 28% in 2004. Sumption added:  The UK remains a major destination for international migrants, in part due to its flexible labour market and attractive higher education sector. But it is by no means an outlier by international standards. People born abroad make up a similar share of the population in other EU countries like Germany, Spain and Sweden.        11.38am BST       My colleague Alan Travis has written a good analysis of the immigration figures. He says politicians should accept that mass immigration makes an important contribution to Britain’s economic growth. Here’s an extract.  The latest official figures showing that net migration to the UK is at record levels underline how far nearly 20 years of continuous mass inward migration has helped turn Britain into a flourishing modern economy. It is not a message that you will hear from many, if any, mainstream politicians but, as the government’s own Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has pointed out, mass migration has been a key factor fuelling Britain’s economic recovery ... Calais may be indicative of the Mediterranean migrant and refugee crisis reaching the shores of Britain, but refugee protection is now only a very small part of the British migration story. But in the face of this widespread evidence that mass migration is now normal for the British economy, Cameron still clings to his ambition of reducing net migration from the hundreds to the tens of thousands, and pretends that deep cuts are compatible with a flourishing modern economy. His next immigration bill, as well as creating a hostile environment for illegal immigrants, will introduce a skills levy on all new migrants to be used to train British labour to fill the gaps in shortage occupations. A worthy cause but hardly facing up to the new reality. It would be better to start tackling some of the social problems, including pressure on public services, that follow such rapid population changes that are also here to stay.        11.32am BST       Lord Green, the chair of Migration Watch UK, says in a statement today’s immigration figures are “appalling”.   The latest figures are appalling. We need to stop and think where this mass immigration is leading. It points to a probable increase of three million in the UK population over the next five years in the face of very strong public opinion. Any further cuts in resources for immigration control would be absurd.  The government are right to focus on the need to ensure departure. Non-EU migrants are arriving at a rate of 300,000 a year but only 100,000 are leaving. It seems that half of those staying on (about 100,000) originally arrived as students. Meanwhile, the nearly 50% increase in net EU migration suggests that simply curtailing benefits is unlikely to be effective.        11.16am BST       The Institute of Directors has criticised the government for having a migration target (getting net migration below 100,000) which it describes as “bizarre and unachievable”. This is from Simon Walker, the IoD’s director general.  There is a sensible and mature debate to be had about the costs and benefits of immigration. At the moment, however, the whole issue is being poisoned by the government’s adherence to their bizarre and unachievable net migration target. By announcing policies on the hoof every time figures are released, the government betrays its lack of a long term plan on migration ... Businesses recognise the public’s concerns over immigration and on the pressure it can place on local communities, schools, housing and public services. The IoD supports British Future’s call for a comprehensive immigration review, based on evidence and expert advice. We want to help set out a sensible plan for managing inward migration in a way which supports our economy, works for our businesses and addresses public concerns. At the moment, however, while everything is clouded under the arbitrary net migration target, that is not possible.        11.06am BST       Here is James Brokenshire, the immigration minister, on the figures.  These stark figures are deeply disappointing. While these figures underline the challenges we need to meet to reduce net migration, they should also act as a further wake-up call for the EU. Current flows of people across Europe are on a scale we haven’t seen since the end of the Second World War. This is not sustainable and risks the future economic development of other EU member states. It reinforces the need for further reform at an EU level as well as within the UK.  Brokenshire said the government has slashed student fraud, struck off nearly 900 bogus colleges and toughened access to welfare and housing.   But with nearly 100,000 non-EU students remaining in the UK at the end of their courses and British business still overly reliant on foreign workers in a number of sectors, there is much more to do. That’s why our new immigration bill will further address illegal working, the pull factors that draw migrants to Britain and the availability of public services which help them to remain here unlawfully. We have asked the migration advisory committee to provide advice on significantly reducing economic migration from outside the EU. We will negotiate with the EU to reform welfare to reduce the financial incentives that attract EU migrants to the UK. And our long term economic plan will see many more young Britons given the training and skills they need to fill the jobs our growing economy is creating.      James Brokenshire Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images         10.43am BST    Immigration - The five key charts that explain what is happening    Here are the five charts that explain the developments in immigration. They are all from the ONS bulletin (pdf).  This chart shows immigration and emigration figures for the last 10 years, and how net migration (the gap between them) has been growing.

And this chart shows the reason from people coming to the UK, and how work-related immigration (now the main type of immigration) has taken off particularly since 2012.     Causes of immigration Photograph: ONS         10.24am BST       Keith Vaz, the Labour chair of the Commons home affairs committee, is calling for a “radically different approach” to immigration. In a statement he said:  These record breaking figures are shocking. Only one month ago Theresa May told the home affairs committee that net migration of under 100,000 was her target.  This is clearly not going to happen. Broken promises on migration do not build confidence with the public. We need a radically different approach.        10.12am BST       And this is from Frank Field, the Labour MP, chair of the Commons work and pensions committee and co-chair of the cross-party group on balanced migration.  These highest ever net migration figures highlight how fundamental it is that the prime minister must secure physical control of our borders as a key red and blue line in his renegotiation exercise with Europe. The failure of all the political parties in not making this a key demand will mean that they will never ever be able to tell the British electorate that they can bring immigration under control, and deliver.        10.10am BST       Here’s Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, on the immigration figures.  These figures reflect Borderless Britain and total impotence of the British government.  If open borders are not part of the Cameron renegotiation then what’s the point of it? Given 192,000 from Romania and Bulgaria registered for national insurance in the year period, how can we believe the ONS figure of 53,000 from the same two countries in the same year?        10.09am BST       The Department for Work and Pensions is not making life easy for us today. They have published two sets of documents about death rates for claimants. I flagged up one 10-page document earlier, mortality statistics for people on disability benefits (pdf).  But that’s not the one they want us to read, because I’ve just had a call saying I should be focusing on the other document, a four-page document covering mortality rates for out-of-work claimants going back 10 years (pdf). That’s what they want us to focus on.  I’ll explain why when I’ve had a chance to read them.       10.05am BST       And this is from Ryan Shorthouse, director of Bright Blue, a thinktank promoting liberal Conservatism, on the immigration figures.  The Conservative government needs to develop a strong record of competence on managing our immigration system. That means new, deliverable targets - such as on non-EU gross migration rather than overall net migration - which the public can hold the government to account on, for example through an annual migration day in parliament. On this day, the migration advisory committee should also publish clear information on the economic and social implications of recent migration.  If a target is not met, and more migrants are here than expected, then the government should have to increase the amount of money in the controlling immigration fund, so local areas are given the necessary resources to cope with higher levels of migration.        9.57am BST       This is from Sunder Katwala, director of British Future, an immigration thinktank.  Having promised a 15-year low for net migration, David Cameron’s instead delivered an all-time high. He’s got to be disappointed with that.  The problem with broken promises is that they destroy public trust. Voters realise that controlling immigration isn’t easy – but they do at least expect the prime minister to have a plan to meet the target he’s set. Unlike the long-term plan for economic recovery on which he was re-elected, his big problem on immigration is that the prime minister has never had a credible plan to meet this target.  These figures have got to be a wake-up call that a new approach is needed. With the Lib Dems out of government, the PM has run out of excuses. Either he sets out a long-term plan to meet the net migration target - or he should set a different target that the government can actually meet.        9.53am BST       The Department for Work and Pensions has published those mortality figures relating to claimants. Here is the 10-page document (pdf). I will post more on it when I and others have been through it.       9.43am BST    Immigration minister James Brokenshire describes rise in immigration as 'deeply disappointing'    The Press Association has just snapped this.  Immigration minister James Brokenshire said new figures showing net migration to Britain is at a record level are “deeply disappointing”.         9.42am BST       Here are more key points from the ONS news release.   Latest employment statistics show estimated employment of EU nationals (excluding British) living in the UK was 250,000 higher in April to June 2015 compared with the same quarter last year and non-EU nationals in employment increased by 7,000. Over the same period, British nationals in employment also increased (by 84,000), therefore three-quarters of the growth in employment over the last year was accounted for by foreign nationals. (These growth figures represent the net change in the number of people in employment, not the proportion of new jobs that have been filled by non-UK workers.)     In YE June 2015, work-related visas granted (main applicants) rose by 8,862 (or 8%) to 121,964, including a 5,177 (11%) increase for skilled work (Tier 2) visas.     Long-term immigration for study increased from 176,000 to 188,000 in YE March 2015 (not statistically significant). Over the same period, visa applications to study at a UK university (main applicants) rose to 166,481.     There were 25,771 asylum applications (main applicants) in YE June 2015, an increase of 10% compared with the previous 12 months (23,515). The number of applications remains low relative to the peak number of applications in 2002 (84,132).     The largest number of applications for asylum came from nationals of Eritrea (3,568), followed by Pakistan (2,302) and Syria (2,204). A total of 11,600 people were granted asylum or an alternative form of protection.           9.35am BST       Here is the 38-page ONS statistical report with the full details (pdf).       9.34am BST       Here are the key points from the Office for National Statistics news release.  Main points for year ending March 2015:  Net long-term international migration = +330,000 (up 94,000 from YE [year end] March 2014)  Immigration = 636,000 (up 84,000)   Emigration = 307,000 (down 9,000)  • The net migration figure was a statistically significant increase from 236,000 in YE March 2014 and is the highest net migration on record.  • Net migration of EU citizens showed a statistically significant increase to 183,000 (up 53,000 from YE March 2014). The increase in non-EU net migration to 196,000 (up 39,000) was also statistically significant and is a result of an increase in immigration (not statistically significant) and a decrease in emigration (statistically significant).  • The increase in long-term international immigration included a statistically significant increase for EU citizens to 269,000 (up 56,000), the highest recorded level for this group; and an increase for non-EU nationals to 284,000 (up 23,000) (not statistically significant).  • 53,000 Romanian and Bulgarian (EU2) citizens immigrated to the UK in YE March 2015, a statistically significant increase and almost double the 28,000 in the previous 12 months.  • 290,000 people immigrated for work in YE March 2015, a statistically significant increase of 65,000 from 225,000 in YE March 2014 continuing the upward trend. • There were statistically significant increases of immigration for work for both EU citizens (from 134,000 to 162,000 in YE March 2015) and non-EU citizens (from 48,000 to 64,000). The increase for British citizens was not statistically significant. Of the 53,000 EU2 citizens immigrating to the UK, 42,000 were coming for work, a statistically significant increase of 20,000.  • 61% of EU citizens immigrating for work had a definite job to go to, whereas 39% were intending to look for a job rather than taking up an offer of employment.      Updated at 9.34am BST     9.31am BST    Annual net migration hits record high at 330,000    The figures are out.    Annual net migration to Britain hits record 330,000 - 10,000 higher than previous 2005 peak of 320,000 - ONS&mdash; Alan Travis (@alantravis40) August 27, 2015      Updated at 11.20am BST     8.55am BST       It’s “take out the trash day” at Westminster. After a summer that has seen the government’s communications machine largely comatose (understandably - why would they want to make news when Labour is imploding), today we’re getting three potentially “bad news” stories from the government all at once: immigration figures, DWP figures about claimants who have died after losing their benefit, and the dissolution honours list. Ministers have been accused of “burying bad news”. Just for good measure, we’ve also got two Labour leadership hustings. My colleague Alan Travis has written a preview story about the immigration figures. Here’s how it starts.  New official figures are expected to show that net migration to Britain has reached record or near record levels. The politically sensitive figure, which estimates the net flow of people in and out of Britain, stood at 318,000 in the last set of quarterly figures published in May just after the general election.  This was just 2,000 below the 320,000 record high in net migration recorded in 2005, soon after Poland and other east European states joined the EU. The net migration figure is politically significant since David Cameron renewed the Conservatives pledge to reduce it to the “tens of thousands” immediately after the general election. The latest quarterly migration figures, covering the 12 months to March 2015, published on Thursday are expected to show that the number of foreign-born people living in Britain has passed the eight million mark for the first time and that more than three million of them have become British citizens since arriving in the UK.  I will be covering the figures, and the other announcements, in detial. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Immigration figures are released. 9.30am: The Department for Work and Pensions publishes figures showing the number of claimants who have died after losing their benefits. Late morning: The dissolution honours list is expected to be published. 1.30pm: The Daily Mirror holds a Labour leadership hustings. 5.15pm: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, speaks at the Edinburgh International Television Festival. She is doing a Q&amp;A with the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner. 7pm: The Guardian hosts a Labour leadership hustings. I will be covering that in detail on a separate live blog.

"Annual net migration to Britain has hit a record level of 330,000 – 10,000 higher than its previous high in 2005, according to the Office for National Statistics. The 94,000 rise in overall net migration in the 12 months to March was fuelled by a rise of 84,000 in immigration to 636,000 and a fall of 9,000 in emigration, according to the latest quarterly figures. The rise is split between a 56,000 increase in the numbers coming to live in Britain from within the European Union and a 39,000 rise in those from outside the EU.    Related: Migration figures: what do the numbers really mean?    The latest rise in net migration has been mainly driven by a continuing rise in those coming to work in Britain, who account for 65,000 of the increase. Nearly two-thirds of those already had a job to come to. There has been a near doubling in the number of Romanians and Bulgarians coming to Britain, from 28,000 to 53,000 in the last 12 months. The 330,000 record high in net migration is 10,000 higher than the previous peak of 320,000 recorded in 2005, soon after Poland and other east European states joined the EU. The net migration figure is politically significant, since David Cameron renewed the Conservatives’ pledge to reduce it to the “tens of thousands” immediately after the general election. The figures, covering the 12 months to March 2015, also show that the number of foreign-born people living in Britain has passed the eight million mark for the first time and that more than three million of them have become British citizens since arriving in the UK.   Related: Germany gets 27 Syrian asylum applications for every one to the UK    The immigration minister, James Brokenshire, said the figures showing net migration 220,000 higher than the government’s 100,000 target – and rising – were “deeply disappointing”.           James Brokenshire says EU migration is knocking the UK off course of its targets. Link to video    He said: “We have slashed student fraud, struck off nearly 900 bogus colleges, and toughened access to welfare and housing. But with nearly 100,000 non-EU students remaining in the UK at the end of their courses and British business still overly reliant on foreign workers in a number of sectors, there is much more to do.” The minister said the government had asked for official advice on reducing economic migration from outside the EU as well as negotiating labour market and welfare reforms within Europe. But the business organisation London First warned the government not to use the record figure as an excuse to limit the sort of positive immigration that grows the economy.   Immigration numbers   “Our world-beating industries need access to talent and skills from around the world in order to remain global leaders,” said Mark Hilton, London First’s immigration policy director. “But they are struggling to bring in the talent we lack because they’re hitting government limits for skilled workers. “We need to make strategic decisions on immigration, not knee-jerk ones that fail to take account of the needs of the economy.” The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said the figures showed that Cameron needed to replace his failed immigration target with a sensible plan that properly separated immigration and asylum. “The net migration target treats immigration and asylum as the same. That is morally wrong and is preventing Britain playing its part in responding to the terrible refugee crisis that stems from Syria and has spread across Europe. We have a long tradition of providing sanctuary for those fleeing conflict and persecution abroad, yet we are completely failing to live up to that tradition now. Other countries around the world are doing their bit. It is time Britain did too,” she said. The detailed ONS figures show that the Mediterranean refugee crisis is not driving the surge in migration to Britain. There were 25,771 new asylum seekers in the 12 months to June – a 10% rise on the previous year but far below the 84,000 peak seen in 2002. The largest number of asylum seekers came from Eritrea (3,568), Pakistan (2,302) and Syria (2,204). Amnesty International voiced alarm over a sharp rise from 14% to 66% in the refusal rate of asylum applications by Eritreans between April and June this year. It said it feared the Home Office was relying on research from the Danish immigration service that played down human rights violations in Eritrea despite thousands of people being held as political prisoners and widespread use of torture in prisons. The flow of asylum seekers is only a minor factor in the growth of migration to Britain. More than 290,000 of the record 636,000 new migrants in the year to March came to work, continuing a long-term upward trend.  The ONS say that 61% of all EU new migrants arriving had a definite job to go to, undermining claims that “benefit tourism” is the key factor. Figures for new national insurance registrations indicate that the top nationalities of new migrants for work are Romania, Poland, Italy, Spain, Bulgaria, India and China. Labour market figures show that foreign nationals accounted for 75% of the growth of 342,000 in employment in Britain in the 12 months to June, reversing a previous trend for stronger growth in employment of British workers. The number of overseas students coming to Britain increased by 8,000 to 188,000, with the largest numbers coming from China and India. Home Office visa figures show Chinese students now account for one-third of the total. The number of Bangladeshi students is down by 1,671, a fall of more than 50%, and Indian student numbers are also down, by 1,251 or 10%. The number of enforced removals of illegal migrants has changed little over the past year at 12,609, but the number of people locked up in immigration removal centres has risen by 11% to 3,418 detained in June. A total of 216 people have been detained for longer than a year for immigration reasons. The impact of the Calais migrant crisis has driven immigration to the top of voters’ concerns, according to an Ipsos Mori poll this month, with more than 50% of voters naming it as a major issue facing the country. This was an eight-point jump compared with the June poll in the same series.

"Natalie Massenet, the founder of Net-a-Porter, has quit the online fashion empire she created just weeks before its takeover by an Italian discounter is finalised. The former Tatler journalist, who launched the company selling designer clothes from her Chelsea flat, leaves with more than £100m cash after selling her stake in the company, according to Bloomberg.  Yoox, an Italian online retailer, agreed to buy Net-a-Porter from its current owners Richemont, the luxury fashion group, in March. The deal, which has just been cleared by European competition regulators, creates a global fashion giant with sales of more than €1.3bn. Yoox said in a statement: “Following Natalie Massenet’s tendering of her resignation as executive chairman of the Net-a-Porter Group, Ms Massenet will not be a member of the board of directors of the new group, which will result from the upcoming merger.”  Massenet was due to be the merged company’s executive chairman with Federico Marchetti, Yoox’s founder, as chief executive. Fashion insiders said Massenet, who only last month said she was planning to stay on at Net-a-Porter after the merger, was unhappy at the prospect of playing second fiddle to Marchetti. Analysts said her role amounted to being a “group ambassador” with few direct responsibilities. She said: “As for my own future, my entrepreneurial drive is as strong today asit always has been, and my passion for innovation will continue to be my greatest guide in business.” Now chair of the British Fashion Council, Massenet started her career at US fashion trade journal Women’s Wear Daily before moving on to Tatler, where she worked with celebrated fashionista Isabella Blow. She left in 1998 to go freelance before launching Net-a-Porter in 2000 with the backing of her then husband.  Exploiting the emerging internet shopping trend, Net-a-Porter expanded to include French, German and Chinese versions of its site and now delivers its merchandise, wrapped in fine tissue paper, beautifully boxed and tied up in ribbon, in 170 countries.

"Go to your local benefits office and desperation can be boiled down to a six-point plan, mounted on pink laminated card. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has assembled written guidance on suicide for its “frontline staff” – a euphemism for workers hired to call people and break it to them that they’ve been rejected for benefits. One section of the guidance – that is to be reported to managers to alert them of “a suicidal intention” – instructs jobcentre staff to find out what the person plans, when it is planned for, and whether “the customer has the means to hand”. I don’t know at what point social security and a risk of suicide became inevitable partners. Or when government “supporting people” – as the DWP described the guidance this week – began to mean, not helping people build their lives, but checking that they do not want to die. Death has become a part of Britain’s benefits system. That is not hyperbole but the reality that the stress caused by austerity has led us to. Shredding the safety net – a mix of sanctions, defective “fit for work” tests, and outright cuts to multiple services – has meant that benefit claimants are dying; through suicide, starvation, and even being crushed by a refuse lorry when a 17-week benefit sanction forced a man to scavenge in a bin for food.    How can a government have such disregard for death? It is worth looking at how it expects some of us to live    This morning, the government released mortality statistics – or rather, was forced to after several freedom of information requests – that show more than 80 people a month are dying after being declared “fit for work”. These are complex figures but early analysis points to two notable facts. First that 2,380 people died between December 2011 and February 2014 shortly after being judged “fit for work” and rejected for the sickness and disability benefit, Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). We also now know that 7,200 claimants died after being awarded ESA and being placed in the work-related activity group – by definition, people whom the government had judged were able to “prepare” to get back to work. Notably how or why each of these people died was not recorded – meaning it’s impossible to say whether a death was linked to an incorrect assessment. But for the government, distortion is key and it is not restricted to faked benefit sanction leaflets. If we needed a sign of the DWP’s intentions, as it prepared to release today’s mortality statistics it was seemingly hedging its bets by finalising the details for a tribunal where it had planned to try to repress some of them.   Related: Thousands have died after being found fit for work, DWP figures show    How can a government have such disregard for death? It is worth looking at how it expects some of us to live. Until a few months ago in Bootle, Merseyside, a 48-year-old severely disabled man was being washed in a paddling pool in his front room. Rob Tomlinson, who has cerebral palsy, had used a purpose-built walk-in shower in the specially converted four-bed council house he shared with his carers, his brother and sister-in law. The bedroom tax saw the family evicted and until a new property was found a year later, Rob lived with only a child’s pool and hose to stay clean. There is a reason, in the age of austerity, that politicians and much of the media has stopped using the term social security and replaced it with “welfare”. It sets expectations much lower. A sense of security for members of society in need bumped down to mere subsistence. Today’s mortality statistics do not simply point to the death of disabled, poor, and ill people but of the system that was meant to protect them. Before our eyes the principle of a benefit system is being reduced from opportunity, respect, and solidarity to destitution, degradation and isolation. Six-point plans to avoid people on benefits killing themselves do not exist in a society that has hope for their lives. The welfare state was built on the idea of “the cradle to the grave”. Now for thousands, all they receive is help to that grave.",2015-08-27T15:57:49Z,Death has become a part of Britain’s benefits system,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""f7915636c745891507bb2083c1778691e9d3ff13""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/f7915636c745891507bb2083c1778691e9d3ff13/0_129_4256_2553/1000.jpg"" alt=""Protesters at the Department for Work and Pensions, London, 2 March 2015."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Protesters at the Department for Work and Pensions.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Peter Marshall/Demotix/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>",62,More than 80 people a month are now dying after being declared ‘fit for work’.

"All that will ever be told about Prince Charles’s correspondence with ministers is now known. This afternoon the second and final batch of letters between the heir to the throne and senior politicians was released. Presumably that correspondence continues, but the Freedom of Information Act has now been amended expressly to exclude royal communication. It is no longer possible to find out what cause he is so politely advancing or what pressure he is so courteously exerting on the upper reaches of government. It is appealing to suppose that, because no shocking revelations have emerged, it does not matter that the future king cares deeply about, say, affordable rural housing or the integration of complementary with conventional medicine in the NHS. Ministers do not complain about the way the prince invades their space and takes up their time to promote his own occasionally eccentric beliefs, or presses the case for influence in official business for his charities, although there have been occasional leaks. But he would be dangerously mistaken to suppose that because the publication of his letters has in general provoked nothing more than an indulgently raised eyebrow, he can be an activist king without imperilling the monarchy itself. Like the first batch released three weeks ago, this second tranche of 17 letters and replies between Clarence House or Highgrove and four departments – health, culture, communities and international development – between 2007 and 2009, displays a deeply conservative interest in matters such as historic buildings, drawing and organic food. They are not overtly self-interested, although they are sometimes a little peevish. He may not be the only motorist to be irritated to see a toxic weed flourishing beside the M25, but he will surely be the only one to have had an exchange of letters about it with a cabinet minister. The Guardian’s long fight for the letters culminated in a ruling from the supreme court in March backing the original decision in favour of publication. By its ruling that the attorney general, as the executive, did not have the power to review the findings of the courts, freedom of information and the principle of separation of powers is strengthened. That alone would justify the fight. But that was not why the government spent £400,000 trying to keep the letters secret. It wanted to protect the monarchy from publication of material that – as the then attorney general, Dominic Grieve, argued – would be seriously damaging to Prince Charles’s future role. Clarence House tried too, carefully identifying the people who had first raised the concerns the prince advanced. Recognising the fragility of the political neutrality that is the cornerstone of the modern monarchy, they wanted to argue that he was not simply acting on personal whim. It may never be greatly significant that the future king holds traditionalist views of the kind that the amiable Wodehousian character Lord Emsworth might have shared. It certainly is no surprise.

"Coming three months after a general election in which an avowed anti-migrant party won 3.8m votes, there was inevitably going to be a debate about employment figures showing that EU nationals accounted for about 55% of the net jobs growth in Britain over the past year. The figures for the three months to June will add fuel to Ukip’s fire. They show the weakening labour market has hit UK-born workers hardest. The number of them employed fell by 170,000. By contrast, the employment of people born abroad but within the EU rose by 85,000, and other foreign workers by 30,000. The impact of migrant workers on salaries is another burning issue. Annual wage growth at this point in the recovery should be between 4% and 4.5%, but the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said it was stuck at 2.8% during the last quarter. Could the influx of EU nationals, from a population of about 750,000 in 2006 to 2 million today, be limiting everyone’s pay bargaining power? Let’s take the employment issue first. The ONS produces figures for a net loss or gain. So if the figures for migration tally with those for a net increase in jobs, one might surmise that migrants are taking all the new jobs. But the figure for net jobs is not the same as new jobs, which is generally a far larger number.   Related: Rise in UK unemployment fuels labour market jitters    In an economy as large and sophisticated as the UK’s, there is always a huge number of jobs being destroyed and created during any given period. The ONS figures for net employment tell us the total loss or gain from this process, not who is getting the new jobs being offered by employers.  And even if many of the new jobs are going to Spanish engineers, Polish construction workers and Greek waiters, those UK nationals who are out of work should blame decades of under-investment that has led to them being hemmed in by a lack of aspiration on one side and a lack of education and training opportunities on the other. Looking back over the past year, a breakdown of the figures shows there has been an 85,000 reduction in the number of self-employed people. The number of women in part-time work has also declined. Some of these may have gone on the unemployment register, others will have switched to full-time employment. Only a more in-depth study can tell us what has happened. What about the impact on wages? It is not hard to find anecdotal evidence of foreign workers accepting a professional job on a salary that a British national would only agree to take with a gun at their back, having slogged for five or seven years to qualify for it. Low-skilled workers often make the same complaint. But research by the labour market economist David Blanchflower shows only a marginal effect on wages at the bottom of the income scale. On the other hand, immigration will have many positive effects in keeping struggling businesses from going bankrupt or helping thriving ones win new contracts, as much as it has depressed wages in some parts of the economy. As John Philpott, the director of JobsEconomist, has argued, there are many reasons for slow wage growth compared to previous recoveries. He cites the collapse of trade union power, a reduction in workers’ rights, the tougher welfare regime and low inflation, which allows employers to keep wage rises to a minimum and delay investments that raise productivity. All these are domestic issues that put workers in a much weaker position than they faced during the recovery of the early 1990s.

"I am normally woken very early as I have young children, so I use the bright start to kick-off my working day with a cup of tea and catch-up with overnight activity from our national network of psychotherapists, who provide online cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) sessions. As clinical lead of Ieso Digital Health I need to check our online sessions have been running smoothly, as some of my team hold late evening consultations to suit patient’s schedules. Most days I arrive at the office earlier than my colleagues to work on writing reports or developing training while the office is quiet. I then head into a team meeting, in which we discuss priorities and our expansion plans aimed at taking talking therapies online into new areas. I’ll then meet with my in-house team of psychotherapists who help me line-manage our network of CBT therapists around the country.  I’m passionate about widening access to evidence based psychotherapies. Throughout my 25 years as a clinician and university lecturer I’ve worked hard to look at innovative ways we can provide mental health treatment and reduce suffering. I am also a strong advocate of the role technology can play to widen access to mental health services, and the role it plays in enhancing learning. We hear a lot about how the rise of technology use, such as smartphones, is harming our mental health, but I believe the same technology can be a real safety net too. We predominantly provide cognitive behavioural therapy online using written communication. The therapist and patient work together collaboratively in a secure portal therapy room. Appointments are held in real-time and are very structured to ensure the patient can work towards their therapy goals. Our therapists are all accredited by the British Association of Cognitive and Behavioural Psychotherapies (BABCP). They can treat anywhere between one to 10 patients at any time, with each session lasting around an hour. Patients are then given homework or lessons to complete during the week before their next session. If patients have questions or need some added support between consultations, the therapist is available at the touch of a button. Therefore, a key part of my role is to make sure that each therapist’s workload is manageable. The other major part of my role is to ensure quality of consultations, which is much easier to do in an online environment as I can see copies of all the written consultations, unlike face-to-face therapy which takes place behind closed doors and is therefore much more difficult to monitor.  Each lunchtime the whole office comes together to eat – we all love food and each bring a dish in most days to share. It’s a friendly and nurturing environment to work in so it’s nice to take some time to get to know each other. We have started holding mindfulness meditation sessions during the break and, as our office is based in the countryside, we’ll go for a mindful stroll after lunch before returning to our desks. I often travel to meetings around the UK in the afternoons with people such as GPs, therapists or clinical commissioning group (CCG) managers who are interested in learning how our model can be integrated with their services. Our service is already available across 26 NHS CCGs and this number is continuing to expand, so part of my job is to spread the word and discuss our research which shows how effective our treatment can be for treating mild to severe mental health issues at a fraction of the cost of traditional therapy services. After the school run towards the end of the day I’ll often continue working, supervising some of the evening sessions of our therapists over the internet from home. I’m on call during the evening as well so I may speak with therapists who are having problem patients, or may speak to patients who are distressed. What really makes my day is receiving great feedback from patients who feel they have really benefitted from our service. Recently, one of our patients wrote to say they had just completed their fifth session with us after plucking up the courage to converse with one of our therapists online. They’d previously been too nervous about speaking to someone in person to seek treatment. It’s comments like these that really make me feel focused on my mission to expand mental health access more widely using technology.  Join our network to read more pieces like this.

"In the US, more than 1 million citizens have petitioned congress to protect something which, they claim, is a cornerstone of democracy: net neutrality. In a select few other countries grassroots sentiment is endorsed by politicians, with Chile having the honour of being the first country to legislate, in summer 2010, to guarantee net neutrality. Belgium and the Netherlands have done likewise; others are likely to follow suit. What, then, is net neutrality, and to what extent is it a controversial issue in Britain? Alex Capes, digital director of creative agency the Church of London, argues that ""net neutrality is integral to the operation of the internet as we know it. It's essential to us as a medium-sized, independent business because it ensures that there's an online level playing field."" Capes's view is commonly held and arises from the conventional definition of net neutrality, namely that it is a principle which holds that internet service providers (ISPs) should treat all online traffic equally, regardless of the kind of content they're carrying or its origin. Campaigners say ISPs must not be allowed to decide that some content providers are more equal than others. This, though, is exactly what has been happening in the US – hence the ire of more than a million Americans. There, giant telecoms corporations such as A&amp;T, Comcast and Time Warner want to charge content providers to guarantee the speedy delivery of their data. They also want to slow down or even block competitors' services, while discriminating in favour of their own search engines, internet phone services and streaming video. In effect, they want a fast lane for their, and their partners' use – and a slow lane for everyone else. As Patrick Clark, a telecoms expert with city law firm Taylor Wessing, puts it: ""In the US, the major content providers and ISPs want to conclude agreements to guarantee the preferential carriage of content. The situation is a bit like the BBC reaching agreement with BT for guaranteed top-quality provision of its iPlayer service.""Tim Berners-Lee, the man credited with inventing the world wide web, has spoken out in favour of net neutrality, saying: ""The Internet thrives on lack of regulation. But some basic values have to be preserved. For example, the market system depends on the rule that you can't photocopy money. Democracy depends on freedom of speech. Freedom of connection, with any application, to any party, is the fundamental social basis of the internet and, now, the society based on it."" In contrast, Bob Kahn, one of the internet's founding fathers, has declared his opposition to the idea of legislation, saying that it would ""freeze innovation in the core of the internet"". But if controversy stalks net neutrality in the US, what is the regulatory stance towards it in Britain and Europe? Clark explains that ""earlier this year, the European Commission confirmed that it remains committed to ensuring 'the maintenance of a robust best-efforts internet to which everyone has access'.  However, it also recognised that 'traffic management' of some kind would be 'necessary to ensure the smooth flow of internet traffic, particularly at times when networks become congested'. It also highlighted rules on transparency, switching and quality of service, commenting that these form part of the revised EU electronic communications framework adopted in 2009 [but still being implemented in Member States].""In practice, explains Clark, what this means is a ""wait and see"" approach, albeit that ""another report is due at the end of the year from a combined European regulators group, the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC). It may result in a reappraisal of this position."" In the UK, meanwhile, Clark says that ""Ofcom and the UK government went through a similar process in 2010. The result is also the adoption of a watching brief, on the basis that the market must decide what's best.""But should we care? Is net neutrality really a cornerstone of modern democracy, as its advocates contend? Or is all this just a big business scrap, of little real import to the consumer? For Capes, net neutrality is vital. ""It ensures that the internet remains a free and open technology. Allowing ISPs and content providers to demand a toll will create an unfair business model."" Capes believes that if legislation is required to preserve net neutrality then so be it, but Clark is not convinced. ""One day, access to broadband might be seen as an inalienable human right, but we're not at that stage yet. The internet and its surrounding markets are still evolving. Pure 'net neutrality' implies infinite capacity in the networks, but that is not the case today, and huge investment is required by network owners to ensure that the internet can cater for future needs. It would seem sensible to monitor developments and legislate if needs be, rather than try to mandate something which may well survive of its own accord.""",2011-10-03T14:50:36Z,"Net neutrality: online, we're all equal – but for how much longer?",,67,<p>Net neutrality is the guiding principle that preserves a free and open internet – but it's under attack</p>,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/commercial/2011/9/30/1317390043136/Network-Operation-Center--003.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/media-tech-law/net-neutrality-business-democracy-usa,4,neutral
"The largest US mobile phone company has began legal action against new government regulations that protect the free flow of internet traffic in the latest twist on the ""net neutrality"" debate.Verizon Communications is taking the action following the publication last week of new Federal Communications Commission rules barring fixed-line broadband companies from prioritising or blocking any legal content on their networks.Some companies would like to charge content producers in exchange for delivering their material, such as movies, to consumers faster than other non-paying internet traffic.The rules, which come into effect in two months, are more lenient on mobile networks. Phone companies are only barred from blocking voice and other applications that compete with their own services, but are allowed to manage all other traffic so that their systems are not overwhelmed.Nonetheless, Verizon is challenging the FCC's right to set rules on net neutrality. ""We are deeply concerned by the FCC's assertion of broad authority to impose potentially sweeping and unneeded regulations on broadband networks and services and on the internet itself,"" said Michael Glover, Verizon's general counsel.""We believe this assertion of authority is inconsistent with the statute and will create uncertainty for the communications industry, innovators, investors and consumers.""The challenge was expected. Following approval of the FCC's open internet regulations in December, Verizon filed a similar suit earlier this year, which was thrown out after the court determined the complaint was premature. Publication of the rules on 23 September in the Federal Register gave Verizon its opportunity to mount a fresh challenge.The rules are illegal because they would modify Verizon's existing spectrum licenses without its approval, the company said in a notice of appeal filed on Friday at the US district court of appeals in Columbia.Those arguing for an open internet say the FCC rules do not go far enough, giving mobile carriers too much freedom to throttle traffic. Media reform group Free Press filed a suit in a Boston appeals court on Wednesday arguing the regulations were too weak.""When the FCC first proposed the open internet rules, they came with the understanding that there is only one internet, no matter how people choose to reach it,"" said Free Press policy director Matt Wood.""The final rules provide some basic protections for consumers, but do not deliver on the promise to preserve openness for mobile internet access. They fail to protect wireless users from discrimination, and they let mobile providers block innovative applications with impunity.""",2011-10-01T13:54:04Z,Mobile phone giant challenges new US regulations on internet neutrality,,68,<p>US mobile company files lawsuit over Federal Communications Commission's right to rule on flow of internet traffic.

"Donald Trump has very clear views as to his net worth. Unsurprisingly. So clear, in fact, that when the Republican presidential candidate issued a press release trumpeting the fact that he had filed his personal financial disclosure forms with the Federal Election Commission, he put his estimated total net worth in block capital letters: “TEN BILLION DOLLARS”. The FEC released Trump’s forms on Wednesday, giving us the clearest insight yet into the man’s wealth – although his team warned the forms were “not designed for a man of Mr Trump’s massive wealth”. Interestingly the snapshot already needs updating. The reality show and real estate billionaire’s vitriolic presidential campaign has so far cost him business deals. His candidacy raises some intriguing questions about the value of someone’s “personal brand” – and about the difference between their net worth and their income.  Even if we accept Trump’s estimate of what he is worth (and I’ll come back to that in a minute), there’s the question of his income. It’s still gargantuan by the standards of most Americans: $362m in 2014, according to the press release, not including dividends payments or interest that he earns on his investments, capital gains on any properties or investments that he sells or rents, and royalties.   The problem? The way that Trump has waged his presidential campaign is likely to send that income into a tailspin.    Related: John McCain: Trump's 'offensive' comment merits apology to military families     One after another, the companies that once lined up to get Trump to endorse everything from clothing lines to mattresses are pulling back, viewing his seal of approval on their products or services as anything but a positive factor in the wake of his rabble-rousing.   Why would NBC continue to fork over an estimated $250,000 per episode to Trump to host The Celebrity Apprentice, knowing that advertisers view him as toxic? Trump has stated – repeatedly – that he believes Mexican immigrants are “bringing drugs” and “bringing crime”; that some are “rapists and murderers”. His diatribes have left many within the ranks of his own party – not always known for their warm, fuzzy attitudes toward immigrants – aghast.   Understandably, Univision, the giant Spanish-language broadcasting network in the United States, promptly announced it wouldn’t carry any of Trump’s content going forward, including the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants. (NBC won’t air those, either.) Trump previously pegged a value of $14.8m on those pageants, jointly owned with NBCUniversal, but what are they worth if there’s no place to air them in some of the largest advertising markets? Will independent cable network Reelz be able to pay Trump nearly as much as he would have earned from Comcast and NBC for airing Miss USA, especially since some judges and contestants have announced their intention of dropping out?  And so it goes, drip, drip, drip, drip: a few million dollars here, a few million dollars there.   And it adds up. One media outlet estimated that Trump’s income has fallen by $50m. Forbes, meanwhile, has long disputed Trump’s own calculation of his net worth, pegging it at closer to $4.1bn. The difference? The value of the Trump brand. Trump himself reckons that this is $3.3bn; Forbes has calculated it to be a mere $125m. Until, that is, Trump decided to be his abrasive self in his campaign, after which Forbes wrote down the value of that brand to precisely zero.  And that was before the presidential candidate decided to deride his predecessor as a presidential candidate, a longtime bastion of the Senate, Arizona Republican John McCain. “He’s not a war hero” just because he was a prisoner of war, Trump told a gathering in Iowa last weekend. “I like people who weren’t captured.”  But in both politics and finance, Trump appears to be playing a long game.   Related: Trump remains in poll position despite comments on John McCain's service     Advertisers and specific groups may not like what he says, but his inflammatory comments about Hispanic immigrants clearly resonated with some American voters – or at least didn’t offend them enough to drown out the rest of his message. In a Washington Post/ABC News poll taken largely before his comments about McCain hit the headlines, Trump had taken over the lead in the Republican presidential race, with support of 24% of respondents – nearly twice as much as the next candidate.   And while Trump’s income may be falling precipitously, by any standard he’s the most affluent American ever to seek a presidential nomination. Since he’s financing his own campaign, he doesn’t need to worry about his ability to attract donors any more than he seems anxious about his ability to retain business sponsors.   Other celebrities have recovered from dents to their brand value. Consider Martha Stewart, who at the height of her fame as a domestic diva served prison time for charges related to insider trading. Viacom dumped her television show, just as it has severed its relationship with Trump. She had to resign from the board of the company named after her and fork over nearly $200,000 in fines and penalties to regulators. After her release, Stewart promptly went back to work and restored some of the luster to her brand. But the changes to the media landscape finally took their toll on the business, which she sold to Sequential Brands last month – for a 20% premium over recent values, but at a fraction of its peak value. Trump’s income is already damaged; his brand, too. Trump’s net worth is another matter. While the Forbes estimate is almost certainly closer to the truth than the TEN BILLION DOLLARS proclaimed by Trump himself – given that his net worth is made up of assets that can’t be readily sold, and whose value depends on what a market specialist thinks they could fetch – many of those assets are in premium locales. Some high-end tenants may not want to be in buildings with “Trump” on the outside anymore, but those buildings continue to occupy premium locations, on New York’s Fifth Avenue, for instance, or Columbus Circle. In real estate, location dictates value – and thus Trump’s net worth.  In the process of damaging his business brand, however, Trump is building a new and entirely different brand for himself – a political brand. It’s one that can’t be monetized in any kind of conventional way, and indeed may cost him money, but that seems to matter less and less to Trump. The remaining question is whether there are enough voters out there who share his views to result in his political brand becoming more closely aligned with that of the country as a whole.  That’s something that could be costly in an entirely different way.",2015-07-22T17:19:43Z,Donald Trump: a brand in danger or a daring re-invention?,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""9e81518d4ebec772dce39833c054e2eaec2371aa""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/22/1437577689202/8e7278c0-1f67-4818-90d9-b3a4de24fb44-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""donald trump"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Donald Trump speaks at his South Carolina campaign kickoff rally.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Stephen B Morton/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>",69,"The controversial Republican candidate has seen his poll numbers surge, but the building of his political fortunes has hurt his business success",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/22/1437577689617/8e7278c0-1f67-4818-90d9-b3a4de24fb44-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-money-blog/2015/jul/22/donald-trump-net-worth-political-brand,2,negative

"The safety net to ensure that vulnerable claimants are provided with legal aid and access to justice does not work, the high court has ruled. The Legal Aid Agency’s exceptional case funding scheme is “not in accordance with the law” and must be altered, Mr Justice Collins declared.    Related: Legal aid fees to be cut by 8.75%, confirms Ministry of Justice     His ruling, in a test case originally brought on behalf of a blind man who has cognitive impairments, follows widespread complaints from lawyers about difficulties in operating the last-resort funding mechanism. The Ministry of Justice said it would appeal against the decision. Labour’s justice spokesman, Andy Slaughter, called on the justice secretary, Michael Gove, to conduct an emergency review of the legislation.  “I am satisfied,” Collins said in his ruling, “that the scheme as operated is not providing the safety net promised by ministers and is not in accordance with section 10 [of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012] in that it does not ensure the applicants’ human rights are not breached or are not likely to be breached.  “A particular adverse effect of the LASPO reforms has been on family cases, and the increase in litigants who should have been granted legal assistance but have to appear in person.” The LAA is an executive agency of the Ministry of Justice. Exceptional funding was intended to support people whose entitlements under the European convention of human rights were at risk of being breached if they were not given legal aid.  The judge granted the LAA and the lord chancellor, also currently Michael Gove, permission to appeal against his ruling because of its widespread importance. Government lawyers gave the judge assurances that his ruling would be put into effect pending any appeal.  Application forms for exceptional funding for legal aid were “far too complex” for people having to fill them in without the help of lawyers. The judge called for more user-friendly forms to be provided.  Consideration should also be given to enabling lawyers to do work to see whether a claimant had a case which should be granted legal assistance, the judge said. The “merits test” applicants had to pass before being granted legal assistance was also flawed.  The judge added: “The rigidity of the merits test and the manner in which it is applied are in my judgment wholly unsatisfactory. They are not reasonable. There is a further defect in the failure to have any right of appeal to a judicial body where an individual who lacks capacity will otherwise be unable to access a court or tribunal.”  The case was brought by the Official Solicitor of England and Wales on behalf of a blind Nigerian national referred to as IS, who has lived in the UK for over 13 years and suffers from profound cognitive impairment. IS was seeking funding to enable him to apply to the Home Office to clarify his position in the UK as an immigrant but was refused exceptional funding.    Related: Ministry of Justice exceptional funding is for defending basic rights | Letters    He later won his case, but the Official Solicitor decided that, even though his individual challenge had become academic, the legal action should be continued because of concerns that the scheme was failing properly to deal with other claims from both children and adults who lacked capacity. The judge said in his ruling: “The importance of the issues raised in this claim has justified its continuation in what in effect amounts to a test case.”  The Official Solicitor was represented by the legal charity Public Law Project (PLP). Its director, Jo Hickman, welcomed the ruling, saying: “PLP has long been concerned about the practical operation of the ECF scheme. This welcome judgment will help to protect the interests of the many children, patients and other vulnerable adults who would otherwise be unable to achieve justice.”  ",2015-07-15T18:40:24Z,"Legal aid safety net does not work, rules UK high court","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""1bf94a6f1ea1fa766f9a4b3d0fb4fc43c5096d49""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/1bf94a6f1ea1fa766f9a4b3d0fb4fc43c5096d49/0_284_5616_3371/1000.jpg"" alt=""The Ministry of Justice said it would appeal against the decision by the high court, pictured."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The Ministry of Justice said it would appeal against the decision by the high court, pictured.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>",71,"Exceptional funding scheme must be altered to help vulnerable claimants, says Mr Justice Collins in test case following widespread complaints from lawyers",http://media.guim.co.uk/1bf94a6f1ea1fa766f9a4b3d0fb4fc43c5096d49/0_284_5616_3371/140.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/jul/15/legal-aid-safety-net-does-not-work-rules-uk-high-court,8,neutral
"Mhairi Black, in her first House of Commons speech, has declared herself the only 20-year-old in the country to whom the chancellor is willing to provide housing. In deriding the government’s plans to cut housing benefit for 18- to 21-year-olds, the Commons’ youngest MP shared the concerns of many charities working with homeless young people. Chancellor George Osborne, in the budget on 8 July, said the best route out of poverty is work. But for those whose housing situation keeps them furthest from the job market, the solution is not so simple.   Related: Housing benefit cuts for under-21s would be disastrous for young people    Here, at Homeless Link, we have real concerns that some current and proposed welfare policies are counter-intuitive, and could create unnecessary hurdles for the people most in need of help to escape poverty. The government’s plans to remove housing benefit from 18- to 21-year-olds is being sold as an incentive for young people to either “earn or learn”. Yet without the safety net that housing benefit provides, young people can find themselves pushed even further from the workforce. The most common cause of homelessness among under-25s is relationship breakdown. There are also those fleeing violence or mental and physical abuse, not to mention care leavers. For these young people, staying at home is not an option and housing benefit provides essential support as they move towards independent living. Without a stable home, many young people face additional barriers to work that cannot be addressed simply by removing access to benefits. Six in 10 homeless young people experience a range of complex needs (such as mental health problems) and half lack the basic skills to live independently.   Restricting access to benefits does little to help these people into jobs. Homeless people have a far harder time trying to find work than those with a home. Research into benefit sanctions, which normally occur when jobseekers fail to turn up for Jobcentre appointments, found that just 3% of people who receive jobseeker’s allowance are sanctioned – but among homeless people this rises to 33%. Existing help to support people into work is already proven to be failing those who are most vulnerable. We need a greater focus on homeless people and their needs in the assessment process, the design and delivery of employment programmes, and the conditions placed upon individuals seeking support.   Related: Housing benefit is a lifeline not a lifestyle | Letters    Many homeless charities have reported that their clients are being pushed further into destitution as a result of losing their benefits. The government has made the rules more flexible for those who are particularly vulnerable. It’s a welcome concession, but it should send a clear warning that such benefit-cutting measures can have damaging consequences.  Work is a route out of poverty only if there is a welfare safety net that recognises the value of a safe and stable home, and employment support that understands housing needs.

"There is no way for the Republican party to keep Donald Trump out of the debates now. On Wednesday afternoon, the outspoken billionaire and reality TV star announced that he had filed a personal financial disclosure with the Federal Election Commission, the last step needed to secure his presence on stage in the first Republican presidential debate in Cleveland on 6 August.   Related: Jeb Bush FEC filing reveals $8.3m cash on hand – and big lead in GOP money race – live    In a statement, Trump’s campaign announced in all capital letters that the real estate mogul’s “net worth is in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS” – more than previously reported. It went on to note that, not including “dividends, interest, capital gains, rents and royalties”, Trump’s income in 2014 was $362m. This suggests his wealth exceeds the total worth of 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, who was attacked for his wealth throughout the campaign. In Trump’s typical brash fashion, the former host of the Celebrity Apprentice also complained that FEC reports were “not designed for a man of Mr Trump’s massive wealth”, bragged about his acumen picking stocks and included the candidate’s confident proclamation: “I look forward to the challenge of winning the presidency and doing a fantastic job for our country.” The real estate mogul is currently leading in recent national polls of Republican primary voters and is appealing to many in the GOP base who are fed up with “establishment politicians” and are attracted to Trump’s fiery rhetoric on illegal immigration. However, Trump’s rise has come at a major cost, both to his portfolio and the GOP.   Related: Donald Trump campaign tweets photo with Nazi soldiers – then leads polls    Since Trump’s announcement speech in June, when he claimed undocumented immigrants crossing the border between the US and Mexico were “bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists”, a number of companies have ended their business relationships with him. Further, a number of fellow Republican candidates have condemned his rhetoric on immigration and RNC chair Reince Priebus reportedly called Trump to urge him to “tone down” his language. Trump has brushed aside this criticism and continued to rise in the polls.

"You launched Net-a-Porter 15 years ago from a small studio in London’s Chelsea. How has it changed? When we launched in 2000, we used American English to make us sound international and signed all our correspondence from “the Editors”, even though it was really just me and a couple of others packing the black boxes with clothes and ribbon bows. We were serving women who had access to a computer Monday to Friday: there would be a surge on Monday lunchtimes, then again last minute on a Friday. In those days, you had to unplug your home phone to get online, and you could drink a whole cup of coffee while a webpage uploaded. I do feel like I am reminiscing about a time when we had to milk our cows and make our own cheese. Now, we have 6 million unique visitors each month, sell more than 390 fashion brands 24/7 via mobile platforms and express ship to 170 countries worldwide. What do you know about your customers? Online browsing and shopping offers lots of data on our customers that you don’t get in offline stores: their sizes, their colour preferences, browsing patterns, shopping habits, average spend, the times they shop – it’s very common for women to make a purchase last thing at night from their smartphone in bed. We recommend products and designers they might like, based on purchase history or labels they “follow”. Do your customers want to see what they’d look like wearing things, perhaps with an avatar? No. Our consumers don’t like gimmicks. They don’t want things to spin around the screen or pop up. We’ve discovered they want good, honest words and really great photos that show full-length details. The majority want to be left alone and like self-service, but a small percentage of women treat technology as a conduit to old-world service and use our trained personal shoppers and customer care team as they might do in a traditional bricks-and-mortar boutique. How have shopping habits evolved? Female fashion consumers are always looking for something new, while we’ve learned with Mr Porter (the men’s fashion site launched in 2011) that guys tend to want more of what they already have. Women love the thrill of discovering new labels and being the first to wear them in their social set, so we are really developing our own curated collection of fledgling labels alongside the big established fashion names and now sell over 120 beauty brands. British designers have really enjoyed massive success and power in recent years, thanks to the reach of the internet. Technology shrinks and expands at the same time: we launched PORTER, our glossy shoppable print magazine in February 2014, because our customers enjoy 360-degree immersive experiences.   Related: Net-a-Porter merger with Yoox: marriage of very different high-end fashion sellers    You’ve just launched the Net Set, a social media app offering users the chance to create and join style tribes and follow other shoppers. Are you playing catchup in the social media arena? I wanted to purpose-build something for the mobile generation, so I briefed our team by saying, “what if there were a company out there setting up in competition with us, to be a modern multi-brand experience on mobile?” I asked the team to disrupt Net-a-Porter, rather than have someone else disrupt us. The Net Set is invitation-only at the moment, but the figures already prove it’s engaging as a shopping experience. We went from having a very controlled, one-way conversation with our customers, where we dictated what product was important, to saying “OK guys, now you create your own Net-a-Porter.” For a social network to work, you need a critical mass of users who set the boundaries. Then when you open the doors to the public, which we plan to do in the autumn, they arrive at a party that’s in full swing, rather than a party that hasn’t yet started. Your native language is fashion. Are you now bilingual and speak fluent tech, too? I can say API (application programming interface), and I can say Java, but I don’t feel entirely comfortable in the tech world. My family make fun of me as sometimes I can’t turn on the TV. I don’t understand why we need two remote controls. When we have an idea [at work], I trust the team to develop something to meet the brief: I don’t need to know the language. At 50, do you keep pace with evolving digital life? I have one foot on the dock, and one on the boat of technology, and I am going to make the massive leap on to the boat and embrace it. Am I navigating social and mobile in the same way my 15-year-old does? No. It is frightening and inspiring in the same breath. However, I admire my parents for listening to my music. I want to take the time to invest myself in new consumer habits. It would be suicide not to. I believe we must never fall in love with the way we are doing things, but we must always focus on what our consumers want. How do you spend your money?  Net-a-Porter. I shop just like anyone else. I can’t help myself. I use Deliveroo, (a premium restaurant delivery service) and Flowerbx for seasonal cut flowers. Amazon gets a tremendous amount of my money for books, gardening equipment and all that functional stuff. Very few of my purchases are made offline, because I don’t have time to walk round stores, and I hate going into stores in my raggedy jeans and seeing an assistant sneer at me. I love the way the internet has democratized shopping.   Related: Donatella Versace on Britpop, Instagram and why elitist fashion is over    What are your guilty pleasures when it comes to online habits? Instagram. It’s genius, truly life changing. And I am obsessed with all the property sites, such as Rightmove, StreetEasy and Trulia, which are all geo-location based. I love zooming in and out of cities I’ve never been to and comparing real estate. I was walking through London the other day with my dog and turned on Rightmove so I could see what was for sale in that area. Are you permanently connected? Some of my favourite things to do are connected with digital, for example, looking at pictures from my friends in California on Instagram, or coveting crazy properties online. I am connected because I want to be, not by obligation. It’s such a treat to live in these times, enjoying that voyage of discovery when you listen to a favourite track by Led Zeppelin and then get recommended contemporary artists that you might like, because of clever algorithms. My daughter has introduced me to Snapchat, but I only have her on my list. There is not a moment in our household where Snapchat isn’t going crazy – all her schoolfriends see me in my pyjamas at my kitchen table everyday. I do read old-fashioned magazines and books, though. The most I disconnect from the digital world is looking at the stars … but that’s being connected to the world in a different way. Where is the digital age taking us? There is the view that we are all going to hell in a handcart and it is the destruction of society and privacy and civilised human contact. But I am optimistic and choose to look at it as an incredible opportunity for transparency, knowledge, empathy, understanding and a platform for creativity. It will take us from being employees to having the potential to lead our own lives on our own terms. Once an egg-cup painter would work in isolation, in their own little space, but now they can connect that niche with an audience all over the world and that is so exciting. We can go back to enjoying a sense of community, albeit with a different shape to the traditional one, where people with shared interests can connect, wherever they are. I am not sure how education in schools can keep up with the information children have at their fingertips. The speed with which things can be done makes it challenging within traditional forms of education.",2015-07-10T08:00:06Z,Natalie Massenet: we must never fall in love with the way we are doing things,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""312a34f884acf303bc75515fe8014ae31993acfe""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436449009589/422e7b74-4403-4991-bbf5-d6d39a12f9f6-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Natalie Massenet in her office."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Natalie Massenet in her office.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: The Net-a-Porter Group</span> </figcaption> </figure>",74,"The Net-a-Porter fashion entrepreneur on getting started, shopping on a smartphone in bed and social media for style tribes",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436449009988/422e7b74-4403-4991-bbf5-d6d39a12f9f6-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/10/natalie-massenet-net-a-porter-technology-question-and-answer,2,positive
"It’s hard to imagine now, but just 15 years ago, the worldwide web was in its infancy in terms of consumer use: Google was only a year old and Facebook was four years away from being a status update in 15-year-old Mark Zuckerberg’s life. So when in the first months of the 21st century former Tatler fashion editor Natalie Massenet launched her designer fashion e-boutique Net-a-Porter and Nick Robertson gave the world an early incarnation of Asos, few understood the potential of the online fashion marketplace. “The general consensus was that people want to touch and try clothes before they buy,” recalls Massenet. “But I believed we had a chance.” Massenet and her burgeoning 2,500 staff have nurtured Net-a-Porter to global success, and is set to complete a merger of her business with Italian online fashion giant Yoox later this year, with combined 2014 net revenues of £920m to become the most powerful fashion boutique on the planet. More importantly for the style-conscious shopper, she has spawned a generation of me-too startups desperate to ride the chic coat-tails of this standard-bearer for fashion e-commerce. According to Euromonitor, the digital fashion and footwear marketplace in Britain was worth £9bn in 2014, and will grow to £10.8bn by 2019. Last week, Asos, which aggregates high street brands and own-label stock in a vast, virtual department store, reported that active users rose by 11% to 9.7 million in the past year. One of the first retailers to launch an app on the Apple Watch, founder Robertson says he was initially sceptical about the potential of mobile commerce. “I didn’t believe customers would want to shop 75,000 products on [a mobile or watch], but they are, and in increasing number.”   Related: Who is the real Anna Wintour?    This shift from desktop to portable device has seen an explosion in peripheral fashion sites that facilitate the discovery process, share style inspiration or streamline purchasing with universal checkouts. Among them, tech investor Chris Morton launched Lyst four years ago, applying the Spotify model of music discovery to the fashion sector. Lyst users browse and discover 11,000 designer brands and premium boutiques in one portal, then make multiple purchases averaging £260 apiece in one quick transaction. “The [kind of] algorithms that recommend tracks or artists based on your listening habits translate well for the emotionally driven fashion market,” explains Morton, who has seen Lyst grow 300% year-on-year for the past three years. “For true functionality we needed a vast inventory, so we have about 2.5 million products online at any one time [to put that in perspective, the largest department stores have around 30,000], but we are a tech company, not a retailer. Our commercial partners do the fulfilment of the sale: we simply create an incredible shop window that becomes more and more bespoke as you create your personal profile.” Other user-driven sites have helped the exponential growth of digital fashion shopping: Pinterest and Instagram began as image-based inspiration sites, but brands now use them as powerful marketing tools. eBay spawned a new generation of savvy vintage shoppers, who now love sites such as Vestiaire Collective, Tradesy, Instantluxe, Hardlyeverwornit and more, while businesses including Yoox, Cocosa, Brand Alley and Gilt Group sell off-season items from designer houses. Meanwhile, Farfetch has created a global showcase for small independent designer boutiques, while Moda Operandi offers unprecedented access for the public to pre-order high-end garments, accessories and fine jewellery, guaranteeing early delivery of items they’ve coveted on the catwalk. Online marketplaces such as Etsy, Folksy and Notonthehighstreet allow small-scale producers to offer varying levels of bespoke styles; niche e-tailers specialising in hosiery, sunglasses, Breton tops, swimwear, kaftans, Greek sandals and more are a viable proposition in the virtual marketplace, where the only prerequisites for trading are a PayPal account, a mode of delivery and a method for potential customers to discover your wares.   Related: Can hipsters save the world?    London is the beating heart of fashion’s e-commerce drive, with tech analyst Crunchbase estimating that about 60 digital fashion startups launched in the capital in the past five years with new features regularly wheeled out. Last month, Ivailo Jordanov expanded his Styloko fashion site with the addition of the WantList app, widely described as a Tinder for fashionistas. “Swiping is the quickest and simplest way for consumers to like or dislike something, and we then glean that data instantly. The more items they swipe, the more we can analyse preferences and hone their WantList to their personal style,” he says. Styloko CEO Shannon Edwards says they “have a vision of eliminating Google in fashion, because with traditional search engines you are beholden to descriptions and key words that match the retailer’s or the brand’s, which is too much of a gamble. That doesn’t replicate how we shop, because we are enticed visually by details, so this process refines the online fashion discovery process in a similar way.” The ultimate desire of the digital fashion world is, of course, image recognition software, allowing users to scan a TV screen, photo or person on the street and identify their outfit or find a similar one. This coveted “Shazam for fashion” facility would make the entire world shoppable and substantially shorten the path from picture to purchase, and the significant levels of investment in the arena shows how lucrative it could be for retailers and investors if it works. But thus far, no algorithm has been developed to mimic brain processing in terms of subtle but critical differences in colour, texture, cut, drape and the like. The day that a programmer can account for the nuances of taste will, without any doubt, change the landscape of fashion commerce for ever.  This article was corrected on the 10 July 2015 to clarify the position of Net-a-Porter’s merger with Yoox.

"Scientists have linked together the brains of three monkeys, allowing the animals to join forces and control an avatar arm, in research that raises the prospect of direct brain-to-brain interfaces in humans. In a second experiment, the brains of four rats were wired together in a “brain net”, enabling the rodents to synchronise their neuronal activity and collaboratively solve a simple weather forecasting problem that individual rats struggled to complete. The experiments, which have echoes of the Borg, a sinister alien collective in Star Trek, challenge the notion that our minds will always be ultimately isolated from those of others. Miguel Nicolelis, the Duke University scientist behind the work, has previously pioneered the development of brain-machine interfaces that could allow amputees and paralysed people to directly control prosthetic limbs and exoskeletons. His latest advance may have clinical benefits in brain rehabilitation, he predicts, but could also pave the way for “organic computers” - collectives of animal brains linked together to solve problems. “Essentially we created a super-brain,” he said. “A collective brain created from three monkey brains. Nobody has ever done that before.” He dismissed comparisons with science fiction plots, however, saying: “We’re conditioned by movies and Hollywood to think that everything related to science is dangerous and scary. These scary scenarios never crossed my mind and I’m the one doing the experiments.”  Anders Sandberg, a neuroethics researcher at the University of Oxford, said the work was the most convincing demonstration yet that brains can be linked together in direct communication. “People have claimed digital telepathy in various cool demos, but it’s mostly been total hype,” he said. “I’m quite impressed by this. It has a high ‘gosh’ factor.” In the first study, scientists fitted three rhesus macaque monkeys with arrays that could record electrical activity from hundreds of neurons in the motor region of the brain. The monkeys learnt, independently, to control the 3D movements of an avatar arm shown on a digital display in front of them, just by imagining moving it. The monkeys were then given joint control of the arm, with each monkey able to control two out of three dimensions (for instance, along the x- and y-axis) and their activity made a 50% contribution to each.  Although their brains were not directly wired together, the monkeys intuitively started to synchronise their brain activity, allowing them to move the arm collaboratively to a reach for a virtual ball on the screen. The system appeared to work, even if one of the three monkeys was temporarily distracted. “Even if one monkey dropped out in one trial, the brain net is resilient,” said Nicolelis. “Imagine if you had, not three, but a million. That would be extremely resilient.” In a second paper, also published in the journal Scientific Reports, the scientists directly linked the brains of rats together via two-way electrical connections that allowed the scientists to both deliver stimulus to neurons and read out electrical activity.  In one experiment, an electrical impulse was delivered to the brain of one rat, and the other rats learnt to synchronise their brain activity, mimicking the first rat’s brain response. In a sense, they were experiencing what the first rat felt, second-hand. In another demonstration, pulses of stimulation that increased or decreased were delivered to the brains of individual rats, representing temperature and barometric pressure information. The rats were able to combine the information to produce a collective output that predicted an increased or decreased chance of rain. Rats scored better on this task when they were linked as a “brain net”, than when individual rats tried to combine the two pieces of initial information – temperature and pressure – to perform the simple calculation alone. The scientists said that in the future, the concept might be extended to produce neurally connected “swarms” of rats with collective intelligence. Nicolelis said that in the long-term the work could have “tremendous benefits” for brain rehabilitation. After suffering a stroke, for instance, language abilities might be able to be restored more quickly if a patient’s brain was retrained by directly synchronising with the language regions of the brain of a healthy person. In humans, the link could potentially be made non-invasively using electrodes on the scalp, however. But he added it was unlikely that humans would ever be able to directly share complex mental experiences. “You’re not going to share your emotions or personality to a brain-net,” he said. “These are not reducible to a digital algorithm. You can’t reproduce these individual human attributes.” Ultimately, people may also decide that wiring themselves up with others is not entirely desirable. “There may be special instances where you’d want a long-term connection with someone – like a married couple or a military platoon,” said Sandberg. “But there’s no guarantee that brain-to-brain interfaces will be a sensible thing in practice. There’s something to be said for neural privacy.”",2015-07-09T16:26:53Z,Monkey 'brain net' raises prospect of human brain-to-brain connection,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""0d9ba2b406324330018ecb65855c9af759ff37b4""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436458606767/5db38157-f823-45d6-9ea5-cfee26cc5c1f-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Although science fiction hive minds are often terrifying, as The Borg in Star Trek, the scientists behind the “brain net” experiments believe it has many positive applications."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Although science fiction hive minds are often terrifying, as The Borg in Star Trek, the scientists behind the “brain net” experiments believe it has many positive applications.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Cinetext/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>",76,"In two separate experiments, scientists have formed a network from the brains of monkeys and rats, allowing them to co-operate and learn as a “superbrain”",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436458607139/5db38157-f823-45d6-9ea5-cfee26cc5c1f-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/09/monkey-brain-net-raises-prospect-of-human-brain-to-brain-connection,8,negative
"  Related: Good or bad for wellbeing? Three ways to judge the impact of big brands    1. Net positive is about giving more than you take “Net positive simply means putting more back into the environment or society than you take out,” says Forum for the Future’s chief executive, Sally Uren. It aims to restore or regenerate ecological systems, explains Steve Downing, director of the Henley Centre for Sustainable Enterprise. This is different from eco-efficiency, which simply slows down the decline in ecological capital, and closed-loop systems, which only prevent further ecological decline. 2. Boundaries are important Solitaire Townsend, co-founder of Futerra explains that the ultimate benchmark for net positive strategies are planetary boundaries (the boundaries within which humanity can continue to develop and thrive) and that goals and targets should always be developed within that framework. Uren adds: “If your biggest impacts are societal, than that’s where you should focus. However, the principles that we have developed tell us that there should be no irreplaceable natural losses. A big positive societal impact then isn’t justified at the expense of a large negative environmental one.” 3. It isn’t just repackaged CSR Net positive is far more transformative and ambitious than corporate social responsibility. It’s not just about reducing impacts here and there, rather it requires a systems-based approach and the involvement of the entire business. It also allows businesses to engage employees and customers with a positive message around sustainability, rather than one of reduction. “When we advocate CSR, we’re often perceived as saying that business is inherently bad,” says sustainability consultant Sarah Holloway. “But net positive allows those who believe business is a force for good to get excited about sustainability.” While it’s possible for a tobacco company to claim it is the most sustainable of its competitors, it should be impossible to claim it is net positive, says Townsend. 4. Greenwash is difficult Genuinely becoming net positive requires companies to focus on their main areas of impact. Dax Lovegrove, director of sustainability and innovation at home improvement retailer Kingfisher, says the company’s main impact is forests, so it aims to create more forest than it uses. Its plan to become net positive includes sourcing timber responsibly, working with key suppliers and engaging governments in improving EU timber regulations. There will always be greenwashers who exploit sustainability for marketing purposes, but Lovegrove says dubious off-setting initiatives under the guise of net positive will not go unnoticed. “Most of us can spot when a company is on the money and when it is avoiding the issues … Those largely seen as doing little on sustainability, such as those in the fossil fuel industries, would do well to avoid claiming to have net positive commitments,” he says. For Gabi Zedlmayer, vice president and chief progress officer at IT giant HP, a set of internationally agreed upon standards for offsets would help prevent their use for window-dressing.   Related: Las Vegas casinos gamble their reputations on sustainability    5. Fossil fuels and gambling are out If fossil fuel companies can’t be net positive, what about other controversial businesses, such as alcohol and gambling? Bill Baue, co-founder of Sustainability Context, says some business models are predicated on a net negative impact and would have a difficult time justifying the consequences of their products and services.  Uren also struggles with gambling but doesn’t write off alcohol companies. “You could envisage a micro-brewery, nestled in a close-knit community, powered off renewable energy, with 100% sustainable sourcing, having a net positive impact.” 6. It can be a great springboard for entrepreneurs  Net positive feels like a large corporate agenda, but it’s also a great starting point for budding entrepreneurs. One example is condom brand Sustain, which according to its founder is focused on challenging negative attitudes to condoms among young American women. For small and medium enterprises it can be harder to get the intellectual distance needed to critique your own business model, says Bruce Davis, joint managing director at renewables investment vehicle Abundance Generation. “I think that net positive SMEs are probably born rather than re-made,” he says.  7. Profit isn’t the measure of success “We are very comfortable ‘borrowing’ from our future selves to finance our present wellbeing and less comfortable investing in others’ future wellbeing,” says Davis. In the future, instead of success being defined in terms of profit, as it is in the selfish shareholder model, the success of a business will be measured by its net positive impact.

"The UK population is at a record high, official figures show, with net migration having overtaken natural population change to become the largest contributor to growth. The Office for National Statistics said 582,600 migrants arrived in the UK between mid-2013 and mid-2014, compared with 322,900 people who left the country. An ONS spokesman said the statistics meant the UK population had grown by 491,100 since2013, a 0.77% rise to 64,596,800. This is marginally higher than the annual increase of 0.75% seen over the last decade. The last year in which net migration was larger than natural population growth – the balance of births and deaths – was 2011.   population growth   The number of births in the year to mid-2014 was down compared with the previous year, continuing the downward trend seen since 2012, an indication that last decade’s baby boom could be slowing. The “natural growth” of the population was 226,200 (777,400 births minus 551,200 deaths) in the 12 months to mid-2014. Births accounted for 46% of the population growth, but migration accounted for 53%, the widest gap between the two figures since 2008. The other 1% growth was the result other changes and adjustments, mainly in the armed forces. Carlos Vargas-Silva, a senior researcher at Oxford University’s migration observatory, said the figures were not surprising. “Over the previous three years net migration decreased compared to the pre-recession levels. That was an exception. But the numbers of net migration and natural change can go back and forth. While this year net migration is the biggest contributor to population growth, next year it might be different.” He also pointed out that the net migration figure did reflect the overall impact of migration in the UK. “This is not a holding pack of migration, it is net migration. When people come to this country they will have children and that will also contribute to population growth, but it will be part of the natural change component.  “Within the EU, people are coming to the UK for employment. It’s a combination of the push factor – high EU unemployment – and the pull factor – a strong UK economy and availability of low-skilled jobs. Outside of the EU, study has been a key factor.” The statistics also reveal that the number of deaths in the UK has fallen since last year and is at its lowest for more than 50 years. The median age of the UK population now stands at 40, the highest ever estimated.   ageing population   There are more than 11.4 million people aged 65 and over, up from 11.1 million the previous year. The number of men aged 85 and over has increased by 61.8% over the past decade, compared with an increase of 25.9% for women, driven largely by changes in smoking habits and advances in the treatment of circulatory illnesses. Population growth was the greatest in southern and eastern England, at 1.08% and 0.92% respectively. London had the highest growth, with population in the capital up 1.45%, a result of 82,400 more births than deaths and the highest net international migration of all regions at 107,400. London also continued its pattern of having the greatest outflow of people to other parts of the UK , with more people of every age group except 21 to 28-year-olds leaving the city. The local authority with the greatest population rise was the City of London, up 5.54%, followed by Tower Hamlets up 4.08% and Westminster up 2.84%, all the result of migration. Forest Heath came fourth because of an increase in the number of armed forces in the area. The estimated population of England as of mid-2014 was 54.3 million, up 0.84%; Scotland was 5.3 million, up 0.37%; Wales was 3.1 million, up 0.31%; and Northern Ireland was 1.8 million, up 0.59%. No country of the UK or region of England witnessed population decline. Simon Ross, the chief executive of Population Matters, the UK’s leading charity working on population and sustainability issues, said the ONS estimates were a warning of the urgency of attempting to to reduce population growth. “We are all affected adversely by the rapid population growth of recent decades,” Ross said. “Examples include pressure on housing and public services to the environment and climate change. It’s time we addressed the population problem, and find ways to live sustainably and happily in the long-term. “As a nation we need to invest more in addressing these issues. Our emphasis should be on improved family planning and women’s education and empowerment, together with public information campaigns about the immense strains population and consumption growth place on our planet.”  • This article was amended on 29 June 2015. An earlier version said “There were 226,200 births last year, a quarter of which were to mothers born outside the UK.” In fact 226,200 is the “natural growth” of the population from mid-2013 to mid-2014, and about a quarter of the births in the UK in 2013 were to mothers born outside the UK.",2015-06-25T11:34:58Z,"UK population at record high, with net migration the biggest driver","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""4df0fe024aea8e161dae645d78a9a59cfb24d2f6""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/4df0fe024aea8e161dae645d78a9a59cfb24d2f6/325_0_6836_4103/1000.jpg"" alt=""Crowds on Oxford Street in central London"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Crowds on Oxford Street in central London.

"Sometimes the ways of the European Commission are simply too mystifying to fathom. What is one to make of an organisation which in one week decides that cookies – little text files that sit on your web browser and relate where you've gone online (but which you can control quickly and easily via preferences on your machine) must be regulated as though they were an outbreak of Ebola fever, but says there's no need to impose ""net neutrality"" duties on telecoms companies?The importance of the two matters is vastly different. Cookies really aren't the end of the world. Net neutrality, or the absence of it, might be – or it could be the end of a digital startup's ambitions to become the next YouTube. The uncharitable view would be that the cookie-planters are bad at lobbying, and that the telecoms companies fared much better at knocking on European commissioner Neelie Kroes's door and saying ""Neelie, could we have a minute?"".The cookies thing? Let's go over that. The EC has determined that ""explicit consent"" must be obtained from ""every site visitor"" to install a cookie on their machine. Many people think this might mean something like a popup consent form. This would be a nightmare for all sorts of people, but most of all for you and me, the user. Have you ever tried navigating around a website (or the web) with the preference on your browser set to ""Ask me before accepting cookies""? It's like being stopped by every single person who passes you on the street, if the street were London's Oxford Street. On the last shopping day before Christmas.Sites set cookies for all sorts of reasons: to show you've logged in, to track if you've visited, to keep your shopping cart stocked. And yes, to serve adverts. The EC directive (which communications minister Ed Vaizey is desperately trying to make calming noises about) will affect pay-per-click advertisers and users of Google Analytics. Pretty much every European website will be affected, including guardian.co.uk.Are cookies bad? No, they're useful. Alex Sharratt of Impact Media puts it well: concerns over cookies as privacy-busters are like the worries over the Large Hadron Collider imploding the Earth into a black hole. Attention-grabbing, but absurd. Vaizey is trying to find a way of implementing the directive yet not causing total disruption to the internet business in the UK. And good luck to him.But net neutrality is a real issue. Imagine you have a brilliant video startup that relies on pumping gigabytes of data at high speed over networks to consumers. The&nbsp;sheer cost of bandwidth is bad enough – but internet service providers give you pained smiles and say you'll have to pay extra, or that high-speed video just isn't going to reach their customers. Without net neutrality, that's a realistic scenario.Kroes's (and Vaizey's) answer is not to worry – ISPs would be obliged to tell you if they do this. And then everyone would arise en masse and leave their ISP for another one. If, that is, they disapproved. This is nonsense. Look how much trouble people have shifting to the best-interest bank accounts – and that's about money, not some web service. Vaizey was told as much when the idea was floated at a net neutrality meeting in London with ISPs and content producers. The fact Sir Tim Berners-Lee favours net neutrality should be a clue which side to fight on.Why can't the EC see that net neutrality is one thing that will really make a difference to indigenous startups? It removes barriers to success, rather than putting them in the way of everyone. Maybe it is down to that lobbying differential. Loads of small companies rely on cookies. A few big ones don't want net neutrality. And look what happens.Is it too much to ask that Kroes will come to her senses? She has a team looking at mobile operators' neutrality, or lack of it – though she doesn't think that's a problem either, nor that safeguards are needed. For consumers, it's a world of hurt.",2011-04-25T06:00:06Z,Let the cookie crumble and give us&nbsp;net neutrality,,79,"<strong>Charles Arthur:</strong> Cookies really aren't the end of the world, while net neutrality is – but try telling that to Neelie Kroes",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/4/21/1303404469424/Neelie-Kroes-003.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/media/blog/2011/apr/25/cookies-net-neutrality,4,neutral
"Donald Trump, the billionaire real estate mogul, valued his fortune at $9bn as he officially entered the race for the White House.   Related: Donald Trump the latest Republican to announce run for US president    Publishing the most detailed summary of his financial worth in years, Trump said his portfolio of hotels, other properties and media assets, including Miss Universe, was worth over $8.7bn, once liabilities were removed.  Giving a reckoning of finances is a requirement for presidential candidates, and after a series of dud runs for office, Trump’s move heralded a more serious bid for the nomination. “I have total net worth of $8.73bn,” he said. “I’m not doing that to brag. I’m doing that to show that’s the kind of thinking our country needs.” According to the statement, most of Trump’s wealth comes from real estate licensing deals, brand and branded developments, listed as worth more than $3.32bn. His commercial property was valued at over$1.69bn. The Miss Universe, Miss USA and Miss Teen USA Pageants were valued at $14.8m, and Trump listed $302.3m in cash on hand. His total assets were valued at $9.24bn and liabilities totalled $502.7m.           Trump: ‘I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created’ - video    The declaration is unlikely to end an often heated and litigious debate over Trump’s real worth. At $8.7bn, the list of assets is more than double Forbes magazine’s assessment of Trump’s wealth, which pegs his net holdings at $4.1bn.  In 2009, a judge dismissed a defamation suit Trump brought against Timothy O’Brien, author of Trump Nation: The Art of Being the Donald. O’Brien estimated Trump’s wealth at $150m to $250m. Trump’s estimate at the time the book was published was $5bn. The property baron-turned-reality TV star clearly sees his wealth as a key asset in the race. “I’m the most successful person ever to run for the presidency, by far,” he told Des Moines Register this month. “Nobody’s ever been more successful than me. I’m the most successful person ever to run. Ross Perot isn’t successful like me. Romney – I have a Gucci store that’s worth more than Romney.”           A brief history of Donald Trump’s presidential aspirations – video    Trump’s figure (or Forbes’ estimate) would make him by far the wealthiest of the contenders in the 2016 race for the presidency – now at 16 and counting. Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett Packard boss, has a fortune worth $59m. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, and husband Bill earned $30m in the past 16 months, according to recent disclosures. Trump will have to file a far more detailed financial statement with the office of government ethics (OGE) if he is to pursue a run for the presidency. That statement will offer a closer read of his assets and liabilities and include those of his spouse.

"Last Sunday, on the eve the wireless industry's largest tradeshow in Orlando, AT&amp;T announced its plan to buy rival mobile service provider T-Mobile USA for $39bn. Were this merger allowed to proceed, AT&amp;T would control more than 40% of all US wireless subscribers. (By way of comparison, the combined T-Mobile UK and Orange will control 37% of the UK mobile market.) Together, AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless would be an effective wireless duopoly, controlling nearly 80% of the market.The significance of this type of consolidation can hardly be overstated: in a society where policymakers prefer to rely on competition – rather than regulation – to protect consumers, AT&amp;T's proposed merger with T-Mobile could have serious ramifications for mobile phone users. Consumers' pocketbooks will likely be the hardest hit. T-Mobile caters to more price-sensitive customers; with its affordable monthly plans out of the picture, AT&amp;T and Verizon will feel less pressure to compete on price with the far smaller Sprint, a company that the Wall Street Journal noted would be ""a marginal No 3 player"".And this merger could lead to even greater price hikes for visitors to the US from abroad and Americans who travel frequently. Since T-Mobile and AT&amp;T are the only major US carriers that use the GSM standard – the most popular mobile standard worldwide – AT&amp;T could soon find itself with virtually no competition for these two classes of users. Overall, mobile phone users can expect higher bills, longer contracts and more hidden and confusing fees, if this merger comes to pass.But the harms to consumers wouldn't just be monetary. In addition to its lower prices, T-Mobile is also known for its more user-friendly data policies. Unlike AT&amp;T, which caps monthly data use, T-Mobile offers unlimited data plans to its users. What's more, AT&amp;T's most generous data plan, which allows for 4GB of usage a month (roughly 12-24 hours of streaming video), will cost you one-and-a-half-times what T-Mobile's unlimited plan will. And while T-Mobile has never prevented its users from accessing the sites and services of their choice over its network, AT&amp;T has, blocking access to Skype, Slingbox and Google Voice at various points during the last few years.This last point could prove especially harmful given the current state of net neutrality in the United States. The phrase ""net neutrality"" refers to the idea that all internet traffic should be treated equally and that service providers should not be allowed to block, slow or degrade traffic based on its type, point of origin or destination. Though net neutrality has many vocal supporters in the US, including Minnesota Senator Al Franken, thus far, policy solutions that would write the principle of net neutrality into law have excluded mobile data providers from the rules. A lack of competition in the wireless marketplace, combined with a lack of strong net neutrality rules, could allow AT&amp;T to block popular, high-bandwidth services like Netflix.Still, even as AT&amp;T works to cultivate an air of inevitability around this proposed merger, the company's acquisition of T-Mobile is anything but a fait accompli. Unlike the last large communications merger in the US, that of Comcast and NBC Universal, AT&amp;T's merger with T-Mobile would be a ""horizontal"" merger – that is to say, a merger of two companies that compete to provide the same types of services. The New York Times and the Washington Post have already expressed scepticism about the merger and the Economist – a publication known for it market-friendly views – advocates that it be blocked. Historically speaking, it is horizontal mergers that have attracted the most scrutiny from the federal government. It remains to be seen whether the department of justice, the Federal Communications Commission and the Obama administration possess the political will to deny this merger, but if they are to keep the best interests of wireless consumers in mind, then they should.",2011-04-01T18:30:00Z,The net neutrality threat of the T-Mobile merger with AT&amp;T,,81,"<p><strong>Mehan Jayasuriya:</strong> Unless the US government blocks AT&amp;T's T-Mobile bid, mobile phone and data customers may end up paying more for less</p>",http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2011/3/21/1300672323127/ATT-003.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/apr/01/net-neutrality-mobilephones,1,negative
"The idea of net positive has been around for a while. Simply put, it requires businesses to have more positive impacts than they do negative. In other words, the wellbeing of communities, society and the environment should be better because of their existence. That’s a tough ask for a company and there seems little agreement on how net positive works in practice. How impacts are measured and managed and how any company can prove it’s successfully becoming net positive are still up for discussion.  The likes of Kingfisher and Coca-Cola have been early champions of embedding net positive into their business model, albeit only for certain areas of operation such as forests and water. Is this enough? And which companies get to strive for the net positive label? More controversial companies are getting in on the act. Gambling company Caesars Entertainment, for example, has laid out a plethora of community, social and environmental goals – from recycling and repurposing to turning off the lights – as part of its aim to be a “good corporate citizen”. But when it’s core business rests on gambling, with all the social problems this can entail – some question whether it could ever be net positive for wellbeing. When it comes to wellbeing, can businesses genuinely become net positive or is it always a matter of trade offs? Join the live chat Join a panel of experts on Thursday 18 June, 1-2pm BST in the comments section of this page where they’ll be taking questions on the topic. Questions we’ll explore will include: • Is there enough agreement as to what net positive means and how it can be measured? • Is it enough for businesses to be net positive in one aspect, for example, water or forests? Or should it cross their entire operation? • Can more controversial businesses – for example alcohol or gambling businesses –have a net positive impact?  • Is negative impact worth paying the price for if companies enhance the wellbeing of their workers, customers and communities? • Should a company’s net positive impact be directly reflected in the benefits delivered by its core products and services?

"The inventor of the world wide web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, has warned internet service providers (ISPs) that plans for a ""two-speed"" internet go against the principles that have let the net grow so rapidly in the past two decades.""Best practices should also include the neutrality of the net,"" Berners-Lee told a round table in Westminster on Wednesday morning, convened by the communications minister Ed Vaizey. Content companies, represented by Facebook, Skype, the BBC and Yahoo, squared up to ISPs, with input from consumer representatives including the Open Rights Group, the Consumers' Association and the communications regulator Ofcom.Jim Killock of the Open Rights Group, who was representing consumer interests at the meeting, said afterwards that he was concerned about the direction the debate was going: ""The potential for something going terribly wrong is absolutely there. The regulator and government do not wish to intervene, for good reason; but industry is not putting forward anything that looks like meaningful self-regulation.""ISPs have for years sought to charge the BBC or customers, or both, for the huge amounts of data transferred over their networks by applications such as the iPlayer, whose popularity has exploded in the past few years. ISPs have to pay for carriage of data from BT's core network to customers, but offer unmetered services on broadband – meaning that when people's demand for data grows, ISPs can be out of pocket.But the BBC and other content providers such as YouTube have resisted calls that they should pay, on the basis that they are providing a service that allows the ISPs to find customers. In response, ISPs both in the US and Europe have mooted the idea of ""two-tier"" connections where some services are slower than others. Skype complained at the meeting that its service is effectively blocked on all of the mobile services in the UK except 3, meaning that carriers are violating the principle of net neutrality because they fear it will affect their call revenues.Berners-Lee told the meeting that ""every customer should be able to access every service, and every service should be able to access every customer ... The web has grown so fast precisely because we have had two independent markets, one for connectivity, and the other for content and applications.""Vaizey said the meeting had been ""useful and productive"" and that ""it was important to discuss how to ensure the internet remains an open, innovative and competitive place.""""Net neutrality"" – in which services are treated exactly equally as they pass over the net, no matter what their source or destination – has become an increasingly vexed topic as demands on ISPs and mobile carriers have begun to outstrip capacity.ISPs have thus suggested that they should be allowed to manipulate the transfer of data, but that they would be transparent about how and what they were doing.On Monday the Broadband Stakeholder Group launched a new traffic management transparency code, which has since been signed by the largest fixed-line and mobile carriers, including BSkyB, BT, Everything Everywhere (formerly Orange and T-Mobile), TalkTalk, 3, Virgin Media and Vodafone. Together they represent more than 90% of all fixed-line broadband and mobile customers in the UK.It pledges that ""information will be provided in a common format to explain what traffic management techniques are used, when and with what impact for each broadband service currently marketed by the code's signatories.""But Rob Reid, senior policy adviser at the Consumers' Association, who was among the attendees at the meeting, said that there was concern that transparency was only one half of the required commitment – because users might be tied into contracts lasting 18 months or more, meaning that if they disliked a change to the traffic management policy it would be expensive to switch to a different provider who offered one they preferred.Antony Walker, the chief executive of the Broadband Stakeholder Group, told the Guardian: ""The issue of [customer] switching is critical. It's the other side of the coin to transparency. Ofcom is working on guidance on this and it is an issue that was highlighted. Everybody agrees that it is important.""Adding faster systems would only work as a short-term measure to relieve congestion on networks, said Walker: ""it's like adding more lanes to the M25 – it just attracts more cars. Having faster networks will mean that people will want more services using more data.""But Killock said that not enough was being done yet: ""In contrast with the US, where rules are being put in place through the Federal Communications Commission, or Norway where ISPs have agreed a meaningful code, our ISPs are not offering us what we and the UK economy needs. If that continues to be the case, then Ed Vaizey will find himself with the task of breaking the log jam.""",2011-03-16T19:01:43Z,Berners-Lee warns ISPs on net neutrality,,84,Inventor of world wide web says plans for 'two-speed' internet go against its principles.

"Democratic senator Al Franken has has issued a rallying cry to ""innovators and entrepreneurs"" at SXSW to fight back against Comcast and other companies lobbying to pave the way for a two-speed internet.The principle of net neutrality, under which all content is delivered equally to internet users' homes, is ""in big trouble"", Franken warned in a passionate rallying cry at the conference on Monday.Franken's address was always going to be a preach to the converted – SXSW is the spiritual home for small, independent media and technology firms – but he warned that unless the 200,000 attendees ""use the internet to save the internet"", then big telecoms firms will muscle through plans for a two-tier net.""The one thing that big corporations have that we don't is the ability to purchase favourable political outcomes,"" he said.""Big corporations like the telecoms firms have lots of lobbyists – and good ones too. Every policy-maker in Washington is hearing much more from the anti-net neutrality side than the side without lobbyists. But everyone has more to fear from these big corporations than from us. [Their proposals] would benefit no one but them.""In the US, where the net neutrality debate rages on despite a conciliatory bill by the Federal Communications Commission in December, telecoms giant Verizon is fighting the rules in a bid to allow internet providers to choose which content they can charge for. Net neutrality advocates fear that internet providers, most pertinently Comcast which controls a large stake in both TV and internet provision, could downgrade rivals' content and boost delivery of their own.""[On today's internet] you don't need a record deal to make a song and have people hear it, or a major film studio for people to see your film, or a fancy R&amp;D job. But the party may almost be over,"" Franken said. ""There is nothing more motivated than a corporation that thinks it is leaving money on the table. They are coming on the internet and wanting to destroy its freedom and openness. All of this is bad for consumers but an outright disaster for the independent creative community.""Big corporations like Verizon and Comcast are not ""inherently evil,"" he added, but their duty to shareholders ""to make as much money as they can"" could change the internet for every American as they know it.Comcast was last month accused of effectively erecting a tollbooth that puts competitive video streaming service, namely Netflix, at a competitive disadvantage. Franken on Monday accused Comcast of thinly disguising its ""real endgame,"" which he argued was ""to put Netflix out of business"".He added: ""Today SXSW is a hotbed of creative entrepreneurship and innovation.""But what will it be 20 years from now? Will Americans have no choice but to consumer corporate content? Will entrepreneurs still matter? Or will conglomerates have so much control that only the innovations that they profit from will make it onto the market.""Let's not sell out. Let's not let the government sell us out.

"Here's a tale of two societies. The South Korean communications commission is planning to boost broadband speeds in that country tenfold by the end of 2012. That means Koreans will get one gigabit per second (Gbps) connections by next year, which is 200 times as fast as the 5Mbps ADSL connection which is common in the UK. Meanwhile, back in the middle ages (aka Whitehall next Wednesday), a ministerial summit on ""net neutrality"" convened by the culture secretary Ed Vaizey will hear how Britain's internet service providers (ISPs) plan to throttle still further the measly internet access they provide to the citizens of the UK in order to boost their bottom lines and reduce competition.Now it has to be said that the principle of net neutrality is not exactly a staple of saloon-bar conversation, so most citizens will assume that next Wednesday's discussions have nothing to do with them. In this, they are sadly mistaken – as they will discover if Ed Vaizey does indeed agree to let the ISPs violate or erode the principle. Their rude awakening will happen when, one future winter's evening, internet users decide that they would like to catch up on an episode of QI on the BBC iPlayer and find that the download is so slow and erratic that it's unwatchable. What will puzzle them even more is that videos from Sky not only come down in a whoosh, but play faultlessly in HD. And then, perhaps, the penny will drop. By which time, of course, it will be too late.The reason the internet has been such an powerful enabler of innovation is that it is, at its core, a meritocratic network which is not owned or controlled by anyone. All it does is take data packets in at one end and deliver them to their destinations at the other. And it was designed to be agnostic about the packets – to give them all the same treatment. In that sense, it was ""neutral"" towards applications. If you had a good idea that could be implemented in data packets, then the internet would do it for you, no questions asked.It was this neutrality that enabled the explosion of creativity triggered by the network. As Barbara van Schewick explains in a compelling book, Internet Architecture and Innovation, one implication of net neutrality was that the barriers to entry to the online market were incredibly low: all you needed was a good idea, programming skills and enough money to rent space on a server. So it's no accident that some of the most iconic internet businesses – Amazon, eBay, Google, Blogger and Facebook to name just five – were launched without any significant capital investment by anyone other than their founders and their friends and families.This is what makes cyberspace so different from the ""real"" world – where anyone seeking to create an innovative, disruptive business has to find a way of placating or buying off the incumbents. Net neutrality enables something radically different, what one might call ""permissionless innovation"".The Harvard scholar Lawrence Lessig illustrates this with a nice story about two Massachusetts ferrymen, Tom First and Tom Scott, who invented a juice drink that proved popular with their passengers. Slowly, it dawned on them that maybe there was a business here, so they founded Nantucket Nectars and built it into a company that was eventually sold to Cadbury Schweppes.But, writes Lessig, ""At each step after the first, along the way to giving their customers what they wanted, the two Toms had to ask permission from someone. They needed permission from a manufacturer to get into his plant. Permission from a distributor to get into her network. And permission from stores to get before the customer. Each step between the idea and the customer was a slog. They made the slog, and succeeded. But many try to make that slog and fail. Sometimes for good reasons. Sometimes not.""Critics of net neutrality argue that while it might have been appropriate in the early days of the net to treat all packets the same, it no longer makes sense because different applications have different needs. So it doesn't matter if the packets which make up an email message are delayed, but it's a real pain if that happens to packets in a Skype conversation or an iPlayer stream. And that's true. It would be and daft to insist on a neutrality that stifled new applications and technological progress. So an intelligent position for the government would be to allow ISPs to discriminate between different types of internet application (so long as it's done transparently), but ban them from favouring individual content providers.If Mr Vaizey fumbles this, then will the last entrepreneur emigrating to South Korea please switch off the lights.",2011-03-13T00:02:04Z,Why it's time to get off the fence about net neutrality,,86,"Some internet applications may be more equal than others but content providers need a level playing field, writes <strong>John Naughton</strong>",,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/13/government-must-keep-net-neutrality-principle,4,positive
"BT, Sky and Virgin Media – along with the rest of Britain's leading internet service providers – will next week outline an industry-wide ""code of practice"" on how they explain controversial ""two-speed internet"" policies to customers.The group will make their announcement at a ministerial summit on net neutrality chaired by culture minister Ed Vaizey – which will also be attended by Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the web and a strong supporter of net neutrality – on 16 March.The ISPs plan to publish how they manage internet traffic – such as video viewing, music streaming and movie downloading – in comparison to their rivals. That will make clear if they throttle popular services such as the BBC's iPlayer to maintain capacity for all customers on their network.However, the companies – whose ranks also include the leading mobile operators – will not commit to a minimum service standard, even though some phone companies believe that ""there should be a basic commitment to let people browse everything on the internet"".The agreement follows a wide-ranging debate on ""net neutrality"" – whether ISPs should be allowed to charge content companies such as the BBC or Google for faster delivery to the nation's homes.BT, TalkTalk and others argue that ISPs should be free to strike deals for more efficient delivery.Under the plans, described as a ""voluntary code of conduct"" by people at the meeting, ISPs will be compelled to publish a ""scorecard"" of how they speed up and slow down traffic and for which companies. But internet providers will still be allowed to throttle public access to video and peer-to-peer services if they wish.The Broadband Stakeholders Group, which has been facilitating meetings with ISPs on traffic management since late last year, will publish a statement shortly after the meeting. ISPs hope the move will head off an enforced code of practice by the communications regulator Ofcom.Most ISPs manage traffic at peak times to enable faster speeds for their customers. The BBC has been in fights with ISPs over the amount of bandwidth used to stream its  iPlayer service.In November, the corporation said it would introduce a ""traffic light system"" on the iPlayer, so that viewers could say whether their connection was being slowed down by providers.Mark Thompson, the BBC director general, publicly intervened in the net neutrality debate in January, saying an internet ""fast lane"" could undermine the corporation's responsibility to deliver programming to the nation's homes.""As the web becomes a vehicle for the transport of richer and richer content, the question of whether all content from all providers is treated equally by the networks becomes ever sharper,"" he said.",2011-03-09T14:29:00Z,ISPs to outline stance on net neutrality,,87,"BT, Sky and Virgin Media to explain 'two-speed internet' policies at summit on net neutrality.

"In 1931, James Truslow Adams, an investment banker turned Pulitzer-winning historian, wrote a book to name an idea that had been floating around since before the United States was a country. In his book, The Epic of America, Adams coined the “American Dream,” defining it as a notion “of social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable.” The European upper class, he wrote, would not understand. The dream says that if you work hard enough, you can make it in the US, and it is a damnable idea if ever there was one. The dream has allowed us to ignore that our social safety net has been shredded into cobwebs, because the dream tells us that if we work hard enough, we won’t ever need a net. And that entirely obscures reality. Stories about austerity measures in the EU don’t get much attention in the States, mainly because austerity is already our reality. Our safety net is knit together by charities and faith groups which do the work that government could more easily and efficiently accomplish. We ignore the reality that so many of our fellow citizens aren’t making it – and we ignore that the opportunity for social mobility is greater in other countries than it is here. Through the rose-colored glasses of the American Dream, the people who are falling short simply Are Not Trying Hard Enough. They’ve Earned Their Low Rung On the Ladder. Oh, and: They Are Sucking The Rest Of Us Dry. That’s by no means the attitude of everyone, but a significant portion of our conservatives (Hello, House Speaker John Boehner. See me waving?) would have us believe that your station in life is entirely of your own making, which is nonsense. If you were to ask Americans about austerity, we most likely would think you meant personal sacrifice, and we’re not having any of that, either. Back in 1977, our then-President Jimmy Carter appeared on television in a sweater to deliver what he called an “unpleasant talk” to urge Americans to do the radical thing and turn down their thermostats. His talk was not well-received; he was not re-elected. Here’s what living without a safety net looks like: Though strides are being made to prevent and end homelessness, our shelters are still full to bursting. In a few pockets around the country – notably, the western state of Utah and my own state of Connecticut – we are attempting to end homelessness by the simplest means possible: housing people. But in many other parts of the country, people would rather volunteer at a soup kitchen than examine the system that created the need for that kitchen in the first place. In a land without a safety net, children go to school hungry while right-wing politicians argue against serving them breakfast at school, in addition to lunch. That children can’t learn on an empty stomach – that breakfast is an investment in the future – is lost on so many of our leaders. In a land without a safety net, our budgets are too often balanced on the backs of the most vulnerable: our elderly, our veterans and our people who live with disabilities. But we love our CEOs, who make, according to a recent AFL-CIO report, 373 times the income of the average American worker. We love them because they are the living proof that the American Dream works. For a handful. Or less. And it helps to be born rich. It helps a lot. The EU’s riots, its activism that battles austerity measures, could be a powerful lesson for us. But that would mean fearlessly removing our rose-colored glasses, looking reality in the face and joining with the rest of the world to say, “Enough.”",2015-06-06T12:30:07Z,Americans live with the austerity you Europeans are so concerned about,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""3500f4bc7286b5d88e4f2667b3d0afdf67431b0a""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/3500f4bc7286b5d88e4f2667b3d0afdf67431b0a/0_84_3500_2101/1000.jpg"" alt=""lady with american flags"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">In a land without a safety net, children go to school hungry while right-wing politicians argue against serving them breakfast at school.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Randall Hill/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>",88,It’s hard to bemoan the loss of a safety net you never had.

"David Cameron and Theresa May have briefed the cabinet that they remain committed to the Tory ambition of ensuring net migration is cut to the tens of thousands of people. The prime minister and the home secretary outlined their plans at a meeting of the cabinet, which focused on the government’s legislative agenda that will be outlined in the Queen’s speech on 27 May. Ministers, who held a meeting of the political cabinet attended by Boris Johnson before the main cabinet, were also briefed by Andrew Parker, the director general of MI5, and by Robert Hannigan, the director of GCHQ. It is understood that the briefing focused on UK security threats rather than on the plans to reintroduce the “snooper’s charter”. Cameron is understood to have told the cabinet that he will show his determination to keep his word on Europe by publishing the bill to deliver an EU referendum the day after the Queen’s speech. The Queen will also announce that the government will introduce bills to abolish the Human Rights Act, which will be replaced by a British bill of rights; a schools bill to make it easier to allow failing or “coasting” schools to be turned into academies; and an enterprise bill to save at least £10bn by cutting red tape for companies. In addition to outlining to ministers the list of parliamentary bills, George Osborne, the chancellor of the exchequer, also gave the cabinet an economic update, while the prime minister and home secretary outlined their determination to cut net migration to the tens of thousands. The prime minister’s spokesman said of the policy: “That remains absolutely the case and the update very much reflected that.” Cameron and May faced criticism in the run-up to the election when the coalition missed its net migration target. The prime minister, who had delivered a “no ifs no buts” pledge in 2011 to deliver the target, was embarrassed a few weeks before the election when official figures showed that net migration to Britain was 298,000 last year. This meant that the net migration figure was 54,000 times higher than when the Tories made their pledge in 2010. But the Tories recommitted themselves in their general election manifesto to meeting the target, although they described it as an ambition. The manifesto blamed migration from the EU for its failure to meet their objective. “As a result, our action has not been enough to cut annual net migration to the tens of thousands,” the Tory manifesto said. “That ambition remains the right one. But it is clearly going to take more time, more work and more difficult long-term decisions to achieve. Continuing this vital work will be our priority over the next five years.” Downing Street said the prime minister’s EU reform plans, in which he will seek to limit access to in-work and out-of-work benefits to EU migrants, will be crucial in meeting the “ambition”. The prime minister’s spokesman said of the prime minister and home secretary’s briefing on immigration: “This brings together issues around skills and welfare reform to ensure that people can progress through the labour market and that work always pays, the measures around border and border force-related issues. Alongside that you also have the changes the prime minister and others seek in relation to the EU.” The No 10 spokesman played down the significance of the disclosure that Deutsche Bank is reviewing whether to move parts of its operations to Germany if the UK votes to leave the EU. The FT reported that the bank, which employs 9,000 people in the UK, has established a working group to plan for a potential exit from the UK. The prime minister’s spokesman said: “Some of these reports are considered in terms of this issue around certainty. The prime minister is the person who is providing certainty. He is the one that has the very clear plan to go and renegotiate our relationship with the EU and then put that to the British people.”",2015-05-19T14:05:46Z,David Cameron reiterates commitment to cutting net migration,"<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""e05489af66b5759294506a1d0706709ee66c17bc""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432044318037/e07ca8e3-82ff-4bdb-a067-d5554b3d607d-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""David Cameron says immigration remains a priority."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">David Cameron says immigration remains a priority.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Gregory Wrona/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>",89,Prime minister and Theresa May tell cabinet of determination to decrease net migration to the tens of thousands,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432044318366/e07ca8e3-82ff-4bdb-a067-d5554b3d607d-140x84.jpeg,http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/19/david-cameron-reiterates-commitment-to-cutting-net-migration,8,positive
"The desire for high-bandwidth internet services, such as internet TV is  placing ever greater demands on the internet's infrastructure. New technologies are being developed to meet these demands, but companies are increasingly considering new business models. With its Content Connect service, BT has brought itself into conflict with a fundamental design principle of the internet, raising concerns that the drive for profit could lead to changes that will harm consumers and content producers.The principle in question is that of net neutrality, which broadly states that data passing over the internet should be treated equally regardless of whose data it is. From a user's perspective this means that your ISP should not, for example, prioritise Google's traffic to you over Facebook's. Net neutrality is the cause of much debate and confusion. It is accepted that prioritising one type of data over another is necessary for the internet to function. An ISP will therefore give preference to voice or streaming video data, as these rely on swift delivery to be useful; however, preferentially treating one content provider's videos over another is considered unacceptable. Differentiation of service should therefore be made solely for engineering or quality-of-service considerations, and not for commercial exploitation.Proponents of net neutrality, such as the UK's Open Rights Group, argue that, by treating all content providers equally, the internet provides a level playing field that stimulates innovation and competition. If Google could pay to have their content delivered more quickly than Facebook's they would have a significant advantage, and smaller companies could be squeezed out of the market. This could result in a higher level of market domination by large companies, and in a ""tiered"" internet in which access to certain content requires extra payment for premium services.BT's Content Connect service is a direct response to a demand for internet TV, and works by reducing the amount of data transferred across the internet by temporarily storing popular content close to end users. From a technical perspective, this is an excellent way to improve content delivery. The controversy is the business model that drives the service. Rather than agnostically storing popular content, such as the latest digital episode of Coronation Street, access is offered by ISPs to content providers such as Google, who must pay to have their content delivered at higher speeds and qualities. This allows those providers that can afford the service a significant advantage over those who cannot, these being relegated to the slower traditional network.The US has recently passed legislation supporting net neutrality, although the EU has indicated that it views such laws as unnecessary ""at this time"". But is net neutrality, as a principle, necessary or even desirable? Opponents have argued that, given the essentially democratic nature of the internet, market forces should be sufficient to regulate companies. If ISPs choose not to carry certain content then their customers will leave them for more content-rich providers. Indeed, by preventing commercial differentiation of services, opponents argue innovation by companies seeking profit will be stifled. BT itself has claimed to support net neutrality as a principle, but stated that ""service providers should also be free to strike commercial deals should content owners want a higher quality or assured service delivery"".As the debate continues, there is increasing pressure from companies to maximise profit while meeting the increasing demands of users. We can hope, and must ensure, that the factors driving the development of the internet sustain it as a free and open medium of exchange, and that the drive for profit is not allowed to override this ideal.",2011-01-05T22:00:01Z,Net neutrality: content and its discontents,,90,<p><strong>Joss Wright:</strong> The free and open ethos of the internet is at stake if prioritising data for profit becomes a reality</p>,,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/05/net-neutrality-prioritising-data-profit,4,positive
"Readers with long memories will recall the celebrated Schleswig-Holstein question. This referred to a bundle of thorny diplomatic and other issues arising from the relations of two duchies, Schleswig and Holstein, to the Danish crown and to the German Confederation. It was the bane of diplomats' lives in the late 19th century, but we remember it nowadays mainly because of Lord Palmerston's famous wisecrack about it. ""The Schleswig-Holstein question is so complicated,"" he said, ""that only three men in Europe have ever understood it. One was Prince Albert, who is dead. The second was a German professor who became mad. I am the third and I have forgotten all about it.""The issue of ""net neutrality"" is the Schleswig-Holstein question de nos jours. The problem is not that it is so complicated that only three people understand it; au contraire, thousands claim to comprehend it and therein lies the difficulty: their ""understandings"" differ so markedly, one from another. Some see neutrality as a sacred principle that defines the spirit of the open internet and explains its astonishing ability to stimulate disruptive innovation. At the other extreme, multimedia corporations – and some distinguished computer scientists – see it as a sacred cow that may hamper future rounds of innovation in online services.To appreciate the issue, we need to remember that the internet was designed to perform a single task – it takes in data packets at one end and does its best to deliver them to their destinations. Net neutrality means that the network should be agnostic about the content of the packets. It shouldn't care whether they contain fragments of emails, web pages, instant messages, music tracks, porn videos – whatever. As far as the network is concerned, they're just data packets and should receive equal treatment. According to this doctrine, any departure from this digital egalitarianism should be regarded with great suspicion. So, for example, if your ISP gave preferential treatment to data packets from the BBC iPlayer as against those from 4oD, it would be violating the doctrine, as it would if it took payments from Microsoft to prioritise Bing search results over those from Google.Every time a government agency dips a toe in the neutrality pond, there's a cacophony of contradictory reactions. And so it proved last week. On Tuesday, the US Federal Communications Commission, which has the power to set the rules for internet use in the US, issued a ruling which administered the latest kick to the hornets' nest. In an admirably succinct summary, my Guardian colleague Charles Arthur puts it thus: the FCC ""seems to have done the right thing – defending neutrality – for fixed-line broadband, but fumbled it on mobile"". This is because the proposed rules ""seem to allow mobile carriers to decide that they can introduce pay-per-service charges, so that Skype or YouTube or Facebook might be charged to get their content on to the networks; alternatively (or perhaps additionally), users who wanted those services might find themselves being charged extra. That, obviously, means that those services are not being treated in a 'neutral' way. Which means that you don't have net neutrality.""Or, to put in another way, the FCC seems to have endorsed net neutrality for the past (fixed-line internet connections) while abandoning it for the future.Does this matter? Yes, because while most people still get their internet connections via fixed-line broadband, the likelihood is that in 10 years' time a majority will access the net via wireless connections. And if the FCC ruling stands, the wireless sphere will be anything but neutral. It will be dominated by the carriers – the telcos – who see no merit in neutrality. Which is why some people feel that the FCC's decision effectively means kissing goodbye to the open internet.  ""The neutering of the internet is now the unofficial policy of the Federal Communications Commission,"" writes Dan Gillmor, for example. ""Contrary to the happy talk from FCC chairman Julius Genachowski... the move is well underway to turn the internet into a regulated playground for corporate giants.""Sceptics about net neutrality will doubtless portray this as an over-reaction. Until I read Tim Wu's new book – The Master Switch: the Rise and Fall of Information Empires (Knopf, 2010) – I might have agreed with them. But Professor Wu places all this in a more sombre context – of what he calls the Cycle. ""History shows,"" he writes, ""a typical progression of information technologies: from somebody's hobby to somebody's industry; from jury-rigged contraption to slick production marvel; from a freely accessible channel to one strictly controlled by a single corporation or cartel — from open to closed system.""Will the internet prove to be immune to Tim Wu's Cycle? I wouldn't bet on it.",2010-12-26T00:02:02Z,Is this the beginning of the end for the open internet?,,91,<strong>John Naughton</strong> ponders the thorny 'net neutrality question'… and asks if online democracy itself is at stake,,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/dec/26/net-neutrality-networker-john-naughton,4,positive
"The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) which has the power to set the rules for use and, more importantly, charging for internet use in the US, has passed ""limited"" net neutrality rules by a 3-2 vote which split along Democratic (yes) and Republican (no) party lines. It seems to have done the right thing - defending neutrality - for fixed-line broadband, but fumbled it on mobile, and the reason it gives for the latter is astonishing: it's because Android is open. Mull on that as we go along.The FCC portrays the decision on its own website as ""FCC Acts to Preserve Internet Freedom and Openness"" - and just to prove how free and open it is, then has the press release in two formats: Microsoft Word and Adobe PDF. (Just to add to the fun, I couldn't get them to download on Wednesday morning. Links to the documents, courtesy of Matt Temple and Angrygoat, at end.)Ars Technica notes that fixed-line broadband does seem to be getting net neutrality rules that you might recognise - where someone operating such a service ""shall not unreasonably discriminate in transmitting lawful network traffic over a consumer's broadband Internet access service"" - although ""Reasonable network management shall not constitute unreasonable discrimination"". And reasonable network management purposes ""include: ensuring network security and integrity, including by addressing traffic that is harmful to the network; addressing traffic that is unwanted by users (including by premise operators), such as by providing services or capabilities consistent with a user's choices regarding parental controls or security capabilities; and by reducing or mitigating the effects of congestion on the network.""However many people who are not in the FCC seem to think that it has not really preserved freedom or openness, and that it has really fumbled it on a particularly important field - mobile.The rules seem to allow mobile carriers to decide that they can introduce pay-per-service charges, so that Skype or YouTube or Facebook might be charged to get their content onto the networks; alternatively (or perhaps additionally) users who wanted those services might find themselves being charged extra. That, obviously, means that those services are not being treated in a ""neutral"" way. Which means that you don't have net neutrality.The gobsmacking reason given by the commissioners for not imposing net neutrality treatment on wireless? The fact that Google's Android is ""open"". Yes, you read that correctly: because there's a pseudo-open mobile operating system, therefore wireless networks don't need regulation about how they charge for content.Or to quote from the FCC statements as seen by some sites: ""Further, we recognize that there have been meaningful recent moves toward openness, including the introduction of open operating systems like Android. In addition, we anticipate soon seeing the effects on the market of the openness conditions we imposed on mobile providers that operate on upper 700 MHz C-Block spectrum, which includes Verizon Wireless, one of the largest mobile wireless carriers in the U.S.""In light of these considerations, we conclude it is appropriate to take measured steps at this time to protect the openness of the Internet when accessed through mobile broadband.""It's a stunning example of American legislature showing that it simply doesn't know enough to be trusted with big decisions. There's some rumbling at Engadget suggesting that Google might have lobbied with Verizon, which sells an estimated 80% of the Android phones sold in the US, in favour of this ""limited"" (actually: thin wedge-end) approach to differential charging.Political reaction was, frankly, befuddling. Ars Technica caught up with them: ""conservatives pledged their undying opposition to the decision. ""I had always held out hope that the FCC wouldn't really move to regulate the Internet, not until hell froze over,"" declared Randolph May of the Free State Foundation. ""I guess the fact that the temperature here in Washington has been not much above freezing for about two weeks now is not a good sign.""""Hard to see quite how the FCC is regulating the internet, except in the sense of protecting the weak (users) against the powerful (broadband and network operators). Possibly you need to drink a lot of tea.And this one: ""Voting against the move, Commissioner Robert M. McDowell warned that it would bring on an 'era of regulatory arbitrage,' chart a 'collision course with Congress,' and represented 'one of the darkest days in recent FCC history.'""We'll see.

"The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is today expected to formally approve controversial new rules on how internet users access content such as YouTube and Skype.Dubbed by one US senator as ""the most important free speech issue of our time"", the rules drawn up by the country's media and telecoms regulator would effectively create two levels of internet access – one delivered by traditional fixed-line broadband, and another by wireless and mobile providers.FCC members Michael Copps and Mignon Clyburn last night said they would support the proposal laid out by chairman Julius Genachowski. The five-member FCC panel is expected to approve the proposal in Washington later today.Fixed-line internet providers will be prevented from blocking content and online services from rival companies or providing preferential treatment to paying clients under the new rules.However, the new framework would allow mobile internet service providers to charge content companies for more efficient delivery to US homes. Wireless providers will also be allowed to block applications or services, providing that they are not competitors. Fixed-line and wireless provider Verizon, for example, would not be allowed to block access to Skype because it provides a rival voice service.The new rules also open the door for providers to charge customers more for using high-bandwidth services such as downloading or streaming videos on YouTube or online movie rental site Netflix.Today's vote represents the first time the principle of net neutrality – where all internet content is treated equally – has been formally ratified in the US. It is the culmination of five years of heated discussion over the future of the internet.In the UK, communications minister Ed Vaizey will have a close eye on the US regulatory framework as he looks to implement new rules governing how internet service providers such as BT and BSkyB deliver content to UK homes. A number of internet companies, including eBay, Skype and Yahoo wrote to Vaizey earlier this month urging him to enshrine the principles of net neutrality into law.Public interest groups and technology companies called the framework ""fake net neutrality"" and said the rules ""create a vague and shifting landscape, open to interpretation"", rather than enshrining principles of the open internet. Netflix, Skype and Amazon have also previously expressed reservations about the plans.Al Franken, the Democrat senator, said the vote would decide ""the most important free speech issue of our time"".""Imagine if Comcast customers couldn't watch Netflix, but were limited only to Comcast's video-on-demand service. Imagine if a cable news network could get its website to load faster on your computer than your favourite local political blog. Imagine if big corporations with their own agenda could decide who wins or loses online,"" Franken said on Monday.

"It turns out that theft is taken extremely seriously in the online fantasy role-playing game, Guild Wars 2. The penalty is humiliation and then death.  This week, a player named DarkSide was caught using a cheat program to teleport into buildings, kill powerful characters and make off with all the loot. When other players complained, some of them capturing video of the crime taking place, developer ArenaNet stepped in. Security lead Chris Cleary took control of the character in-game, stripped off all its valuable armour and then forced the avatar to run off a bridge, plunging to its digital demise. The player was then banned.  Conversing with the accusers on the game’s online forum, Cleary wrote: “We don’t need to see it in-game, sometimes good video evidence is enough for me to track down who it was. In this case, the video was enough for me to find out who it was and take action.”            In the video, the character is seen having his floor-length coat and attractive yellow hat removed, before he walks to the edge of a stone bridge. He then waves and throws himself off.  Other players later expressed themselves satisfied that justice had been done, with one forum user commenting: “That’s pretty gangster.” It’s common for developers to closely monitor online game servers for players who use hacks, third-party tools or exploits to cheat the system. Usually, they are simply banned, but sometimes more drastic action is taken to make an example of the perpetrator.  Earlier this year, Grand Theft Auto publisher Rockstar found that some players of GTA V were exploiting a bug that allowed them to access a powerful vehicle in the online multiplayer mode that was only supposed to be available in the single-player campaign. The studio then patched the game so that the car would explode if used online. There are of course moral questions surrounding the use of humiliation and “execution” as a form of public punishment within virtual environments. Despite this – or perhaps because of it – the video of DarkSide’s demise has already been viewed by over 300,000 people, hungry for a peculiar display of gaming justice.",2015-05-08T14:42:58Z,"Video game execution watched by 325,000 players","<figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""9f4e022c815dbb149b387c10057e1544c4f8aed0""> <img src=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/8/1431094065944/7cbcfec0-28d8-4d31-b506-c1b05fc2a4d0-460x276.png"" alt=""Guild Wars 2"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A character owned by a cheating Guild Wars 2 player is forced to hurl himself into the abyss after failing to follow accepted ‘siege etiquette’</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>",94,A character in the fantasy adventure game Guild Wars 2 was stripped and thrown to his death after using a third party tool to access valuable properties,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/8/1431094066407/7b730561-4b20-4f8e-9e24-8a3974cc41e9-140x84.png,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/08/video-game-execution-guild-wars-2-arena-net,2,negative
"A coalition of internet and venture capital companies and pressure groups have written to communications minister Ed Vaizey calling for a clear political commitment from the government to preserve net neutrality. They say it must adopt five key principles – including openness, minimisation of data traffic management, and a strong regulatory framework.The open letter, which is signed by representatives from eBay, Skype, Yahoo, the music site we7, the software service The Filter, VOIP provider Truphone, the Open Rights Group, the National Union of Journalists, the reviews site Reevoo, the e-retail representative Interactive Media in Retail Group (IMRG), Eden Ventures, Ariadne Capital, Consumer Focus, TechHub, the consumer group Which?, Article 19 and the Coalition for a Digital Economy (Coadec), says that it welcomes Vaizey's earlier statements on net neutrality.But the government's support of net neutrality principles must be enshrined into law to ensure that internet users do not face ""arbitrary restrictions"" when accessing content such as the BBC iPlayer or YouTube, the open letter says.The BBC is not a signatory to the letter, but it is understood that this is not because it disagrees with the suggestion, but because it was not able to clear it through internal regulatory procedures before the other parties wanted to push it forward. BBC representatives have repeatedly spoken in favour of an open net without ISP-based restrictions that would prevent people accessing its content.Vaizey last month appeared to open the door to a ""two-speed"" internet where service providers such as BT and Virgin Media would be allowed to charge content providers such as the BBC for faster transmission to the nation's homes. However, he later clarified that ISPs should not be able to prioritise one provider's content over another and that they should not be able to relegate traffic-hungry services to an internet slow lane.Today the coalition of 19 organisations urges the government to reflect this commitment with ""action on the ground"", warning that it is a ""crucial"" subject for the ""wellbeing"" of society and future competitiveness of the UK's economy.Traffic management, the letter says, ""should be kept to a minimum"" and used purely for ""technical, security or legal reasons"", such as managing high volumes of internet users at peak times. Internet providers should also be transparent about traffic shaping policies and invest in infrastructure to ensure that ""new models of internet access [such as mobile and 3G] do not compromise openness"".""The internet should remain open so that everyone is able to send and receive the content, use the services and run the application of their choice, on the device of their choice, within the law,"" the open letter states.""End-users' choice of which applications, content, and services to view, use or run is already restricted in the UK today, especially when accessing the internet on mobile. The government's commitment to the open Internet must be reflected in action on the ground to remove any such arbitrary restrictions to the open internet.""The letter, which was also sent to culture secretary Jeremy Hunt and business secretary Vince Cable, further calls on the government to enact new EU legislation on electronic communications. Media regulator Ofcom, it says, should play a more proactive role in ensuring that the nation's internet users are not being harmed by restrictions on access to some services.It also calls for a ""wide-ranging policy debate"" on what it calls a ""crucial subject for the future competitiveness of the UK's economy and wellbeing of UK society"".Internet providers – particularly two of the largest, BT and TalkTalk – have wanted to charge the providers of traffic-hungry services such as the BBC iPlayer to ensure their content is delivered swiftly at a time when its network is coming under strain from increasing use of such services. The arrival of the iPlayer in particular in 2007 meant that ISPs' bills from BT's Wholesale division (which transfers data across the network to ISP endpoints) rocketed, causing suggestions that the BBC should have to share some of the cost of the transfer.But content companies, such as Google's YouTube and the BBC, have long argued that such measures would stifle online innovation and freedom of expression.BT insists that ISPs ""should be free to strike commercial deals"" with content providers who want ""a higher quality of service delivery"". A BT spokesman said ISPs were ""unlikely to discriminate against particular traffic"" since customers could ""easily switch"" to a rival provider.But Robert Hammond, head of digital communications at Consumer Focus, warns that the internet will become ""dominated by big companies who can pay for privileged access"" if the measures outlined in the open letter aren't put in place.""The web should enable all voices to be heard equally,"" he said. ""The government suggests that consumers will be able to navigate round the restrictions a two-tier web will put in place by switching internet provider. This is wishful thinking at best. Any information on how providers prioritise different websites will be unintelligible techno-babble buried away, and in reality, will not help consumers make informed choices.""",2010-12-02T13:11:42Z,Vaizey pressed on net neutrality by internet heavyweights,,95,<p>eBbay and Skype among signatories to open letter calling for government to back promises on open internet with action</p>,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2010/11/17/1290000724195/Ed-Vaizey-002.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/dec/02/companies-press-vaizey-net-neutrality,4,neutral

"The communications minister, Ed Vaizey, has insisted to the Guardian that he is in favour of net neutrality, and that his speech on the subject has been misinterpreted.Ed Vaizey, who last week gave a speech on the internet and regulation (PDF) to an FT conference, told the Guardian that ""I say 'don't block input' [to the internet]. It's my first principle."" He added that he thought people who criticise him for abandoning net neutrality haven't read his speech: ""I say the same as Berners-Lee.""However Berners-Lee was less sure when the Guardian asked him. ""There's no passage in [Vaizey's] speech where he says he's against net neutrality,"" he said. ""We have discussed it on the phone. But I can't say yet that we're entirely in line.""The passage in Vaizey's speech which sparked controversy last week, titled ""The open internet"", was titled ""Net neutrality"", and noted that discussions on the topic have ""particular resonance"" in the US because some areas have fewer choices of ISPs and ""ISPs could have total control over which services and applications a consumer has access to, and could give preferential treatment to those they favour."" Vaizey noted that there are different discussions on the topic in other countries, including Canada, Norway and the European Union.In the key passage, he said: ""Consumers should always have the ability to access any legal content or service. Content and service providers should have the ability to innovate and, most importantly, to reach end users ... This could include the evolution of a two-sided market where consumers and content providers could choose to pay for differing levels of quality of service.""The comments sparked a furore as his words were seen as allowing a two-tier internet in which companies would have to pay to get their content to arrive in timely fashion - a complaint that Erik Huggers of the BBC made last month over the corporation's iPlayer catchup service.Berners-Lee, who has written at length on the web in the latest edition of Scientific American, previously set out his principles on net neutrality in a personal blog post in June 2006, in which he wrote that:""Net neutrality is this: If I pay to connect to the net with a certain quality of service, and you pay to connect with that or greater quality of service, then we can communicate at that level."" He continued: ""... net neutrality is not asking for the internet for free, or saying that one shouldn't pay more money for high quality of service... Freedom of connection, with any application, to any party, is the fundamental social basis of the internet, and, now, the society based on it.""The key difference is that Vaizey mentions content providers - where Berners-Lee does not. That subtle difference could leave space for ISPs to charge content providers.When challenged on this, Vaizey insisted ""but I say don't block input. It's my first principle.""Notably, Berners-Lee retweeted a link to a Guardian article in which the singer and entrepreneur Peter Gabriel insisted on the importance of net neutrality. But he told the Guardian afterwards that he had discussed the topic with Vaizey.In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Vaizey reiterated that ""My first and overriding priority is an open internet where consumers have access to all legal content. Should the internet develop in a way that was detrimental to consumer interests we would seek to intervene.""He added: ""We're not saying one ISP should be able to prioritise one provider's content over another and I don't support the commercial decision to downgrade a rival's site.""",2010-11-22T06:49:11Z,Vaizey insists he favours net neutrality – and agrees with Berners-Lee,,97,<p>Minister insists his speech has been misinterpreted - but web inventor shies away from claim that the two are entirely in line over ISP behaviour</p>,,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/nov/22/vaizey-net-neutrality-berners-lee,4,negative
"The UK government's plans to abandon net neutrality threaten British business startups and if taken up elsewhere could undermine democracy, says Peter Gabriel, the influential musician and technology entrepreneur who has backed a number of successful internet companies.""I feel very strongly about it,"" said Gabriel, who has invested in a number of companies, including Bath-based The Filter and On Demand Distribution (OD2). ""Freedom of access [to information online] is going to be an important battleground. It's vital to a free and open democracy: [net neutrality] serves everybody.""The communications minister Ed Vaizey said in a speech on Wednesday that internet service providers would be allowed to discriminate in favour of one content provider over another in order to manage internet traffic as long as they informed customers what they were doing. He said a lightly regulated internet was ""good for business, good for the economy and good for people"".But Gabriel, and David Maher Roberts, chief executive of The Filter – the Bath-based company which has sold its recommendation system to a number of companies including Nokia and NBC – said that such a move would potentially undermine new businesses and users' access to information.""From our point of view net neutrality makes things accessible,"" said Maher Roberts. ""That plays into the ubiquity of content, and that makes everything more relevant to me. If users only have access to what their ISP allows through, that's not good from a business perspective. You've got to allow startups to deliver next-generation tools.""Gabriel sees the abandonment of net neutrality as a dangerous precedent when governments around the world are trying to stifle the free flow of information as the internet reaches further and further. ""The pace of technological change means there's a battle for the internet,"" he said. ""It used to be a free and open zone. Now there are governments around the world, especially in China, spending money trying to control this beast.""Others have added their voices to calls about the importance of net neutrality elsewhere. Barry Diller, head of the US content provider IAC, said that the principle was under attack from big telecoms providers, who he said wanted to set up a ""tollbooth"" on the internet. He said that would hurt ""the little guys"" who create content: ""It seems ridiculous to charge the toaster for the electrical grid, instead of the consumer. [The ISPs and telecoms providers] want to charge both.""Vaizey's suggestions may meet other opposition. Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web who is presently advising the cabinet office on making data accessible, said in 2006 that net neutrality was a simple principle: ""If I pay to connect to the net with a certain quality of service, and you pay to connect with that or greater quality of service, then we can communicate at that level... net neutrality is not asking for the internet for free, or saying that one shouldn't pay more money for high quality of service... Freedom of connection, with any application, to any party, is the fundamental social basis of the internet, and, now, the society based on it.""The proposals have been opposed by the BBC's Erik Huggers, who said last month that ""This innovative and dynamic ecosystem, that enables huge public value, could be put at risk if network operators are allowed to use traffic management to become gatekeepers to the internet.""",2010-11-18T12:36:57Z,Peter Gabriel joins voices backing net neutrality in UK,,98,<p>Musician and technology entrepreneur criticises Ed Vaizey proposals to let ISPs charge content providers individually</p>,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2010/6/2/1275499849566/Peter-Gabriel-002.jpg,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/nov/18/peter-gabriel-net-neutrality-backing,4,positive
"BT, TalkTalk, Sky and other internet providers will be allowed to create a ""two-speed"" internet – favouring broadcasters and other media companies who pay them extra for a faster service – under proposals put forward by communications minister Ed Vaizey today.The move prompted immediate concern from the BBC, which fears that its popular but traffic-hungry iPlayer service could be relegated to an ""internet slow lane"", while rivals spend large sums with the likes of BT to ensure faster online transmission to the nation's homes.Vaizey, speaking at a conference in London, said it was a ""crucial stage in the history of the internet"". He added it was necessary to allow broadband providers ""to shape"" how services such as the BBC iPlayer are delivered as demand for watching online video takes off and consumes more internet capacity.However, Erik Huggers, the BBC's director of future media and technology, said afterwards that he was concerned by the plans. It was ""critical"" that access to all internet services was equal. BBC insiders fear that the internet providers will try to charge the corporation considerable sums to ensure EastEnders and other popular programmes are delivered smoothly.Ministers, though, want regulations to ensure that consumers are informed as to what their internet provider is doing. Vaizey said that the new rules would require providers to ""present information about their service, including the nature and extent of their traffic management policies and their impact on service quality in a clear, visible and easy to understand form"".In the past, internet providers have treated all data equally – a concept known as net neutrality – which means that all content, whether video from the BBC or a pirated song, will travel across the network under the same rules. But BT and Talk Talk, in particular, want to charge heavy users extra to ensure their content is delivered more quickly and reliably. Ofcom and the European commission are holding a joint consultation on the subject, which is due to report early next year.The debate has already proved controversial. While BT and Talk Talk claim that the BBC's iPlayer and Google's YouTube account for a high proportion of their traffic, companies such as Google have warned that if internet providers are allowed to discriminate it would stifle online innovation and freedom of expression.""Maintaining an open and neutral internet is critical,"" Huggers said in a keynote speech. ""I am concerned by recent developments whereby ISPs discriminate in favour of certain traffic based on who provides it. An open and neutral internet is crucial to the growth of our digital economy.""BT welcomed the announcement, saying broadband providers ""should be free to strike commercial deals"" with content providers who want ""a higher quality of service delivery"". A BT spokesman said ISPs were ""unlikely to discriminate against particular traffic"" since customers could ""easily switch"" to a rival provider.But consumer rights groups argue that such a move would still restrict the choice of most internet users.

"Internet service providers such as BT should be allowed to abandon net neutrality and prioritise users' access to certain content providers, the communications minister Ed Vaizey said in a speech today.The move away from net neutrality in the UK will prove controversial as it opens the door for ISPs to favour some websites in terms of the volume and speed of the delivery of their content to users, while others given lower priority could see their internet traffic suffer.Both Google and the BBC have warned against allowing ISPs to discriminate in their delivery of content in recent months, saying that such moves would stifle online innovation. Abandoning the so-called ""net neutrality"" principle that all internet traffic – content, platforms and websites – should be treated equally would harm growth of the medium, the companies warned.Ditching net neutrality could lead to websites paying ISPs to ensure their content gets priority.Vaizey today said ISPs should be free to favour one content provider over another as long as they inform customers in order to manage internet traffic.""Under the new provisions providers must present information about their service, including the nature and extent of their traffic management policies and their impact on service quality in a clear, visible and easy to understand form for all their customers,"" Vaizey told a telecoms conference hosted by the Financial Times in London.He said a lightly regulated internet was ""good for business, good for the economy and good for people"". ""Consumers should have the ability to access any legal content or service. Content and service providers should have the ability to innovate and, most importantly, to reach users,"" Vaizey added.Last month Erik Huggers, the BBC director of future media and technology, warned against abandoning net neutrality in the corporation's submission to a consultation on the issue being conducted by Ofcom and the European Commission.""An emerging trend towards network operators discriminating in favour of certain traffic based on who provides it, as part of commercial arrangements, is a worrying development,"" Huggers wrote on the corporation's BBC Internet blog.""This innovative and dynamic ecosystem, that enables huge public value, could be put at risk if network operators are allowed to use traffic management to become gatekeepers to the internet.""Vaizey today said that early responses to Ofcom's consultation showed there was ""broad agreement on the need for traffic management"".He added ""there is not yet evidence of any impact either on competition or consumers from traffic management"".""We are still at an early stage here. Such impacts and harms could arise in the future, and greater transparency is required to combat this,"" Vaizey said.Jim Killock, executive director of the campaigning organisation Open Rights Group, today warned: ""Removing net neutrality is likely to reduce innovation and reduce people's ability to exercise their freedom of speech.""ORG will campaign against any market abuse, if companies like BT, Sky and Virgin restrict customer's internet access for market advantage.""",2010-11-17T13:35:53Z,"ISPs should be free to abandon net neutrality, says Ed Vaizey",,100,"<p>Minister says internet should be lightly regulated, with network operators allowed to favour one content provider over another.
