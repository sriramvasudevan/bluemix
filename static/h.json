        "body": "A new paper published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters by Griffin &amp; Anchukaitis concludes that the 2012\u20132014 drought in California was its most intense in at least 1,200 years. The study used drought reconstructions from tree-ring cores, from the North American Drought Atlas (NADA) and from cores Griffin &amp; Anchukaitis collected from blue oak trees in southern and central California. Blue oak tree ring widths are particularly sensitive to moisture changes. According to Griffin,  California\u2019s old blue oaks are as close to nature\u2019s rain gauges as we get      Pencil-like tree-ring cores are collected non-destructively using a Swedish increment borer.

The study compared today\u2019s drought conditions in California to those reconstructed over the past 1,200 years using the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), an estimate of available soil moisture. The data showed that California is experiencing its most intense drought in over a millennium,  the current event is the most severe drought in the last 1200 years, with single year (2014) and accumulated moisture deficits worse than any previous continuous span of dry years \u2026 In terms of cumulative severity, it is the worst drought on record (-14.55 cumulative PDSI), more extreme than longer (4- to 9-year) droughts.

What\u2019s interesting is that the blue oak data showed that while precipitation levels in California have been low over the past 3 years, the levels haven\u2019t been unprecedented.

Photograph: Geophysical Research Letters.    But at the same time as California has been getting little rain, it\u2019s also experienced record hot temperatures. It\u2019s the heat that\u2019s pushed the drought into unprecedented territory. Griffin &amp; Anchukaitis concluded,  temperature could have exacerbated the 2014 drought by approximately 36% \u2026 These observations from the paleoclimate record suggest that high temperatures have combined with the low but not yet exceptional precipitation deficits to create the worst short-term drought of the last millennium for the state of California \u2026 Future severe droughts are expected to be in part driven by anthropogenic influences and temperatures outside the range of the last millennium.  Another new paper also published in Geophysical Research Letters by scientists at the University of California, Irvine likewise recognizes the extreme and unprecedented nature of California\u2019s current drought, and focuses on the risks that these events pose in the present and future.  Despite the well-recognized interdependence between temperature and precipitation \u2026 little attention has been paid to risk analysis of concurrent extreme droughts and heatwaves \u2026 We argue that the global warming and the associated increase in extreme temperatures substantially increase the chance of concurrent droughts and heatwaves.  As the authors note, at issue is the fact that humans are causing temperatures to rise. Thus although droughts will always happen naturally, as studies have shown, they\u2019ll become more intense in a warmer world. The combination of dry, hot weather will create bigger risks for Californians. The human connection to the California drought Climate scientist Michael Mann nicely summarized the ways that humans may have contributed to the current California drought,  In fact, there are at least three different mechanisms that are potentially relevant to the connection between the 2013/2014 California drought and human-caused climate change.  There is (1) the impact of climate change on the pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) off the west coast. One recent study suggests that climate change favors an SST pattern in the North Pacific that increases the incidence of the atmospheric circulation pattern responsible for the current drought.  Then there is (2) the marked decrease in Arctic Sea Ice due to global warming. Studies going back more than a decade show that reduced Arctic sea ice may also favor such an atmospheric circulation pattern. More recent work by Jennifer Francis of Rutgers provides independent support for that mechanism.  Finally, there is (3) the effect of global warming on soil moisture. All other things being equal, warming of soils leads to greater rates of evaporation and drying. This mechanism leads to worsened drought even if rainfall patterns are unchanged.  There\u2019s been some confusion about the human influence on the drought because two studies published this year didn\u2019t find a connection to the lack of rainfall. However, as Mann noted, those studies did not consider the three mechanisms listed above. They were incomplete. On the other hand, two other studies that considered the first factor did find a connection. A high pressure ridge sitting of California\u2019s coast for several years (known as the \u201cRidiculously Resilient Ridge\u201d for its persistence) has been a primary factor contributing to the low levels of precipitation. The ridge has pushed storms north of California, leaving the state dry. A study led by Noah Diffenbaugh at Stanford used modeling and statistics to find that these sorts of persistent high-pressure ridges are more likely to sit off California\u2019s coast in the presence of high levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Another paper published this year by Simon Wang and colleagues similarly concluded that human-caused global warming is changing conditions in the Pacific Ocean that make these high-pressure ridges off the coast stronger, thus intensifying droughts in California. In short, it appears that humans are contributing to the strength of high pressure ridges off California\u2019s coast, which will tend to reduce the amount of precipitation in the state. High temperatures exacerbate these dry conditions by increasing evaporation, soil dryness, and water demand. According to Griffin &amp; Anchukaitis, the record heat intensified the drought by about 36%, leading to exceptional drought conditions unprecedented in the past 1,200 years. The drought alone is anticipated to cost California over $2 billion this year. On top of that, heat and drought also create conditions ripe for wildfires; another major problem for California. As expected, California also saw an intense wildfire season in 2014, blowing well through its firefighting budget. Now that the state is finally seeing some significant rainfall in December, those wildfires created conditions conducive to flooding and mudslides. As a major agricultural producer, this extreme weather in California impacts the entire country and world. However, it\u2019s also giving us a glimpse at the risks we all face if we fail to curb global warming. Heatwaves, droughts, floods, wildfires, and other types of extreme weather are becoming more intense due to human-caused global warming. The longer we wait to cut carbon pollution and slow global warming, the more extreme our weather and its impacts will become.",

        "body": "California is in the midst of its worst drought in over 1,200 years, exacerbated by record hot temperatures. A new study led by Benjamin Cook at Nasa GISS examines how drought intensity in North America will change in a hotter world, and finds that things will only get worse. Global warming intensifies drought in several ways. In increases evaporation from soil and reservoirs. In increases water demand. It makes precipitation fall more as rain and less as snow, which is problematic for regions like California that rely on snowpack melt to refill reservoirs throughout the year. It also makes the snowpack melt earlier in the year. The record heat has intensified the current California drought by about 36%, and the planet will only continue to get hotter.         NASA scientists used tree rings to understand past droughts and climate models incorporating soil moisture data to estimate future drought risk in the 21st century.    The study finds that drought intensity will increase, but could be manageable if we follow a path that involves slowing global warming by cutting carbon pollution.     Soil moisture 30 cm below ground projected through 2100 for scenario RCP 4.5, which involves action to reduce carbon pollution. Brown is drier and blue is wetter than the 20th century average. Source: NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center    However, decades-long mega-droughts in North America could be much worse than those experienced during medieval times, which led to the decline of native populations, if we continue on our current business-as-usual path.     Soil moisture 30 cm below ground projected through 2100 for scenario RCP 8.5, which involves business-as-usual high levels of carbon pollution. Brown is drier and blue is wetter than the 20th century average. Source: NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center    Jason Smerdon, a co-author and climate scientist at Columbia University\u2019s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, described the implications of the study in stark terms,  The 21st-century projections make the [previous] mega-droughts seem like quaint walks through the garden of Eden   The mega-droughts are projected to hit the main agricultural regions in the United States \u2013 both California and the Midwest \u201cbreadbasket.\u201d The chronic water shortages that are anticipated in these regions under the business-as-usual scenario would make farming, as well as ranching in the American southwest, nearly impossible. This study reveals the flaw that underlies the \u2018CO2 is plant food\u2019 myth. While some types of plants benefit from a high-CO2 environment in a greenhouse where we can control all other variables, in the global climate, carbon pollution has other consequences. Among these are higher temperatures and more intense droughts, which are not good for plants or agriculture. It\u2019s another example of the risks we face in a hotter world. This is an important time in human history, where we\u2019re at a fork in the road. If we follow the business-as-usual path, we move towards a future with extremely disruptive climate consequences, like mega-droughts and water shortages in major agricultural regions. If we follow the path to cut carbon pollution, we significantly reduce the risks of disruptive climate change.",

        "body": "The prolonged and devastating drought that sparked the mass migration of rural workers into Syrian cities before the 2011 uprising was probably made worse by greenhouse gas emissions, US scientists say. The study is one of the first to implicate global warming from human activities as one of the factors that played into the Syrian conflict which is estimated to have claimed more than 190,000 lives. The severity of the 2006 to 2010 drought, and more importantly the failure of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime to prepare, or respond to it effectively, exacerbated other tensions, from unemployment to corruption and inequality, which erupted in the wake of the Arab spring revolutions, the scientists say.  \u201cWe\u2019re not arguing that the drought, or even human-induced climate change, caused the uprising,\u201d said Colin Kelley at the University of California in Santa Barbara. \u201cWhat we are saying is that the long term trend, of less rainfall and warmer temperatures in the region, was a contributing factor, because it made the drought so much more severe.\u201d  From 2006, the Fertile Crescent, where farming was born 12,000 years ago, faced the worst three year drought in the instrumental record. Unsustainable agricultural policies meant that the drought led to the broad collapse of farming in northeastern Syria. Their livelihoods gone, an estimated one to 1.5 million people surged into the cities. The arrival of so many rural families came on the heels of a million Iraqi refugees who arrived after 2006, causing what Kelley refers to as a \u201chuge population shock\u201d in Syria\u2019s most affected urban centres. Many of the displaced settled on the edges of cities, where already tough living conditions were made more challenging by poor access to water and electricity. Writing in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Kelley describes how the unsustainable farming practices in Syria led to a massive depletion of groundwater which was crucial for irrigating land beyond the reaches of the rivers.  But the dwindling groundwater was accompanied by a long term decline in rainfall in the region that affected farms watered from rivers. According to records Kelley studied, the Fertile Crescent, including Syria, witnessed a 13% drop in its winter rainfall since 1931. Another trend saw summer temperatures rising, which dried out much of the remaining moisture in the soils. To explore the causes of the drought, the US scientists turned to climate change models. They found that the models predicted the drier and warmer trend for Syria, but only when they included human greenhouse gas emissions. The trend made such a severe drought in Syria more than twice as likely, they report. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong argument to be made that the long term trend contributed to this drought and was the reason it was the most severe drought they have ever had,\u201d Kelley said. The theory has not convinced everyone though. Francesca de Ch\u00e2tel at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, points out that rural communities had been left disenfranchised and disaffected from 50 years of policies that exploited and mismanaged Syrian resources.  In the journal Middle Eastern Studies last year, she wrote that the government\u2019s failure to respond to the drought crisis was only one of the triggers of the protests that started in March 2011, along with a host of other political, economic and social grievances. \u201cThe uprising has more to do with the government\u2019s failure to respond to the drought, and with broader feelings of discontent in rural areas, and the growing gap between rich and poor, and urban and rural areas during the 2000s, than with the drought itself,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cI don\u2019t think the uprising would have started in Syria if other countries in the region hadn\u2019t set the example,\u201d she added. \u201cI also don\u2019t think the movement would have persisted without input and support from organised groups in Syria who had been planning for this moment for years and certainly since before 2006 or the start of the drought.\u201d  The US researchers agree that civil unrest never has a simple or unique cause, and that the civil war in Syria is no exception. But they warn that global warming is predicted to bring more severe climate events, and that some could hit countries where they could spark unrest. Kelley\u2019s latest work suggests that Yemen could face its own problems with reduced rainfall in coming years. \u201cThis is an example of the emergence of climate change beginning to influence countries in a negative way. And if it continues, we\u2019ll see more examples of that in the future,\u201d he said.",

Difficult decisions are being made about what crops get priority water and how best to save fish.\u201d According to the Washington state department of agriculture, about $1.2bn of crops could be lost as a result of the drought this year.  \u201cThe drought is unlike any we\u2019ve ever experienced,\u201d said Maia Bellon, director of the state department of ecology. \u201cRain amounts have been normal but snow has been scarce.

The 21st-century projections make the [previous] mega-droughts seem like quaint walks through the garden of Eden  Climate scientist Jason Smerdon     At the beginning of the month, the Natural Resources Conservation Service found that of 98 snow sites measured in Washington, 66 were snow-free, 11 for the first time ever. According to Inslee\u2019s office, snowpack in Washington\u2019s mountains has dropped to just 16% of normal levels.  In California, snow on the mountains has fallen to 12% of average levels, from 28% last year. Snowmelt normally keeps the rivers running \u2013 in April, the US Geological Survey found that 78% of streams in Washington state were running below normal. As a result, the state\u2019s department of natural resources expects more early-season and higher-elevation wildfires.   \u201cWe have some tough, challenging months ahead of us,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to bring support and relief to the hardest hit areas of the state. We\u2019re going to do everything we can to get through this.\u201d  About 2.47 million people living in Washington are affected by the drought, according to the information released on Tuesday by the US Drought Monitor.

        "body": "A global weather phenomenon could cause a famine in the Sahel this year by combining with already dry conditions to create a \u201cdouble whammy\u201d for the region, scientists and aid groups have warned. Professor Adam Scaife, a long term forecaster at the UK Met Office Hadley Centre, said models now agreed an El Ni\u00f1o event was likely and the first impacts may be felt as early as June. El Ni\u00f1o is caused by a reversal of trade winds in the Pacific that allow warm water to spread east, across the ocean. The two to seven year cycle plays havoc with weather across the world.  \u201c[A] place that\u2019s really important to stress is west Africa, where there is increased risk of drought during El Ni\u00f1o. That is exacerbated this year by some conditions [including] cooling of the North Atlantic,\u201d he said.       In west Africa, Scaife said conditions were aligning in a similar way to the massive 1972 drought that devastated the Sahel with famine. During this event, drying from El Ni\u00f1o tipped the region into full blown drought.  Scaife said the current parched conditions combined with further warming and drying from El Ni\u00f1o would be a \u201cdouble whammy\u201d. Oxfam\u2019s west Africa regional director Aboubacry Tall said the partial failure of the 2014 rainy season had left between 300,000 and 400,000 people in the Sahel without access to a secure food supply.       Speaking to the Guardian from Sierra Leone, Tall said the first rains of 2015 began to fall just a few days ago and Met Office predictions of a drought as early as June were deeply concerning for people awaiting crop-growing rain in the sub-Saharan areas of northern Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Mali, northern Senegal and Mauritania. \u201cIf this rainy season is disrupted then the consequences would be quite drastic because even this year we have some gaps. If you have a second generalised failure of crops across the region you will certainly have the early set in of a food crisis or possibly a famine in the Sahel,\u201d he said.  On Wednesday, US president Barack Obama linked the violence and terror being wrought in Nigeria by Boko Haram to severe drought in the Sahel. It has been reported that young men have joined the al-Qaeda affiliated group after being displaced by food shortages. In the neighbouring coastal countries mounting a fragile recovery from ebola, Scaife said the effect of a possible El Ni\u00f1o was less clear. These areas are traditionally wetter and are more resistant to fluctuations in rainfall. \u201cIf anything it is more likely wetter on the Guinea coastline,\u201d he said. This news will come as a relief in countries where people have been driven from their farms and food production has dropped significantly. \u201cIf El Ni\u00f1o was to [cause drought] on top of Ebola in affected countries it would certainly be a significant catastrophe in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. It would put back any hope of recovery by at least another year,\u201d said Tall. Apart from Africa, El Ni\u00f1o could also bring dry conditions could in Australia and India during the next few months. In California, wet conditions could put an end to the state\u2019s worst drought in 1200 years. In 2014 many forecasters predicted an El Ni\u00f1o but it never materialised. Scaife said the Met Office modelling did not give the false alarm that led other agencies to make the wrong call. \u201cThere was not unanimous agreement that the risk was increased. This year is different. All of the forecast systems that I\u2019ve looked at show a clear increase in risk of at least a moderate El Ni\u00f1o event,\u201d he said. Earlier this month the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared an El Ni\u00f1o. In the past week a strong pulse of eastward winds has emerged in the west Pacific. \u201cIf anything that\u2019s going to strengthen it even further,\u201d said Scaife. Professor Eric Guilyardi, from Reading University\u2019s National Centre for Atmospheric Science said the current levels of warming in the Pacific were higher than before the largest recorded El Ni\u00f1o in 1997-98, although this does not guarantee an extreme event. \u201c[An extreme event] is not the most likely outcome but the risk is increased,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is specific this year is the level of warming at this time of the year is pretty high. We have to go back to 1987 to see such levels of warming at this time of the year,\u201d said Guilyardi. El Ni\u00f1os are known to temporarily raise the global temperature. Last year was the hottest on record. The global surface temperature was 0.57C above average, despite the aborted El Ni\u00f1o.

        "body": "It is hard to imagine, but the flash floods and thunderstorms that took more than two dozen lives over the last week in Texas and Oklahoma, and washed away hundreds of homes, could provide good news for drought-stricken California. A developing El Ni\u00f1o weather event in the Pacific Ocean that can be linked to the deadly downpours in Oklahoma and Texas may be getting stronger, meteorologists say. A strong El Ni\u00f1o in the late fall and early winter tends to be associated with wetter winters in California. \u201cThere is evidence, if you look back at past El Ni\u00f1o events,\u201d said Tim DiLiberto, a meteorologist with the NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center, \u201cthat if you have a strong El Ni\u00f1o, it is usually associated with rainfall in California.\u201d California entered its fourth year of drought this year, with Governor Jerry Brown announcing unprecedented state-imposed water reductions. Texas and Oklahoma, meanwhile, saw a five-year drought come to an end this month with the arrival of thunderstorms, tornadoes and disastrous floods.  DiLiberto warned that \u201cseasonal predictions in general are very difficult\u201d, and described the chances of a stronger El Ni\u00f1o and a wet California winter as \u201cuncertain\u201d, if still \u201cabove average\u201d. Californians, though, are eager for good news. The Los Angeles Times invited its readers to look east this week, towards the disaster-stricken areas of Texas and Oklahoma, precisely because of what a strong El Ni\u00f1o might mean for them. \u201cWhat this exemplifies is something that applies to climate variation in the short and long term,\u201d said Anthony Broccoli, a professor in the department of environmental sciences at Rutgers University. \u201cThat one particular pattern may produce weather conditions viewed favorably in one place and less favorably somewhere else.\u201d Broccoli called this a seesaw effect that has long occurred in the US, with mild and dry winters on the west coast sometimes meaning cold and stormy winters on the east coast.  But as the effects of global warming kick in, Broccoli said, evidence shows that already dry areas of the world \u2013 like California \u2013 will become drier. The warming of the planet was also expected to make rain events heavier, he said, with locations getting greater fractions of their total ratio of rainfall during those heavy precipitations, meaning light or moderate rain events would become rarer. As such events become more usual, the solution to ending extreme weather patterns may not lie in opposite extremes. \u201cThe ideal to end a drought are rains that cumulatively amount to a lot and are not quite as intense,\u201d Broccoli said. Heavy and intense rainfall is precisely the kind of phenomenon that caused flash floods in Oklahoma and Texas. Last week, the Weather Channel reported that a river in Blanco, Texas had risen as fast as 17ft in half an hour between Friday and Saturday, with water crushing and stripping the insides of nearby homes. A possible rainier winter in California may carry its own extreme weather events like landslides, Broccoli said. DiLiberto cautioned against perceiving El Ni\u00f1o as the answer to California\u2019s drought problem.  \u201cAny rain will help, but we are starting from a very low point. It will take a pretty substantial amount of rain to remove multiple drought years in just one year,\u201d he said, adding that the volume of rain needed to end the drought would likely have knock-on landslide effects.  Besides, El Ni\u00f1o-enhanced rain would still not help resolve the depleted snowpack in northern California, DiLiberto said. \u201cEl Ni\u00f1os don\u2019t mean bad things all the time, but sometimes it\u2019s too much of a good thing,\u201d he said.",

The storms will carry the risk of lightning and flash floods as well as heatwaves with muggy conditions, putting emergency services on alert. A strong ridge of high pressure expanding westward from Mexico, Texas and Arizona is expected to sharply increase temperatures on Wednesday through Friday and draw monsoonal moisture into the region. The rainfall will not ease the four-year-old drought, said Chris Hintz, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service (NWS) office in Sacramento. \u201cAbsolutely not. Not even close.\u201d In fact the storms will be accompanied by triple-digit temperatures and may trigger wildfires, he warned. \u201cInitially the thunderstorms will probably not produce a lot of rain. They will mainly be isolated and over the mountains. They could produce more fires because of the lightning.\u201d   Related: Wildfires torch bone-dry northern California as temperatures rise    Jan Null, a former NWS lead forecaster who now runs a consultancy, Golden Gate Weather Services, said monsoonal moisture did not signify torrential, tropical downpour. \u201cIt\u2019ll be very spotty. It won\u2019t make a dent in the drought.\u201d The heatwave began in Sacramento on Tuesday, where temperatures were expected to reach 104F (40C). They could exceed 107F later this week.  July, typically an arid month, has turned out to be one of the wettest in California history. Some of the downpours helped douse wildfires but the accompanying lightning also started about half a dozen new ones. Storms last week also caused a mud and rock slide on Highway 140 near the western edge of Yosemite park, and washed away a bridge along Interstate 10, a major freeway connecting southern California and Arizona. Damper vegetation is a mixed blessing for firefighters. It can reduce kindling-type conditions for several days but if heat returns the new, green shoots can quickly die and become fuel for a future fire. The recent downpours also wreaked havoc on power lines and rained out a Los Angeles Angels home game for the first time in two decades. Climatologists said there is an increasing chance El Ni\u00f1o, a weather phenomenon characterized by the warming of Pacific Ocean waters, will bring a wetter than average winter to California. \u201cIt\u2019s already in the Pacific, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll got a lot of rainfall. But the stronger it gets, the stronger the chance of that happening,\u201d said Null. There are indications this year\u2019s El Ni\u00f1o could be as strong as or stronger than the 1997-98 El Ni\u00f1o. Even then, busting the drought will depend on consistent rain reaching northern California, home to giant reservoirs and snowpack which supply the rest of the state.",

        "body": "Rain could come to drought-stricken California this fall, as one of the strongest El Ni\u00f1o weather patterns in recorded history looks set to hit the state, the National Weather Service (NWS) said on Thursday. The NWS\u2019s Climate Prediction Center said that current measurements were stronger than those detected ahead of the 1997 El Ni\u00f1o, which doubled rainfall in southern California. El Ni\u00f1o is a complex weather pattern resulting from variations in ocean temperatures, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But Mike Halpert, deputy director of the Climate Prediction Center, warned that even if El Ni\u00f1o did bring increased rain, the effect on the drought would be limited. \u201cOne season of above normal rain and snow is very unlikely to erase four years of drought,\u201d Halpert said. The National Weather Service measured increased temperatures in the Pacific ocean in July, which indicate \u201ca significant and strengthening El Ni\u00f1o\u201d. The 1997 El Ni\u00f1o triggered one of the most severe storm systems in the state\u2019s recent history, doubling the average rainfall from December 1997 to February 1998.  To truly benefit the state, rain and snow would need to reach northern California to fill some of the state\u2019s primary reservoirs and increase the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountains.  Kevin Werner, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s western region climate services, said that El Ni\u00f1o tends to bring above normal precipitation to southern California, but is not proven to have such effects on northern California.   Related: On the hunt for 'moral breaches' with California's foremost drought-shamer    \u201cThis is important because most of the water resources in the state originate from the much wetter mountain areas in the central and northern part of California along with the upper Colorado river basin,\u201d Werner said. While the weather system typically brings rain, it is also tied to mudslides and flooding.  The National Weather Service said that all of its models predict that the weather system will continue into spring 2016, peaking in late fall or early winter of 2015. This El Ni\u00f1o has already caused drought conditions in Australia, Indonesia and parts if the the Philippines.",

        "body": "Global warming has increased the severity of the ongoing drought in California, as part of a larger trend of human-caused climate change intensifying dry weather spells, scientists said on Thursday. Scientists predict that \u201cenhanced drought\u201d will continue in California throughout this century because global warming has \u201csubstantially increased\u201d the likelihood of extreme droughts in the state. Recent studies have looked at climate models to predict the future frequency of droughts while others have analyzed historical records to see the probability of drought. The paper published on Thursday in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, however, looks at how much of the current drought can be blamed on global warming.  Scientists looked at factors that could impact the drought, including temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed and other factors and found that climate change intensified the drought in California between 8% and 27% in the period from 2012 to 2014.  Park Williams, a climate scientist at Columbia University and the lead author of the paper, said he hoped the findings would motivate the state to continue thinking about its response to the drought with a long-term strategy. \u201cCalifornia, I believe, has a history of when droughts end, they have a history of discontinuing their efforts to improve resiliency to future drought because those efforts are costly in the short-term,\u201d Williams said.  But this strategy is not sustainable, according to the study. \u201cI hope that the measures that are under way now to improve resilience to droughts don\u2019t end as soon as it gets wet again in a few years,\u201d Williams said.  His comments are particularly prescient as California prepares for rain from the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon \u2013 which the National Weather Service said could be one of the strongest to ever hit the state. The storm system is known for bringing heavy rains to California, though it is not expected to have a significant impact on the drought.  A Public Policy Institute of California report released earlier this week cautioned that \u201cit would not be prudent to count on El Ni\u00f1o to end the drought\u201d. The report predicts that if the current drought continues, it will most acutely harm low-income rural communities and California\u2019s forests and wetlands, putting the region\u2019s biodiversity under \u201cextreme threat\u201d. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced on Thursday that July was the hottest month in history since record-keeping began in 1880. This came a month after scientists announced that the first half of 2015 was the hottest recorded.  Jessica Blunden, a Noaa climate scientist, said that heat records like this were \u201cgetting to be a monthly thing\u201d.",

        "body": "Climate change is worsening the fires that ravage many parts of America each year. Grime-streaked firefighters battling one of the 167 active wildfires currently scorching portions of the US west will tell you as much. What they have encountered on the firelines in the past few years is evidence that everything has changed as a result of global warming.  In mid-August, the day after a quick-moving fire first exploded southwest of Boise, Idaho, the blaze more than doubled in size to nearly 79,000 acres in one four hour stretch. Along the way, it sparked a \u201cfirenado\u201d that rained hot ash and dirt on firefighters.  Or consider the disturbing talk surrounding the still-smoldering fire named Rocky that this month scorched 70,000 acres near Napa, California: \u201cThis fire wants to do whatever it wants,\u201d Jason Shanley, a Cal Fire spokesman, observed, adding \u201cIt\u2019s defying all odds. 30 year, 40 year veterans have never seen this before.\u201d Last year, a raging wild land fire blasted into Yosemite National Park, propelled by a self-generated micro-climate that intensified its unpredictability. Even the idea that there is a definitive fire season has gone up in smoke. The calendar doesn\u2019t matter when flames scoot across a Colorado snowfield in December, as happened in 2012, or blacken foothills in Southern California\u2019s rainy months. But what firefighters believe is abnormal is just a new normal driven by climate change. Temperatures that spike above long-held norms, record-breaking low-humidity levels, multi-year droughts, tinder-dry vegetation and fierce winds are among the factors fueling these new, more massive infernos. The sooner that firefighting agencies, public officials, policymakers and citizens acknowledge the impact that climate change is having on the frequency, intensity, duration and behavior of fire, the sooner that they will begin to develop new responses to wildland fire in the US west.  Doing so will mean admitting that climate change is also disrupting the capacity of firefighting organizations to respond. They were created to snuff out fires based on what were perceived to be static weather patterns \u2013 the old normal.  Today\u2019s powerful conflagrations have also exposed the conceit that we must fight all fires, everywhere. That commitment is made doubly dangerous given how dried out the US west has become due to the mega-drought that has been wracking the region since 2010.   Factoring climate change into our calculations about what fires we\u2019re able and not able to fight will be a hard concession for firefighters and the public to accept. Still, we will have to let some fires burn, particularly those distant from populated areas.  Yet making such tough choices must come coupled with an increase in spending at national, state and local levels for fire-prevention measures. The US Forest Service is now spending more than 50% of its budget on firefighting alone, which is seriously undercutting its ability to conduct more cost-effective thinning of forests that can diminish a fire\u2019s intensity and speed.  More money is also needed for educational outreach to those inhabiting fire zones \u2013 dubbed the wildland-urban interface \u2013 to ensure that their dwellings are more fire safe and defensible. This investment is particularly imperative in California, where more than two million people live in these zones, putting themselves directly in the path this new fire regime.  The extreme situations wildland firefighters now regularly encounter are warning signs. How bad it gets depends on how quickly we can read and respond to them.",

As activism manager, you\u2019re tasked with championing causes Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s believes in, and tackling the problems behind climate change is part of the company\u2019s mission. How would you describe the current landscape? We\u2019re living in a spooky and troubling era where science fiction and post-apocalyptic scenarios rapidly resemble scientific facts. Early warnings of climate warming leading to extreme weather have become reality \u2013 historic droughts on four continents, heat waves and record monsoons making reliable weather a distant memory. Yet in the US, Congress has failed to produce a national policy on climate change. America lags behind other countries like Germany, where renewable energy production has tripled in the last decade.   Related: California governor calls for drastic reduction in gas emissions by 2030    Do any bright spots exist? Which regions or states are making headway? California represents the canary in the coalmine for climate change\u2019s impact in the US. California has suffered a fourth year of a record-breaking drought impacting 97% of the state \u2013 and yet this extreme weather could become the new normal. Record-breaking low snow in the Sierras creates intensifying stress across industries and communities relying on the water that is typically stored, then released from high elevations to low. Meanwhile, farmers relying on irrigation to grow most of the nation\u2019s produce face water rationing in their region, thereby reducing their output; these conditions force many to leave the state all together. Ongoing rain shortages in California have left trees dead and dry \u2013 perfect tinder for wildfires \u2013 and create divides between wealthy neighborhoods and poorer ones when communities are asked to reduce water use. Yet you believe California can lead the nation on climate change? Absolutely \u2013 even as California becomes progressively parched, the state has passed stronger policies on climate change than any other state. California is pursuing aggressive environmental goals including reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030. One of the ways California will meet this goal is through a market-based cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emissions that sets a broad set of guardrails around the energy sector, allowing companies to find the lowest cost efficiencies and technologies to reduce the state\u2019s carbon footprint.   Related: California calls on pension funds to divest from coal in climate change push    Does the system work? Yes. While cap-and-trade appears complex, the program cap now covers 85% of the state\u2019s emissions and the state has $1.6bn in the bank \u2013 paid by carbon polluters. The state applies that money towards a Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund; now $230m goes towards lower income communities suffering from the worst pollution. Most importantly, as of January 2015, emissions from capped entities are down 4%, making the state very confident it can reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 \u2013 one of its key goals.  What other positive developments do you pin your hopes on? President Barack Obama\u2019s own plan for a national carbon cap-and-trade program imploded under the weight of partisan politics. So he used his executive authority to regulate emissions reductions via the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The recently adopted Clean Power Plan tasks individual states with cutting emissions and incentivizes investment in renewable energy. Republicans and coal industry lobbyists are rattling their swords in opposition, and lawsuits are expected from coal-dependent states. California isn\u2019t the sort of state to wait and see if a partisan government can reach a compromise.

        "body": "A swathe of central Europe has suffered the most severe drought since 2003 in what EU climate experts see as a harbinger of climate changes to come. Rainless weeks and relentless heat desiccated a vast tract of central European land separating the continent\u2019s drier south from its wetter north between 1 April and 31 July, according to a report by the European drought observatory (EDO). \u201cThis is where we expect to see more extreme weather such as floods and droughts in the future, and what we are gradually starting to see in the present,\u201d said Frank Raes, the head of the climate change unit at the EU\u2019s Joint Research Centre which commissioned the report. The drought was consistent with climate models that predicted \u201can extreme weather battleground\u201d between continental weather systems in central Europe, Raes said. \u201cThe big floods and droughts of the last 20 years have been in that area,\u201d he added. Agricultural production has now slumped in large parts of a zone stretching eastwards from central France through south-central Germany into Poland, Hungary and Ukraine, and southwards into northern Italy and Spain. Grain harvests in Germany have fallen 11% and apple harvests 21% on last year\u2019s figures, while a 28% drop in corn output is expected by government officials in France. In Poland, record lows in river water levels have revealed Jewish tombstones and Soviet fighter planes, as well as human remains, buried for decades or more.   Related: Middle East faces water shortages for the next 25 years, study says    At one point, the drought reached what the German environment agency called \u201ccatastrophic proportions\u201d, with water levels on the river Elbe falling 9cm below the previous record low. At the same time, freak floods occurred in Demker, north of Magdeburg. \u201cSimilarly to the summer of 2003, a large part of the continental EU was affected by a severe drought in June and July 2015, as a consequence of the combination of rain shortages and very high temperatures which resulted in high plant water requirement levels,\u201d the EDO report said. Andreas Friedrich, a spokesman for Deutscher Wetterdienst (Germany\u2019s Met Office) agreed that the drought in Germany had been the worst for 12 years, and warned that is was not over yet. \u201cIn northern Bavaria and eastern Germany the situation is critical with an extreme drought and very high incidence of forest wildfires,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cSome parts of Germany now have the lowest levels of soil moisture since records began in 1951.\u201d Restrictions to civil and industrial water use have accompanied the water shortages, along with a drastic curtailing of inland water transportation and increases in both forest fires and energy consumption for cooling, according to the EDO report. It found that monthly rainfall averages fell by as much as 80% in parts of France, and parts of northern Spain experienced daily temperatures over 30 degrees for more than 40 consecutive days. Drought conditions did ease in August, but the European centre for medium-range weather forecasting predicts above average temperatures across the continent in September, with drier than usual conditions for most of central and northern Europe. While the UK and some parts of Europe have been relatively unaffected by the water shortages, the drought was even worse than 2003 in regions such Limousin in France, Rhine Hessen-Phalz in Germany and Oost Vlaanderen, Belgium. However, Dim Coumou, a climate modeller at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research advised caution in drawing conclusions about individual weather events. \u201cIt is too early to say how severe the current drought in Europe is,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Mediterranean is generally considered a hotspot and the models project strong increases in drought conditions there. But where exactly the [central European] belt is, I don\u2019t think can be quantified,\u201d he said.",

        "body": "The golden state\u2019s historic drought is forcing once-squeamish Californians to take a new look at \u201ctoilet-to-tap\u201d water re-use. Or as they prefer to call it in Fountain Valley, \u201cshowers to flowers\u201d. The town in conservative Orange County is home to the largest water recycling plant in the world and an example during this epic drought of the life-altering changes California will have to make to avoid running out of water. The first would be to get over the idea that water is an infinite resource, or that it pours out of the tap straight from a pristine, underground spring. This is the third year of drought in the west. By July end, more than half of California fell into the worst category of \u201cexceptional drought\u201d.  The state has made it illegal to hose down a sidewalk or operate a fountain, punishable by a $500 (\u00a3297) fine.  But those measures are largely symbolic, and the state is going to have to do much more to guarantee California a long-term supply of water. \u201cOur sources of supply are literally drying up,\u201d said Michael Markus, general manager of the Orange County water district, on a tour of the water plant.  The state\u2019s main sources of water, snow melt from the Sierra Nevada, imported water from the Colorado river, and groundwater, are all in decline. So why not re-use water? Orange County has been doing it for six years, using highly purified waste water to replenish groundwater reserves. \u201cWe consider waste water not a waste but a resource,\u201d Markus said. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have this water we wouldn\u2019t be able to pump as much out of the basin,\u201d he went on. \u201cThe basin would go into a state of overdraft.\u201d The water re-use plant currently produces 70m gallons a day, turning residential waste water \u2013 from dishwashers, showers, washing machines and toilets \u2013 into potable water.           California drought: recycling waste water to replenish ground reserves \u2013 video    In February 2015, that will rise to 100m gallons a day, as a $140m expansion comes on-line. That will be enough to supply 850,000 people, or about one-third of the 2.4 million residents of Orange County.  Markus said the cost was significantly lower than importing water from northern California, and about half the cost of desalinating sea water \u2013 and the supply was guaranteed. The water goes through three stages of purification \u2013 filtration through a series of tiny straws to remove bacteria, reverse osmosis to remove dissolved chemicals, and exposure to UV light with hydrogen peroxide. By the time it leaves the plant, it is distilled water. About half of the water is pumped into injection wells to serve as a barrier against sea water intrusion. The rest is pumped 13 miles to underground basins in Anaheim, where it filters through layers of sand and gravel, gradually becoming part of Orange County\u2019s water supply.  But it could still take some time before Californians get over their aversion to the idea of water re-use, or the notion that they can\u2019t afford to go on dumping waste water.  The state currently dumps some 1.3bn gallons of water a day into the ocean off the coast of southern California.  One of the first attempts to move to water recycling, in San Diego in the 1990s, collapsed because of what water managers call the yuck factor. Those attitudes are changing, because of the threats to existing supply. California\u2019s department of water resources reported last April that groundwater reserves had dropped 50 feet below historical lows across much of the state.     A drought-affected area near Los Altos hills, California. US farmers could lose $1.7bn because of water shortages, a study has warned. Photograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images    California law still does not allow the direct re-use of the water leaving the Orange County plant \u2013 even though it is purified to a higher standard than groundwater supplies. But the state regulator was looking to draft new rules to allow direct re-use of water by 2016. \u201cI think it is inevitable that Californians are going to have to get beyond this notion of just \u2018toilet-to-tap\u2019,\u201d said David Feldman, who teaches water management at the University of California at Irvine. \u201cI think this plant is very important to protecting the strategic reserves of water. If we did not have this groundwater basin we would have to import virtually all of our water.\u201d He said he expected to see growing water re-use in California and across the west \u2013 although not necessarily for potable water. Other water agencies in California are now actively looking at how to make best use of treated waste water, storm water and agricultural run-off, according to a research project from Stanford University. Los Angeles and San Diego are actively pursuing their own water re-use facilities. Riverside on the Santa Ana river also operates a water recycling plant that produces water for irrigation. Some 78 water projects have been funded so far, all aimed at putting water back into underground aquifers, the Water in the West researchers found. Those projects were on the drawing board before the drought \u2013 but they could help California get through the next one.",

        "body": "Grapevines march across wires strung along rolling hills, their little trunks improbably supporting heavy black fruit. Cindy Steinbeck\u2019s family has been farming this land in central California since 1920. The family grows zinfandel, viognier, cabernet, merlot and petite syrah grapes, and is best known for a blend called The Crash, named after a remarkable incident in 1956, when a B-26 crash-landed 200 yards from the family home. Four of the five Air Force men aboard survived, bailing out in the nearby fields. Now a new crash threatens, as groundwater levels beneath the vineyards plummet. Amid one of the worst droughts ever recorded \u00ad\u00ad\u2013 with more than 80% of the state in extreme or exceptional drought \u2013 Steinbeck Vineyards\u2019 520 acres of grapes have been growing well, thanks to the family\u2019s access to up to 2 acre-feet \u00ad\u2013 about 652,000 gallons \u2013 of groundwater per acre per season. The Steinbecks have been able to tap this subterranean resource at will from the Paso Robles groundwater basin because they own the land above it \u2014 and because California, which produces nearly half of US-grown fruits, nuts and vegetables, is the only western state without groundwater regulation. But that boon to farmers is also a looming disaster. Groundwater makes up a huge piece of the state\u2019s water supply, meeting approximately 40% of its water demands in an average year and 60% or more during droughts, according to the state\u2019s water resources department. And groundwater is part of a larger hydrological system: excessive groundwater pumping can empty aquifers faster than natural systems can replenish them; dry up nearby wells; allow saltwater intrusion; and draw down water supplies from rivers, lakes and streams. Taking so much water out of the soil can cause the dirt to compact and the land to sink, an action called subsidence. Land can subside as much as a foot a year in the face of aggressive pumping, destroying infrastructure such as irrigation canals, building foundations, roads, bridges and pipelines. \u201cIn the absence of governance, it\u2019s become a pumping arms race,\u201d said Felicia Marcus, chair of the State Water Resources Control Board. \u201cHe with the biggest pump or deepest straw wins.\u201d Now, California looks set to regulate groundwater for the first time. The state senate and assembly last week passed two bills, SB-1168 and AB-1739, authorizing local agencies to manage groundwater. Governor Jerry Brown has 30 days to sign the bills into law, and his approval seems likely, as he has supported the bills throughout the process.  The Association of California Water Agencies, a water-utilities trade group, and the California Water Foundation, a nonprofit focused on balancing California\u2019s water needs, support the new bills. But the California Farm Bureau Federation opposes them. Danny Merkley, director of water resources for the federation, attributed groundwater supply problems not to lack of regulation, but to \u201cinflexible, outdated environmental policies\u201d as well as population growth and climate change.  \u201cGroundwater management must protect the property rights of overlying landowners,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, there could be huge, long-term economic impacts on farms because of the potential to devalue land.\u201d Neighbors suing neighbors Even if the approved bills become law, change could come slowly. Groundwater basins would have two years to form a local management agency, five years to adopt a sustainable management plan and 20 years to achieve a sustainable supply of groundwater. It\u2019s also unclear whether the law, if approved, would help end the current spate of neighbors suing neighbors. Suing has become standard practice in California when groundwater basins are overdrafted. In these cases, a court decides who may extract how much and who will manage the basin to ensure everyone is using water according to the court\u2019s decree, a process called adjudication. The state already has 22 adjudicated groundwater basins, according to the water resources department. Adjudication can be time-consuming and expensive for all concerned. According to the San Luis Obispo County website, for example, the Santa Maria Groundwater adjudication \u201cis now going on its 12th year and is still in court appeals\u201d, with a total cost of $11m and climbing. Landowners, including Steinbeck, who have historically considered water beneath their land to be part of their property rights in California, filed suit last fall against San Luis Obispo County and four municipal water companies. This summer, this and a related lawsuit have recently been transferred to San Jose, a city to the north \u2014 because everyone agrees that locals can\u2019t be impartial. The Paso Robles groundwater basin has been declining for years, said San Luis Obispo County board of supervisors chair Bruce Gibson, but \u201cthe drought has magnified the effect.\u201d When wells began to dry up last summer, the board passed a moratorium on new water use in the basin.  While Steinbeck sees any limitation of her family\u2019s ability to pump and use the water under its land as \u201ctaking over our rights\u201d, Gibson says property rights aren\u2019t absolute. \u201cOne can do a range of activities on their property as long as it doesn\u2019t infringe on others\u2019 similar enjoyment of their property,\u201d he said.  As California assemblyman Roger Dickinson, author of the assembly bill, puts it: the property rights narrative for groundwater rights \u201cis called into question if your neighbor pumps out so much water that your well runs dry\u201d.  Part of the problem is it\u2019s unclear how much everyone is pumping: the state doesn\u2019t require groundwater supplies or pumping rates to be measured today. The recently passed bill, though, would require each groundwater basin to report everyone\u2019s pumping quantities and depth of groundwater each year, as well as to set specific objectives for stabilizing the water level at a certain elevation. As Felicia Marcus, chair of the state water board, put it: \u201cWe didn\u2019t require meters, but we\u2019re requiring the adequate ability to monitor.\u201d It\u2019s a surprisingly contentious issue. The challenge to metering groundwater \u201cis not technological; it\u2019s political\u201d, said Peter Gleick, cofounder of the Pacific Institute, an independent research organization focused on water issues. \u201cThere are certain people who benefit enormously from a lack of information and inefficiency \u2013 and those people have lawyers.\u201d How did we get here? The current groundwater crisis is part of a bigger problem. The state\u2019s existing water laws \u201cwere never designed to deal with the challenges California now faces,\u201d said Mike Young, who holds a research chair in water and environmental policy at the University of Adelaide in Australia.  Young speaks from experience. He played a key role in developing improved water entitlement, allocation and trading systems in Australia and won a national award for his efforts. Ultimately, he said, California needs that type of radical reform.  For one thing, like many places experiencing water stress around the world, California is using water inefficiently. \u201cWe really need to think about the demand side of the equation more than the supply side,\u201d Gleick said. Opacity of water rights, unmeasured usage and laws with perverse incentives enable waste. California\u2019s water rights laws are based on seniority, and in many years, there are more rights to water than actual water. \u201cThere are a lot of water claims out there and we don\u2019t have a fully adjudicated system,\u201d Marcus said. In fact, the state has allocated five times more surface water than the state actually has, according to a new University of California at Davis report. It\u2019s unclear how much water some rights holders can take out, said Brian Gray, a law professor at the University of California at Hastings. For example, the most senior water rights \u2013 called riparian \u2013 are \u201cnot quantified\u201d, he said. Also, the law has long encouraged waste. It requires water to be put to \u201creasonable and beneficial use\u201d, which includes supplying cities, industry, irrigation, hydroelectric generation, livestock watering, recreation, and fish and wildlife habitat. \u201cReasonable use\u201d sounds \u2026 well, reasonable, but a \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d clause incentivizes profligate use: if you don\u2019t use your historic water allocation in a beneficial way, you forfeit your water rights, Gray said. In addition, today farmers aren\u2019t able to sell the water they don\u2019t use or save the unused water for next year, said Thad Bettner, general manager of the Glenn Colusa Irrigation District. \u201cWe use what we can use and that\u2019s it,\u201d he said.  That\u2019s ridiculous, Young said, adding that farmers should be rewarded \u2013 not penalized \u2013 for conservation.  Courts also should adjudicate the basins and convert all of the water rights into shares, eliminating the problem of overdrafting a watershed, he said. \u201cYou cannot give anybody a guaranteed volume,\u201d he said. The future\u2019s at stake Getting groundwater policy right will become increasingly important as climate change advances, potentially reducing snowpack \u2013 which has acted as a handy storehouse in California, holding winter water and releasing it slowly into summer \u2013 by 70% to 90% (pdf). More reservoirs, which the Farm Bureau advocates, won\u2019t be enough to make up the loss, Marcus said, adding the biggest opportunity for new storage is groundwater basins, she said. The goal of the new bills is not to just stop groundwater depletion, but to create incentives to replenish these underground basins and keep them full as a water management tool. If we use groundwater basins intelligently, we can make up for snowpack by getting our act together now, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the state\u2019s future at stake.\u201d This is a condensed version of an article produced by Climate Confidential and released for re-use under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

        "body": "Esidronio Arreola never gave much thought to the well that so reliably pumped water to his traditional clapboard house in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas. But one day in March, he opened the tap and all he got was air. Through the searing summer heat, the Mexican immigrant to California\u2019s Central Valley and his family endured a daily routine of collecting water in his pickup truck from an emergency communal tank, washing from buckets and struggling to keep their withering orchard alive while they waited for snow to return to the mountains and begin the cycle of replenishing the aquifer that provides water to almost all the homes in the region. But as more of Arreola\u2019s neighbours in East Porterville, a ramshackle, low-income town in sprawling Tulare County, reported their wells running dry, and state officials warned that the most severe drought in living memory may well extend into 2015 and beyond, he realised he might not have water for years to come. So Arreola, who makes his living dealing in old fridges and washing machines from his garage, bit the bullet and borrowed the lion\u2019s share of the $11,000 it cost to drill a new well four times as deep as his old one. In mid-November, seven months after the pipes went dry, water began flowing to his taps again. Arreola just doesn\u2019t know for how long. Yet for all the difficulties, he considers himself fortunate. \u201cWe\u2019re among the lucky ones. It\u2019s weird to say that, but our old well was shallow and ran dry early \u2013 so, once we decided, we only had to wait a month for them to start drilling a new one. Now the waiting list is a year and I hear the price has gone to $17,000,\u201d he says.\u201cThere are a lot of people who cannot afford a new well. Even if you drill one, you don\u2019t know how long it will last.\u201d     Spray fan: Daniel Arreola and his father Esidronio use their new well after not having running water for over six months.

It was a humbling experience. You figure you\u2019re here in California, which is a rich state in a developed country, but you turn on the water and it comes out in drips.\u201d The only supply for Kemper and his eight children through a scorching summer was bottled water delivered by the county\u2019s emergency office. \u201cWe used that for bathing. We used it for washing our clothes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really made you manage your life differently. It changed how we think about water. You appreciate just how precious water is in our lives.\u201d Eight decades ago, the worst drought in living memory helped drive hundreds of thousands of people from Oklahoma\u2019s Dust Bowl to central California in search of work and a future toiling on the fruit farms that fill the San valley. It\u2019s a part of the American epic immortalised in John Steinbeck\u2019s bitter novel, The Grapes of Wrath. In time, many of the \u201cOkies\u201d were replaced by Mexican migrant workers as the Central Valley farms grew to produce up to half of the US\u2019s fruit, nuts and vegetables. But now the 400-mile long agricultural basin of four million people is facing its own life-changing drought that, like the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, is hitting hardest those with the least. California\u2019s governor, Jerry Brown, declared an emergency in January as 2013 was the driest on record in the state, and this year is little better. The federal authorities say more than half of California is enduring \u201cexceptional drought\u201d \u2013 the highest category. The state\u2019s main reservoirs are at an average of only 40% of capacity.     A lot of bottle: Chris Kemper, principal of the school in Seville, which has had to rely on delivered water.  Photograph: Barry J Holmes for the Observer    At the beginning of the year, John Laird, the state\u2019s secretary for natural resources, told the US Congress in a letter that \u201cCalifornia is experiencing the worst water crisis in our modern history. We are in our third consecutive year of below-normal precipitation and this year\u2019s snowpack \u2013 on which 25 million Californians depend as the source of their water supply \u2013 currently is only 10% of what it should be. \u201cAs you know, California\u2019s climate is such that it is generally dry for almost half the year \u2013 and we rely on rain and snow during the winter season to carry us through the year,\u201d he wrote. \u201cConditions \u2013 in terms of both supply and quality \u2013 are unprecedented and serious.\u201d A recent study for the National Science Foundation, a US government agency, found that the drought is \u201cvery likely\u201d linked to climate change. The immediate cause is a region of high atmospheric pressure over the Pacific, diverting storms away from California. Known to scientists as the \u201cRidiculously Resilient Ridge\u201d, it is blamed on rising greenhouse gases and the study described its persistence and intensity as \u201cunrivalled\u201d. Other studies say California is part of a \u201cmega-drought\u201d in the western US that could stretch for decades, even if the rains return periodically. The sharp drop in water levels in rivers, canals and dams is responsible for what a University of California report called \u201cthe greatest absolute reduction in water availability for California agriculture ever seen\u201d. That has prompted farmers to seek alternative sources of irrigation for ever-more-demanding crops. Drought-resistant cotton has given way to more profitable but thirsty plants such as the massive almond farms which now grow 80% of the world\u2019s supply \u2013 farmers are now drilling under their fields to tap into aquifers. But that has only added to the pressure on groundwater already depleted by lack of snow on the mountains. As agriculture drew heavily, wells serving individual houses and small communities began to suck air. The impact in Tulare County, where some of the richest agricultural areas in the US sit alongside people with the lowest incomes, is starkly on display. There are queues at communal water tanks and the irrigated fields plump with crops abruptly give way to hard-baked soil forced to sit fallow.     \u2018We bought in three truckloads of water and got rid of it in eight hours\u2019: Andrew Lockman, manager of the Office of Emergency Services for Tulare County, being interviewed. Photograph: Barry J Holmes for the Observer    Within Tulare County, where one-third of the population lives below the poverty line, nowhere is harder hit than East Porterville \u2013 a community of about 7,400 people. More than half of homes are now without running water and many of the remainder wonder how long their wells will last. \u201cBack in January, the county was getting these sporadic calls: \u2018Hey, my well\u2019s gone dry,\u2019\u201d says Andrew Lockman, head of Tulare County\u2019s Office of Emergency Services, who is in charge of relief efforts. \u201cBy June, there were over 800 households with dry wells. In East Porterville, we brought in three full truckloads of bottled water \u2013 15,552 gallons of drinking water \u2013 and we got rid of all of it in about eight hours.\u201d Lockman installed a 5,000-gallon tank in front of the fire station with a motorised pump. A steady stream of residents make the daily journey to fill buckets and drums. Houses without running water \u2013 mostly small, low-slung bungalows on plots marked out by wire fences \u2013 are often signalled by large blue storage barrels. Many of the houses are wood with corrugated iron roofs that drive people outdoors in the scorching midday heat. The sun has drained colour from their walls and paint is luxury for families struggling to pay for utilities. If there are gardens at all, and mostly there is only bone-dry dirt, they have withered for want of water. No one is going to waste it on grass, although some, like Arreola, are trying to save sources of food. He\u2019s been using waste water to keep alive a small orchard of kiwi fruits, and lemon, apple and cherry trees. There has been no fruit this year but the vines have survived. If the drought has taken a physical toll it doesn\u2019t seem to show on faces already weathered by years in the fields. Some seem to shrug off the added hardship as just another price of poverty. Lockman has been struck by the stoicism of people. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of neighbour helping neighbour,\u201d he says. \u201cWe see a lot of folks in East Porterville who say, \u2018You\u2019re out of water, hook up to mine,\u2019 knowing full well that theirs is low and then theirs goes out. Choosing to help their neighbours to their own detriment over time is pretty refreshing to see.\u201d For all that, some residents in low-income communities feel shunned by more affluent towns close by. The city of Porterville has for years resisted incorporating East Porterville into its municipality, and hooking it up to a reliable water system, out of a suspicion that it would drag down property values. And as grateful as residents are for the assistance they receive, there is worried talk in some low-income communities that people could lose their homes because of regulations requiring houses to have running water. Steve Worthley, a member of Tulare County\u2019s council, the Board of Supervisors, is aware of the concern but does not entirely allay fears. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing that and we have no desire to, but as a long-term situation, people cannot live in a home without water,\u201d he says. With winter setting in, Lockman decided it was too much to ask people to wash in buckets, so in mid-November he moved in two articulated lorries with shower stalls. Some residents had already taken to using the showers at a camp site at a neighbouring artificial lake.     Success Lake: fishing well below the usual shoreline. Photograph: Barry J Holmes for the Observer    Water levels have fallen so far that much of Success Lake\u2019s 150ft-high dam is visible. A road that served as a boat ramp now ends abruptly 35ft above the water. \u201cHave you seen the lake?\u201d says Katherine Hampton, sitting on the doorstep of her wood cabin home on the edge of East Porterville. A large broken window is roughly patched up with a piece of board. \u201cIt\u2019s normally so full. It\u2019s so down right now you can walk across it.\u201d Hampton, 32, has five children and is pregnant with her sixth. The drought has cost her husband, Johnathan, his job. \u201cI haven\u2019t worked in eight months,\u201d he says. \u201cI work in agriculture doing anything: transplanting trees, yard work, tilling ground. I was going around all the farms asking, and everyone was saying \u2018no\u2019. I thought maybe they had a problem with me. I went to four or five different farms in Tulare. Then I came across a big old sign: \u2018Water shortage. No jobs for farm hands.\u2019 So I came home.\u201d Hampton gets no unemployment benefit because he didn\u2019t hold a permanent job. He takes the hardships in his stride. \u201cI do anything I can do. Cleaning people\u2019s houses when they move out. There\u2019s not much work. We get by because we don\u2019t spend much,\u201d he says. He\u2019s a man of God and says the drought is part of the Lord\u2019s plan. \u201cPeople are small in their faith and bring this on themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping people start praying there\u2019ll be some water.\u201d The University of California report estimates that the drought has already cost the state\u2019s agricultural industry $1.5bn and 17,000 jobs. But the dependence of so many people in Tulare County on agriculture for a living has largely muted any criticism of farmers for drilling deeper and pumping more. \u201cPeople see farms getting water as a necessity,\u201d said Kemper. \u201cThey\u2019re more resentful of the water going to the cities than to the farmers.\u201d The drought has exacerbated a less visible but widespread issue: pollutants contaminating the underground water. Nitrates from fertilisers and septic tanks have been feeding into the groundwater for decades. A University of California study found that one in 10 people in the Central Valley are exposed to unsafe drinking water. But as water levels have fallen, the nitrates \u2013 which are dangerous to young children, nursing mothers and the elderly \u2013 have become more concentrated and the drinking water even less safe. Susana de Anda, director of the Community Water Centre in Tulare County, which campaigns for access to clean water, said more than one million people in California are drinking from contaminated supplies. \u201cMore residents are getting notifications not to drink the water because they are over the legal limit of the contaminant,\u201d she says.      Tulare\u2019s health department has issued thousands of letters to users of municipal systems warning against drinking the water, but no one knows how many individual wells are also affected because they are not tested. The situation in Seville was so bad that in 2011 it attracted the attention of a United Nations investigation into lack of access to clean water. Its report warned that what amounts to discrimination in the provision of water and sanitation in parts of the US \u201cmay intensify in the coming years with climate change and competing demands for ever scarce water resources\u201d. Earlier this year, Seville\u2019s school board became so alarmed at tests showing high levels of contamination that it decided to start buying bottled drinking water for students at a cost of $700 a month from Kemper\u2019s budget. \u201cThat\u2019s money we\u2019re spending that could buy a laptop a month for the school,\u201d he says. But the drought has, to some extent, proved fortuitous for Seville because one crisis has drawn action on another. The state and federal authorities did little over the polluted water, but once there was none at all, funds were rapidly found to drill a new well. It was built and on line within a week in August \u2013 a speed Lockman describes as unprecedented \u2013 at a cost of more than $250,000. \u201cFrankly, we kind of look at that as a silver lining of the story,\u201d says Lockman. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have all the other drought issues going on, we probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to make that happen.\u201d But Lockman says that Seville is probably not an example for a lot of other towns. For a start, it already had an established municipal water system. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of places where there\u2019s nothing around,\u201d he says. \u201cEast Porterville is probably our biggest challenge. We\u2019ve looked at putting in a new water system. It\u2019s really not viable to do, largely because that area has nitrate contamination.\u201d The crisis has forced California to think about long-term management of the ever-increasing demand for its limited water supplies. A state-wide conservation campaign has reduced water consumption in urban areas by about 10% over the past year, even if some of southern California\u2019s wealthiest residents have come under fire for continuing to water the vast lawns of their sprawling mansions as if there was no crisis. Individual cities have introduced a slew of initiatives, such as San Diego\u2019s recycling of wastewater for drinking.      In October, the governor approved new laws to regulate the use of underground water supplies for the first time in the state\u2019s history. Worthley says that should include rationing in agriculture. \u201cThere are going to be some very serious issues in agriculture about what is going to be a sustainable yield of water,\u201d he points out. \u201cMy guess is that there\u2019s going to be a monitoring of the wells to see how much they\u2019ve been taking out and a limit on how much they can remove. You\u2019re going to have to decide: how much of my land do I allow to go fallow? Do I grow a different kind of crop?\u201d Farmers are not likely to accept further restrictions without a fight. Relief programmes are in part funded by federal money and Congress in Washington is considering its own legislation to address the crisis. But California\u2019s leaders fear federal laws being used for political ends \u2013 particularly to weaken environmental standards at the behest of large agricultural corporations and some cities, which object to water being shifted from farms to fish conservation. While the severity of the drought in some ways matches that which created the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, the consequences so far are very different. For a start, it has not prompted a mass migration. Kemper came to Seville from LA because he was weary of the problems and violence of an inner-city school. Back then he wondered why modern day agricultural workers didn\u2019t follow the example of the Okies in the 1930s and go somewhere else. \u201cWhen I lived in Los Angeles and I\u2019d hear about drought I used to think, \u2018Why don\u2019t those people just move?\u2019 But living here, you see why. Where do you go? When you\u2019re a poor family, to move is very expensive. You have to have a job and most people here work in agriculture and those jobs are hard to find elsewhere,\u201d he said. In any case, a house without water is almost impossible to sell. But even in Seville, with its new well, there is a recognition that, with warnings of waves of drought to come, it is only a solution for so long as there is water under the town. \u201cIt\u2019s the future we\u2019re afraid of,\u201d says Kemper. \u201cWhat happens if this isn\u2019t the end? Life is going to change totally in our society. When water ceases, what do you do? If we don\u2019t have agriculture, we don\u2019t have anything here. If water goes, it\u2019ll turn into another wasteland.\u201d     Scorched earth: Lake Kaweah, a flood control reservoir in Tulare County, California, is now down to just 8% capacity.

        "body": "Kim Hammond does not want responsibility for her neighbours\u2019 livelihoods, or for the crops which stretch in all directions as far as the eye can see, or for the earth itself in this corner of California.  But these days, her little bungalow office in the yard of her family\u2019s drilling company can feel like Mount Olympus. \u201cIt\u2019s just way too stressful, playing God,\u201d said Hammond, a grandmother who co-owns the company and works as its secretary. \u201cEvery day we have people on the phone or here in person, pleading. It breaks your heart. But I always give it to them straight. I don\u2019t sugarcoat it.\u201d It is her job to tell farmers when \u2013 or if \u2013 a team can visit their property to drill for groundwater and make a well which can save a crop, avert bankruptcy and, perhaps, preserve a way of life.  As California faces a likely fourth year of drought, demand for drilling in the Central Valley has exploded. Hammond\u2019s company, Arthur &amp; Orum, can barely keep up: its seven rigs are working flat-out, yet a white folder with pending requests is thicker than three telephone books.  The waiting list has grown to three years, leaving many farmers to contemplate parched fields and ruin in what has been one of the world\u2019s most productive agricultural regions. It supplies half of America\u2019s fruit, nuts and vegetables. \u201cWe\u2019re overwhelmed. We\u2019re going crazy,\u201d said Hammond. \u201cEveryone is in a desperate situation. Everyone has a sad story.\u201d Arthur &amp; Orum has bought an additional rig for $1.2m, and out-of-state drillers have moved into the area. But as drills criss-cross the landscape, boring ever deeper into the earth, there is a haunting fear: what if they suck up all the groundwater? What if, one day, the water runs out? \u201cWe\u2019re having to go deeper and deeper,\u201d said Hammond. \u201cThey say we\u2019re tapping water millions of years old. That boggles the mind. I can hardly grasp it.\u201d  Meagre rain has depressed the water table so much that in some areas drills bore more than 1,500ft. Sucking up water stored long underground can cause soil to subside and collapse. In some places the land has dropped by a foot. Hydrogeologists have warned that pumping out groundwater faster than it can recharge threatens springs, streams and ecosystems.  Hammond said she was conflicted that the family business was saving some neighbours\u2019 livelihoods for now but risked long-term devastation. \u201cThey say we\u2019re cutting our own throats. I live here. I don\u2019t want to live in the desert.\u201d Sensing drama, a reality TV production company has asked the family company about doing a show. Desperate times The spectre of desertification inched closer this week. The Sierra Nevada snowpack, which supplies about a third of California\u2019s water, is paltry. The California Cooperative Snow Surveys Program found just 6.7in of snow \u2013 close to the lowest on record \u2013 at a survey spot near Echo Summit. Storms in December and February mean reservoirs hold more water than this time last year, but they remain well below average. Conservation efforts are slipping. In January urban areas used 9% less water than January 2013, far below the official target of 20%.  El Ni\u00f1o, the weather system which often douses the western US, has returned after a five-year absence but promises little relief. Mike Halpert, deputy director of the Climate Prediction Center, said in a statement it is \u201clikely too late and too weak to provide much relief for drought-stricken California\u201d. Federal officials warned last week that for a second consecutive year irrigation projects were likely to allocate zero water to Central Valley farmers without senior water rights. \u201cThis is an absolutely devastating shock,\u201d said Ryan Jacobsen, executive director for the Fresno County farm bureau. \u201cUnless things change dramatically in the next six weeks, we expect 2015 to be much worse than last year.\u201d Crisis is apparent as you drive through the valley. Many fields are fallow \u2013 some idled last year, others more recently. The earth is baked hard. Preliminary estimates suggest Fresno may have recorded its warmest-ever February, prolonging what has been dubbed the \u201ctime without winter\u201d. Roadside signs warn of the consequences. \u201cNo water = no food.\u201d \u201cFood grows where water flows.\u201d The American Meteorological Society has found no definitive link between climate change and California\u2019s drought, but a recent report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences said rising temperatures caused dry periods to overlap more often with warm periods. \u2018It\u2019s like frigging chemotherapy\u2019 Computers and state-of-the-art irrigation have not spared Shawn Coburn, 46, who owns a farm near Dos Palos, in Merced County. Last year he abandoned alfalfa and pomegranates and cut his 1,000-acre tomato crop by two-thirds. \u201cThis year I\u2019ll fallow all of it. You\u2019ll see a lot more land fallowed this year.\u201d Like many farmers, he assailed pumping restrictions aimed at protecting the delta smelt, a threatened fish, and other environmental regulations, branding them ruinous and futile. Environmentalists call them vital to the entire ecosystem. Coburn has spent almost $4m on wells but said in some areas water plumbed from ever lower depths was often laden with salt and other minerals. \u201cIt\u2019s like frigging chemotherapy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can get away with it for one year. By the third year you\u2019re basically killing the tree.\u201d Even so, many farmers see no alternative.      Clarence Freitas. Photograph: Rory Carroll for the Guardian    Clarence Freitas, 56, who owns 70 acres of almonds and grapes, watched with relief as a team from Arthur &amp; Orum drilled into his baked soil, boring through 80ft a day until reaching 440ft and an expensive, urgent replacement for his old 160ft-deep well.  \u201cMy heart hurts, my bank account hurts,\u201d he said, as muddy water gushed from pipes. Neighbours advised him to go deeper, in anticipation of the water table plunging further, but Freitas said the men in his family tended to die young \u2013 \u201cI hope it\u2019ll last 20 years and by then I\u2019ll be gone.\u201d He was not optimistic about the valley. \u201cThis could go back to being desert, the way it was before irrigation.\u201d Many farmers are descendants of migrants who fled here to escape the 1930s dust bowl, a trauma immortalised in John Steinbeck\u2019s novel The Grapes of Wrath. It could happen again, except this time in California\u2019s man-made Eden, said Matt Hammond, 51, Kim\u2019s husband, on his way to a drilling site.  \u201cThey\u2019ll keep growing crops around here until they pump the valley dry. If something doesn\u2019t change, everything will dry up and die. It won\u2019t be farmable anymore.\u201d The community had hoped for a \u201cmiracle March\u201d of bountiful rain but that seems unlikely, he said, scanning azure skies. \u201cNobody\u2019s fault but God\u2019s.\u201d",

        "body": "  Related: California farmers resign themselves to drought: 'Nobody's fault but God's'    As California experiences the fourth year of one of the most severe droughts in its history, a senior Nasa scientist has warned that the state has about one year of water left. In an LA Times editorial published last week, Nasa Jet Propulsion Laboratory senior water cycle scientist Jay Famiglietti called for a more \u201cforward-looking process\u201d to deal with the state\u2019s dwindling water supply. Famiglietti, who is also a professor at University of California at Irvine, said the state had about one year of water in reservoir storage and the backup supply, groundwater, was low. \u201cCalifornia has no contingency plan for a persistent drought like this one (let alone a 20-plus-year mega-drought), except, apparently, staying in emergency mode and praying for rain,\u201d Famiglietti wrote. \u201cIn short, we have no paddle to navigate this crisis.\u201d Nasa data shows that water storage has been in steady decline in California since at least 2002, before the drought began. Famiglietti called for specific measures to combat the crisis, including accelerated implementation of a law that requires groundwater sustainability, a state taskforce focused on long-term solutions and immediate, mandatory rationing. He also said there was a need for the public to be more involved in the issue. A Field poll released in February showed that 34% of California voters supported a mandatory rationing policy, though 94% agreed that the drought is \u201cserious\u201d. The majority of respondents \u2013 61% \u2013 favored the voluntary reductions the state currently encourages.   Keep it in the ground petition   On Tuesday, the State Water Resources Control Board is scheduled to vote on a conservation measure that would limit landscape watering, the strictest mandate directed at such water use the state has considered. \u201cOur state\u2019s water management is complex, but the technology and expertise exist to handle this harrowing future,\u201d Famiglietti said. \u201cIt will require major changes in policy and infrastructure that could take decades to identify and act upon. Today, not tomorrow, is the time to begin.\u201d Scientists are working to determine what role climate change has played in California\u2019s drought. Earlier this month, a study by Stanford researchers showed that high temperatures increase the risk of drought conditions. Last year, two research teams said in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society that they could not definitively pin the drought on climate change.  A third team, which includes a Stanford researcher from the previous study, said that rare atmospheric conditions are exacerbating the drought. ",

        "body": "  Related: California farmers resign themselves to drought: 'Nobody's fault but God's'    Spring is starting to feel a lot like summer in California, as a record-setting heat wave punishes the parched state now in its fourth year of what is said to be the worst drought in a millennium. Experts say the scorching spring days are part of a long-term warming pattern \u2013 driven largely by human activity \u2013 that is increasing the chances that future droughts will be as bad as this one. At fault is a warm and dry weather combination, which exacerbates the already dire drought conditions by drying soil, melting snow and driving up water usage. \u201cIt\u2019s like a one-two punch,\u201d said Jeanine Jones, deputy drought manager for the state Department of Water Resources (DWR). \u201cNot having enough water to fill our reservoirs and having the hot weather evaporate the little that we do have.\u201d  According to the most recent US drought report, moderately below-average precipitation, coupled with extremely above-average temperatures, has maintained or worsened drought conditions in California. The consequences have been devastating, from shriveling reservoirs to vanishing groundwater, dying crops, thinning herds and raging wildfires. California relies on a series of massive storms during the winter months to drop snow on the Cascades and Sierra Nevada mountain ranges. During the spring and summer months the snowpack, acting like a natural reservoir, melts as water demand rises. But the recent extremely warm weather has caused precipitation to fall as rain rather than snow. The effect is dramatically less snowpack melt from the state\u2019s mountain ranges, which can provide as much as a third of California\u2019s water supply. This year, the mountain runoff will likely be just a trickle. Snow on the mountains has fallen to 12% of average levels, from 28% last year. In March, data collected from parts of the Cascade and Sierra Nevada mountains indicated that some sites were for the first time snow-free by the first of the month. Jones said the 1 April snowpack measurements, which will be reported next week, are expected to be the lowest on record. \u201cThat does not at all bode well for our depleted reservoirs,\u201d Jones said. Hotter temperatures are predicted to be the new norm in California, the result of rising temperatures under climate change. This month, for the first time since record keeping began in the late 1880s, the temperature in Los Angeles peaked in the 90s fahrenheit for six consecutive days, according to the Los Angeles Times. Based on the current warming trajectory, the likelihood that low rain years will coincide with high heat years is almost a certainty. \u201cCalifornia is in a climate regime where are much more likely to get this kind of drought event again because of the role of temperature rise,\u201d said Stanford University professor Noah Diffenbaugh, who led a study examining the role of warm temperatures in California\u2019s droughts. That study, published earlier this month in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that historically, California\u2019s worst droughts occurred when conditions were both dry and warm, and that those conditions had occurred more frequently in the past two decades than in the last century. Diffenbaugh said global warming was increasing the risk that dry and warm years would coincide to almost ensure a drought similar to the present one. The researchers also found that in the early and mid-20th century, the warm and dry conditions occurred more or less independently. \u201cWe\u2019re heading into a regime where the temperature is essentially always conducive to drought,\u201d he said. With no foreseeable end to the drought in sight, policy makers at every level are scrambling to conserve the little water the state does have and avert dire predictions that the state could run out of a water soon, possibly in one year. \u201cThis is a struggle,\u201d California governor Jerry Brown said at a press conference earlier this month. \u201cSomething we\u2019re going to have to live with. For how long, we\u2019re not sure.\u201d On Friday, Brown signed into law a more-than-$1bn plan to fast-track emergency relief to drought-stricken cities and communities, including food aid and drinking water. The proposal also includes hundreds of millions of dollars to fund long-term projects, involving water recycling, conservation awareness and flood control projects. At the signing, Brown said the plan was part of a wider effort to prepare California for an \u201cuncertain future\u201d. The legislation followed action by the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) this month to pass what has been described as the most restrictive water conservation measures in state history. The plan limits the number of days residents can water their yards, and requires bars and restaurants to ask customers if they would like a glass of water before serving it. \u201cWe are not seeing the level of stepping up and ringing the alarm bells that the situation warrants,\u201d Felicia Marcus, the chairwoman of the SWRCB, said during the meeting this month. She said the measure was a first step, and that the board may consider even more stringent measures this spring.   Related: Marijuana cultivation in California is sucking streams dry, says new report    Amir AghaKouchak, an assistant professor at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Irvine, said the $1bn water spending plan included \u201cforward looking\u201d measures that would help the state prepare for future dry spells. For example, the plan aims to improve infrastructure such as the state\u2019s levees, which could help replenish underground aquifers, which have been drained by farmers drilling for groundwater to irrigate crops. But he warned that there is still a lot scientists don\u2019t know about droughts. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know a lot about how droughts develop, how they form, why they form,\u201d AghaKouchak said. \u201cIf California wants to stay at the front of this, we have to consider science, and the best science. But it requires support.\u201d AghaKouchak said investing in \u201cbasic research\u201d around water technology, water management and water harvesting could in the long-run improve strategies for responding to extreme weather. He also called for funding research to create better risk-assessment models to improve the predictability of droughts. While there are conservation and planning policies that lawmakers can take now to conserve water and prepare the state for the next extreme weather event, California\u2019s best hope lies ultimately in the willingness of the global community to confront climate change. \u201cThis drought is not a local California issue,\u201d AghaKouchak said. \u201cThis is a global issue. A single policymaker, or even all policymakers in California, alone cannot really do much about global temperature. This requires unprecedented international efforts and a truly global will to address these issues.\u201d",

        "body": "  Related: California drought water-use rules could force 36% reduction on Beverly Hills    Californians facing the prospect of endless drought, mandated cuts in water use and the browning of their summer lawns are mounting a revolt against the bottled water industry, following revelations that Nestl\u00e9 and other big companies are taking advantage of poor government oversight to deplete mountain streams and watersheds at vast profit.  An online petition urging an immediate end to Nestle\u2019s water bottling operations in the state has gathered more than 150,000 signatures, in the wake of an investigation by the San Bernardino Desert Sun that showed the company is taking water from some of California\u2019s driest areas on permits that expired as long as 27 years ago.  Last month a protest at a Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America bottling plant in Sacramento, the state capital, forced a one-day closure as protesters brandishing symbolic plastic torches and pitchforks blocked the entrances. The revelations have agencies from the California State Water Resources Control Board to the US Forest Service scrambling to justify a regulatory framework that is poorly policed and imposes almost no requirements on the big water companies to declare how much water they are taking.  Nestl\u00e9 itself insists its water use is efficient and has minimal impact on the environment \u2013 something the activists reject out of hand. \u201cWhile California is facing record drought conditions, it is unconscionable that Nestl\u00e9 would continue to bottle the state\u2019s precious water, export it and sell it for profit,\u201d says the petition, which is sponsored by the political activist organisation the Courage Campaign. While city-dwellers and tourists might not think twice before knocking back an Arrowhead \u2013 Nestl\u00e9\u2019s premier California still water brand \u2013 or a Crystal Geyser, residents near the affected springs and watersheds tend to be more vocal, because every drop Nestl\u00e9 takes is one drop less for their own use and for the local flora and fauna.  \u201cNestl\u00e9 has repeatedly ignored requests from local residents to halt its operations,\u201d said Erin Diaz of the nonprofit Corporate Accountability International, which is running a \u201cThink Outside the Bottle\u201d campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Nestl\u00e9 has no intention of voluntarily halting its dangerous water bottling practices. It\u2019s time for state water regulators to step in.\u201d Nestl\u00e9 and its competitors point out that bottled water accounts for a tiny fraction of California\u2019s overall use, particularly when compared with the state\u2019s vast agricultural infrastructure. Almond farming alone sucks down 10% of the state\u2019s water, at a rate of roughly one gallon per almond.  In an online op-ed piece addressing the company\u2019s relation to the drought, Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America president and chief executive Tim Brown wrote: \u201cWe have made investments in all five of our facilities in California to further reduce the amount of water used for bottling and non-bottling processes.  \u201cIn 2014, we invested in conservation measures, which are projected to save at least 1.4 million gallons of water in California each year.\u201d   Related: Is it fair to blame almond farmers for California\u2019s drought?    But water-bottling also carries symbolic weight because it takes a natural resource that theoretically belongs to all and turns it into a product retailing for many thousands \u2013 some studies suggest hundreds of thousands \u2013 of times what it costs at source.  Studies over the past decade and a half have challenged the claims of an industry that barely existed 25 years ago that bottled water is healthier than tap \u2013 in fact somewhere between one quarter and one half of bottled water comes from the tap \u2013 and decried the environmental impact of the plastic bottles it usually comes in. \u201cPure drink or pure hype?\u201d the National Resources Defense Council asked in 1999, and the question has never gone away. Until now, however, such objections have had little impact on the growth of the industry, whose sales topped 10bn gallons in the US for the first time in 2013 \u2013 32 gallons per person \u2013 and are projected to be as high as 13bn gallons in 2014.  The US is now the world\u2019s second-biggest consumer of bottled water, behind China. Nestl\u00e9 and the other water giants, Coca-Cola and Pepsi, have often cut deals with relatively isolated, impoverished rural communities whereby they take a percentage of the local water supply, paying enough to keep municipal rates low for local residents. Government oversight often falls between the cracks of state agencies, the US Forest Service and autonomous Indian tribes, giving the companies greater leeway. The Desert Sun investigation found that a Nestl\u00e9 pumping operation at Strawberry Creek in the San Bernardino National Forest, 60 miles east of Los Angeles, had been unlicensed since 1987. Another operation in the same National Forest, at Deer Canyon Springs, involves a deal between Nestl\u00e9 and the local water district that has not been permitted since 1994.  The US Forest Service, which has undergone multiple budget cuts over past decades and has been under attack for its handling of fire prevention and restoration in the parched American West as well as water management, now says that dealing with the expired permits and considering whether to renew them is now a \u201ctop priority\u201d.  One key question will be how much water Nestl\u00e9 is taking to create what one industry group delightfully calls \u201cthe quintessential hydrating beverage\u201d. The company claims 700m gallons a year, or about what it takes to keep two golf courses green. That might more easily be verified if legislation to force regular disclosure of volumes bottled and sold had not been vetoed by former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2008 and 2010.  Another regulatory headache, according to the activist group Food and Water Watch, is the near-absence of legislation governing groundwater \u2013 an absence largely explained by the lobbying power of agribusiness in a state that boasts the single most productive concentration of farm land on the planet.    Related: California water restrictions have not stopped the sprinklers from flowing    Governor Jerry Brown, who has come under fire for imposing a 25% reduction in water use on cities and municipalities but not on farms, signed a relatively toothless law last year that gave the state no power to assign rights to groundwater use.  According to Adam Scow, California director of Food and Water Watch, the governor and state agencies could in theory disregard the legislature and act on the California constitution which bars \u201cwaste or unreasonable use\u201d of the state\u2019s water supply.  \u201cWe need to start managing and protecting groundwater as a public resource,\u201d Scow said. \u201cIn a drought, bottling public water for private profit qualifies as wasteful and unreasonable.\u201d",

        "body": "Water has its own language in this town. Residents talk about nervous neighbors \u201cpulling the hose\u201d, or speculate about which houses on a street are \u201con the line\u201d. People gripe about how neighbors use \u201ctank water\u201d to hydrate plants.  That water lingo developed in this rural city of 6,700 \u2013 mostly poor Latino farm workers \u2013 should not be surprising. There has been a preoccupation with the stuff that comes from the tap since residents started running out of it. East Porterville is the epicenter of individual suffering in drought-stricken California. Nearly 1,000 private wells that once delivered water to homes and small businesses inside Tulare County have dried up, leaving desperate residents with just a few costly options, and no water. In all of California, there are 800 more such wells. Now, as the well failures expand and without much water infrastructure to speak of, the people of East Porterville are expecting a long, hot summer without precipitation. Waterless residents are struggling to shower, cook and clean. And more permanent solutions, such as drilling a new well, come with no small amount of expense, frustration and worry.     The Tule River in Porterville is dry except for a few pools of water. Photograph: Scott Smith/AP    State and county officials, along with a patchwork of volunteers, have taken up emergency measures, delivering bottles and installing tanks. But with few solutions, the intensifying drought is likely to only worsen the water nightmare here. East Porterville\u2019s unofficial water maven, Donna Johnson, encountered her first dry well last spring \u2013 her own. Though water would sometimes dribble out of her faucet through the hot summer months, she didn\u2019t accept that her well could fail until weeks after it actually did. Almost a month had passed when her husband, Howard, attempted to extend the well by 10ft. As he lowered an electric pump into the hole that once supplied their home with water, there was an audible \u201cclunk\u201d when their should have been a splash. So Johnson started asking around: Do you have water? \u201cI thought it might have been 15, 20 wells\u201d that went dry, said Johnson. But as she went door to door asking, the list of people who had no water \u2013 to drink, cook, clean or bathe \u2013 only grew. When it reached 100, she called local authorities. \u201cHad she not done that, I don\u2019t know that we would have had any sense of the severity of it,\u201d said Andrew Lockman, Tulare County\u2019s emergency manager. Johnson didn\u2019t stop at 100. She kept knocking on doors, asking folks if their well had gone dry. The answer, over and over again, was yes. She delivered bottled water, buying it with her own money, earning her the nickname \u201cwater angel\u201d. Since the county started tracking private well failures in September, 996 have been reported, the vast majority in East Porterville. County officials have approved more than 2,600 well-drilling permits; 654 households have bottled drinking water hand-delivered; and the United Way of Tulare County has received 683 drought-related calls for assistance. The water angel\u2019s efforts have caused spats with her husband. She receives late-night phone calls from hysterical mothers without water. Friends and neighbors \u2013 even her well contractor \u2013 have spit frustration her way, for lack of anywhere else to turn. \u201cNobody had a concept of what it was like to live without water,\u201d Johnson told the Guardian. Fewer still know when it\u2019s going to come back. Emergency measures, from the pastor to the governor     Pastor Frankie Olmedo, left, who volunteers four hours a day to hand out water, fills up a container for Luis Bocanegra in Porterville. Photograph: Lucy Nicholson/Reuters    About 80 homes in East Porterville now have small, clear boxes sitting out front. The square plastic tanks hold around 350 gallons of non-potable water. It\u2019s enough to run toilets and take showers, but nothing with which to wash dishes or cook. The county has installed 53 large potable water tanks, which hold up to 2,500 gallons of water at homes around Tulare. Thirty-one such tanks sit in East Porterville. More water comes in bottles, distributed from churches, the county and Johnson herself. And there remains hope that the end of April could bring a storm. More people still have improvised solutions of their own. Some have hooked a neighbor\u2019s garden hose to their house, cautiously sipping from a neighbor\u2019s well. (When a well-owner takes the water back, that\u2019s called \u201cpulling the hose\u201d.) Others haul water home in giant barrels or gray plastic garbage cans from a large tank at the town\u2019s fire station.   Related: California drought spurs protest over 'unconscionable' bottled water business    At Iglesia Emanuel, where a trailer with 16 emergency showers sits in the parking lot, a steady stream of cars pass through the lot looking for bottled water. Security guard Daisy Martinez directs the drivers to the pastor\u2019s remaining bottles. \u201cEvery day there\u2019s always people asking for water,\u201d said Martinez, a new mother who lives in Porterville on the municipal water system. \u201cHe runs out very quickly.\u201d Pastor Ramon Hernandez gave away his final box on Wednesday morning. He didn\u2019t expect more until the following week. Of course, East Porterville isn\u2019t the only town experiencing extreme drought in California. Nearly the entire state is at least \u201cabnormally dry\u201d (0.14% is not). Almost half the state (44%) is in \u201cexceptional\u201d drought, the most severe condition, according to the US Drought Monitor. That prompted Governor Jerry Brown to declare mandatory restrictions on urban water use, ordering a 25% cutback. The measures, however necessary, have been criticized for not requiring enough of agriculture, which accounts for 80% of human water use in the state. Still, some researchers believe much of California\u2019s water use remains obscured by a complex regulatory system built around the state\u2019s most precious resource. California\u2019s water rights system regulates surface water but not groundwater, making it difficult to track which users slurp up the most water, despite acknowledgements from the state water board that the two resources are interdependent. Two scientists at the University of California found that the state\u2019s surface water alone is over-allocated by a factor of five, and that it\u2019s unclear how much water California actually uses. \u201cWithout improvements to the water rights system,\u201d they wrote last summer, \u201cgrowing human and environmental demands portend an intensification of regional water scarcity and social conflict.\u201d Surface water is allocated by water rights in California. Groundwater, by comparison, is largely free for the taking, unregulated by the state board. In an effort to mitigate the regulatory gulf between surface water and groundwater, California\u2019s legislature passed a law to require sustainability plans from local water agencies. However, the law won\u2019t be in full effect until 2040. Meanwhile, the San Joaquin Valley is one of the heaviest groundwater users in the state, and authorities have known for some time that many small California towns lean heavily on groundwater supplies. A 2003 Department of Water Resources report expressed this in the plainest of terms: \u201cMany small- to moderate-sized towns and cities are entirely dependent on groundwater for drinking water supplies.\u201d Up to 50% of Californians use groundwater for at least part of their water supply, but there is little data or management of the resource, the report said. Groundwater generally supplies most domestic uses in Tulare County, according to Lockman, the county\u2019s emergency manager. Both East Porterville and its sister city Porterville are dependent on such groundwater. The key difference between the two cities is that Porterville has water, and East Porterville does not. \u2018The poor get poorer\u2019, from Porterville to East Porterville       Porterville was developed with a municipal water system hooked to a deep, industrial-grade well. Residents of Porterville depend on groundwater as much as their neighbors to the east, but because the larger city has infrastructure to pump from a deep aquifer, taps in Porterville haven\u2019t gone dry. The lack of public infrastructure in East Porterville is part of what makes the \u201cdisaster\u201d so difficult to mitigate: to get federal cash, a disaster must impact public infrastructure. In East Porterville, it\u2019s largely impoverished farm workers bearing the brunt of the drought. \u201cThis is a kind of the-poor-get-poorer situation,\u201d said Lockman. \u201cIt really is just like after a hurricane, and you still have a roof over your head but you can\u2019t flush the toilet, you don\u2019t have water.\u201d Anecdotally, many residents of East Porterville work at citrus packing plants or pick oranges or grapes, according to locals. The per capita income is $11,046. Parishioners at Hernandez\u2019s church, for example, are almost all farm workers, he said. Of the 1,700 residences in East Porterville, 69.3% don\u2019t speak English at home, according to the US Census Bureau. Without infrastructure, homeowners of East Porterville have to find water by their own means. Usually, that means drilling a new well, at a cost of $10,000 to $30,000, according to Lockman. Payment options are limited. There are some grant programs available, but most cover only a third of the cost of drilling. Low-interest loans are available, but the exorbitant cost of drilling can make payments hundreds of dollars per month. The county\u2019s ability to help is also limited by cash. Installing a municipal water system in East Porterville would likely take the better part of a decade and cost up to $60m, Lockman said. And that cost only includes pipes.  Connecting to Porterville\u2019s water is also tenuous. Some houses are simply out of the system\u2019s reach, miles from the nearest connections; for others constructing a connection is too expensive. The divide between Porterville and East Porterville, and even between neighbors with city water or dry wells, has created an aura of anxiety. There\u2019s sniping between those trying to help, and bickering between neighbors. The topic of water can be delicate even between family members. Dalia Madrigal is a cashier at Hari\u2019s Market, a Valero gas station and convenience store on one of East Porterville\u2019s main thoroughfares. Her house, which she rents with four other people including a two-year-old, hasn\u2019t had water since July.

She, her husband and her son take \u201ctwo-minute\u201d showers. And she fears seeing sand come from the tap, a sign that a pump is delivering the last water reserves of an empty well. \u201cI\u2019m scared because sometimes my pressure goes really low,\u201d said Nungaray. She said she was especially nervous when her neighbors\u2019 well pump had a mechanical problem. She feared that their well had gone dry. \u201cWhen your neighbor starts having problems, you\u2019re going to have problems.\u201d While most people seem to take the shortage in good humor, the stress is evident.     Is there water at the end of the rainbow \u2013 or just more suffering?

Rodriguez\u2019s family uses a hose from his neighbor\u2019s house, an informal agreement that costs Rodriguez $50 per month. His business is also without water. California\u2019s drought is only expected to intensify through the summer, according to the Climate Prediction Center, making a full recharge of East Porterville\u2019s wells unlikely. Tulare County, identified by the state as a high priority for installing groundwater management, is overdrafting its supply by around 65m gallons per year. In the meantime, Lockman said, the county is attempting to provide \u201cfirst-world type of things\u201d.

        "body": "Half of leading bottled-water brands source their product from drought-stricken California, a fact that has media and consumer groups up in arms. It doesn\u2019t help matters that the process by which companies gain access to public water sources in California is fairly opaque, or that the state keeps no record of how much groundwater the \u201cspring water\u201d bottlers \u2013 Arrowhead (owned by Nestle), Ethos (owned by Starbucks), Refreshe (Safeway) and Crystal Geyser \u2013 use. To make matters worse, new groundwater management regulations won\u2019t change that until 2020. The news that many bottlers operating in California\u2019s national forests are doing so with long-expired permits has only added fuel to the fire. An investigation by the Desert Sun newspaper in Palm Springs, California, revealed earlier this month that Nestle has been piping water out of Southern California\u2019s San Bernardino National Forest under a permit that expired in 1988. The paper found that Nestle\u2019s was one of dozens of similarly expired permits. In response, Tim Brown, chairman, president and CEO of Nestle Waters North America, responded with an opinion piece in the San Bernardino Sun defending his company\u2019s practices and noting that, under federal law, Nestle\u2019s national forest permit is valid until deemed otherwise.    No agency is currently tracking what\u2019s available in groundwater aquifers, or how much is being pumped out of them.    Brown also equated Nestle\u2019s use of California water \u2013 705m gallons a year, bottled at five plants across the state \u2013 to the average annual watering needs of two California golf courses. For water rights advocates, though, there are broader implications. \u201cIt highlights a bigger policy problem: the state doesn\u2019t track groundwater,\u201d said Adam Scow, of water rights nonprofit Food and Water Watch. Scow added that pumping groundwater has a bigger impact in some parts of the state than others, an impact that is inadequately measured by simply comparing the number of gallons used for bottled water to the number of gallons used for other purposes in the state.  \u201cIf Nestle continues to pump in Southern California at high rates, during a drought, when it\u2019s not being recharged, it will be over-drafting that groundwater source,\u201d Scow said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a big problem when you\u2019ve got wells going dry and people in the state without access to clean drinking water.\u201d Piping without permits The problems with granting private access to public water go beyond Nestle\u2019s national forest permit, according to Peter Gleick, executive director of nonprofit water research organization Pacific Institute. \u201cIf society is going to bother regulating and protecting public water and public lands by issuing permits limiting and managing water use, they should do it right,\u201d said Gleick, who authored a book about the problem with Americans\u2019 fondness for bottled water. \u201cPaper permits are worthless when it comes to protecting the public interest.\u201d San Bernardino National Forest Supervisor Jody Noiron has said that reviewing Nestle\u2019s permit \u2013 as well as other water permits in the forest \u2013 is now a top priority.     The plant that bottles water for Safeway and Ethos draws from two areas described as being in \u201cexceptional drought\u201d.    Sounding every bit the overloaded and underfunded government employee, Noiron told various media outlets that she had not realized the permit had expired so long ago, and that the issue would now move to the top of the pile. She has also said that various environmental laws were not yet on the books in the 1970s, when Arrowhead first applied for the permit that Nestle now holds. The permit will now need to be updated with respect to those laws, which could take anywhere from 18 months to more than two years, she added. Even if the review is updated to comply with current laws, though, it might still fail to address the concerns of water rights activists. \u201cWe have to ask the bigger question: is this a reasonable and beneficial use of public water?\u201d Scow said. \u201cOf course it\u2019s not.\u201d No one knows what\u2019s in the well There\u2019s also the issue of water use transparency, which is murky at best. Local permitting agencies tend to look only at the immediate environmental impact of a groundwater pipeline or bottling facility, while the state water board monitors only the quality of bottled water.  No agencies currently track what\u2019s available in groundwater aquifers, or how much is being pumped out of them. A prime example of the fallout is the Safeway-Lucerne bottling plant in Merced, California. The plant bottles water both for Safeway stores and for Starbucks\u2019 Ethos water \u2013 the sales of which, ironically, generates donations for international water charities.  Using groundwater from the Merced area for Safeway and groundwater from a private spring at the foot of the Sierra Nevadas for Ethos, the plant draws from two areas described by the US National Drought Mitigation Center as being in \u201cexceptional drought\u201d. But no information is publicly available as to how much groundwater is being used or how much is available in the aquifers. In fact, due to the state\u2019s historic mismanagement of groundwater, those details may not be known.  Scow said he hopes the current attention around what he called \u201cthe most egregious misuses of public water\u201d \u2013 bottled water, fracking, and corporate agriculture growing water-hungry crops in the driest parts of the state \u2013 will encourage California Governor Jerry Brown to take a more aggressive position.  \u201cThe state has all the power it needs to manage groundwater right now,\u201d Scow said. \u201cI don\u2019t expect Nestle to voluntarily stop making money bottling water. That\u2019s why we have government. We just need them to step up and govern.\u201d Unnecessary luxury in a drought Bottlers have also argued that while Americans consume about 10bn gallons of bottled water a year, California alone uses 38bn gallons a day.  Still, there are significant energy and material wastes inherent in the product. Only 38% of plastic bottles are recycled, and it takes about 1.6 liters of water to package and transport every liter, not to mention the energy costs. In a drought situation, Gleick said, every use of water needs to be re-examined. \u201cThe drought raises awareness of all water issues and offers an opportunity to look more carefully at every water-using sector of our economy, including bottled water,\u201d he said. \u201cUltimately, in the US and most developed nations, bottled water is a luxury, not a necessity. When drought forces us to look at all water uses, the first things to challenge are unnecessary luxuries.\u201d",

        "body": "At this time of year the fields around Mendota, the self-described \u201ccantaloupe capital of the world\u201d, should be green, hissing with sprinklers and humming with tractors. Labourers should be on buses criss-crossing lanes and highways as they plant cantaloupe and tend crops of alfalfa, cotton, wheat, tomato and broccoli. Instead, as far as the eye can see, the earth is brown and the landscape deserted. No tractors or buses, barely a sign of human activity, only stillness. The sound of drought is silence. As California enters its fourth parched year a hush has descended on this agricultural community, a mix of mainly white farmers and Latino labourers in the Central Valley 230 miles north of Los Angeles. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot quieter. You have an empty feeling,\u201d said Todd Allen, a third-generation farmer who has laid off most of his workers and fallowed all his 473 acres. \u201cThere\u2019s not that much to do except maintenance.\u201d His skeleton crew spends its days battling morning glory \u2013 \u201cthe terrible weed with the beautiful name\u201d \u2013 whose roots can burrow more than 20ft, sucking what little moisture remains in the soil. It is about the only thing thriving. The drought is reaping a heavy toll on farmers, forcing some to sell land and consider bankruptcy, and labourers, who are sliding deeper into poverty. Adaptation is proving painful and uncertain. \u201cIf people don\u2019t have water it\u2019ll just turn into a desert again,\u201d said Allen, 52, as he surveyed a field of baked, barren earth on his farm, 10 miles outside Mendota. \u201cThat\u2019s what this was before they built the whole system.\u201d That system \u2013 a network of reservoirs, aqueducts, pumps and canals to supplement rain, rivers and snowmelt \u2013 has broken down amid what climate scientists say is one of the worst dry spells in centuries.     Mendota, California   Some reservoirs, such as Lake McClure, are down to 10% capacity. State officials cancelled a trek to the Sierra Nevada to measure snowpack last week because there was no snow.  Snowpack supplies about 30% of California\u2019s water supply when it melts in late spring and summer, replenishing reservoirs. An April measurement showed snowpack water content at just 5% of what is normal for that time period. It is now thought to be down to 3% \u2013 half an inch. \u201cMajor reservoirs are dropping at a time when they typically would be filling with melted snow,\u201d Mark Cowin, director of California\u2019s department of water resources, warned in a statement. \u201cWe need careful, sparing use of water across the state, because we don\u2019t know when this drought will end.\u201d To help meet a state-wide target of a 25% cut in water use, Governor Jerry Brown has ordered a series of measures, including ripping up 50m square feet of lawns and daily fines of up to $10,000 for water wasters. \u201cWe are embarked upon an experiment that no one has ever tried,\u201d Brown said last month, when he announced rationing. For residents in coastal cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco, drought blares from headlines but, so far, has barely affected daily life. For those who depend on the fields around Mendota, however, it has unleashed what feels like an existential struggle. Allen\u2019s grandfather, an immigrant from Sweden, worked as a ranch-hand, building canals to irrigate crops, before buying his own land. By the 1970s and 1980s plentiful water \u2013 from rain and state-supplied allocation \u2013 helped the family farm thrive. \u201cMy dad had an airplane. It was like living the American dream,\u201d said Allen.     A sign at Todd Allen\u2019s farm suggests the state has its priorities wrong. Photograph: Rory Carroll for the Guardian    Trouble began in the 1990s, he said, when officials started allocating less water to farmers in order to protect the delta smelt and other threatened fish species. The Allens gradually moved to more efficient irrigation \u2013 from furrow, to sprinkler, to drip \u2013 and weathered the 2007 to 2009 drought, when the state reduced water supplies. But the latest drought has cut that supply entirely, leaving this married father of two to gaze at cloudless skies, wondering if rain will ever return, and to eye his savings, wondering if he can afford $500,000 to drill a well more than 1,000ft deep, joining a scramble for groundwater. Scientists have expressed alarm at the quantity being sucked up. Such deep water, in any case, is of lousy quality, said Allen. \u201cPretty salty. It would kill the trees eventually.\u201d California\u2019s water system was built for human beings, not the smelt, he said. \u201cWhen you put this worthless two-inch fish in front of me and my family, that\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s insanity.\u201d    When you put this worthless two-inch fish in front of me and my family, that\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s insanity       Environmentalists dispute that, saying the smelt is a barometer for a fragile, embattled ecosystem in San Francisco bay\u2019s delta. Allen sold a chunk of land last year to deep-pocketed pistachio growers and may sell more to put his adolescent daughters through college. \u201cMy wife doesn\u2019t let me whine and complain. She says we need to count our blessings.\u201d The labourers of Mendota have rather fewer blessings. The impoverished, dusty town, made up almost entirely of migrants from El Salvador and Mexico, has never had it easy, let alone lived the American dream. About half the 11,000 residents live below the poverty line. Two out of three students do not graduate from high school. Agricultural swings batter the economy. A good year keeps unemployment to about 20%, four times the national average. A bad year sees it soar to 50%. A Guardian tour of the area via Route 33 last week turned up just one working crew, 16 men and women in jeans and baseball caps who fanned across an alfalfa field, a rare patch of green nourished by a nearby well.     A rusting water pipe in one of Todd Allen\u2019s fallow fields. Photograph: Rory Carroll for the Guardian    Before the drought there would have been dozens more people out here planting lettuce, tomatoes, melon and cotton, said Jos\u00e9 Flores, 40, the foreman, perspiring in 90-degree heat. \u201cIf this continues we\u2019ll move to other states.\u201d Many had already migrated to slaughterhouse jobs in Minnesota, said Flores. At midday unemployed labourers lounged in the centre of town, a sleepy collection of sun-bleached one-storey homes and businesses. \u201cWhen the pool hall opens we go there,\u201d said one man, leaning against a wall for shade. He declined to give his name. \u201cAnd when the food truck comes we go there,\u201d said Isabel M\u00e9ndez, 62. It comes once a month and she missed the last one, she said. \u201cI got the day wrong.\u201d Officials have blamed unemployment for spikes in crime and drunkenness. The mayor and city manager did not respond to interview requests. Local businesses reported sharply reduced revenues. \u201cCustomers can\u2019t spend anything compared to two years ago,\u201d said Ali Mohsen, who owns a phone shop. The exception was Johnny Amador, a flower and balloon seller. Latino culture mandated families to celebrate birthdays and other occasions, he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll do what it takes. Save, haggle, ask for credit.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWe don\u2019t do credit anymore. We\u2019ve had enough people burn us.\u201d",

        "body": "Walmart is the latest company found to be sourcing its bottled water from drought-stricken California, as state residents push for greater regulation of the bottling industry. Starbucks was moved to alter its bottling practices in California last week and Mount Shasta community members are fighting the opening of a major bottling plant by California-based company Crystal Geyser. Then on Friday, an investigation by CBS13 in Sacramento found that Walmart\u2019s bottled water comes from the Sacramento municipal water supply.  The revelations come as state residents face increased water use limits during the fourth year of drought in the state. State governor Jerry Brown signed an executive order last week that calls for a 25% urban water reduction across the state.  \u201cIt\u2019s only logical that as the governor has asked all Californians to reduce their water consumption that he holds extractive industries like bottled water companies to the same standard, yet he hasn\u2019t asked anything of them,\u201d said Adam Scow, the California director of Food &amp; Water Watch, which is calling for a moratorium on bottling water.  There is little oversight or monitoring of bottling plants in the state, which are also operated by major corporations including Nestle, Coca-Cola and Pepsi.  About 1% of state water is used in industry, and the bottling industry represents an even smaller fraction of that, according to the US Geological Survey. Walmart, like other large companies, draws water from municipal supplies to keep costs down. A Walmart spokesperson said that the company is \u201cvery concerned\u201d about how the drought is affecting its customers and associates.  \u201cWe share those concerns and are tracking it closely,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cOur commitment to sustainability includes efforts to minimize water use in our facilities. We have and continue to work with our suppliers to act responsibly while meeting the needs of customers who count on us across California.\u201d Starbucks was pushed to stop sourcing its Ethos bottled water from California after Mother Jones  discovered that it had been drawing water from Placer County. Starbucks said it would move production to a supplier in Pennsylvania over the next six months. It is also looking for alternative suppliers for its west coast distribution.  \u201cAt the end of the day, bottling the public\u2019s water for private profit is not in the public interest,\u201d said Scow.  He said the practice has a negative effect on local watersheds, that the oil and energy used to make plastic bottles and transport them across the nation are harmful to the environment and that there is a huge waste problem with plastic bottle disposal.  Crystal Geyser, a bottled water company headquartered in San Francisco, announced it is opening a new plant near Mount Shasta, which feeds water into the Sacramento River. The company does not need to obtain a permit to draw the water and there is not a requirement to conduct an environmental impact report. Raven Stevens, community liaison for the Gateway Neighborhood Association, told the San Francisco Chronicle that the top concern is that there is little regulation for bottling plants.  \u201cCrystal Geyser in one day plans to pump more water than any three of my neighbors will use in an entire year,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cThe entire state is under a 25% cut, farmers are letting fields go fallow and we don\u2019t have one piece of legislation regulating water bottling.\u201d",

Frankly, we\u2019re very happy they are doing it in a healthier way.\u201d Brown admitted that Nestl\u00e9 currently wastes about 30% of the 700m gallons of water a year it draws from the ground in California. On Tuesday, the company announced plans to reduce water waste at its bottling plants in Bakersfield and Tulare by 12%. More than 82,000 people have signed a petition calling on Nestl\u00e9 to stop bottling from a spring in southern California, and protesters armed with plastic pitchforks have blocked the entrance to a Nestl\u00e9 plant in Sacramento. Despite the protests, Brown said: \u201cWe feel good about what we\u2019re doing delivering healthy hydrating to people throughout the state of California.\u201d Starbucks has announced plans to stop sourcing its bottled water from California after embarrassing revelations that its \u201cwater conservation\u201d Ethos brand bottled water was sourced from the drought-stricken state. \u201cIt seems hard to imagine, but more than 1bn people on our planet can\u2019t get clean water to drink,\u201d Starbucks says on its website. \u201cEthos\u00ae Water was created to help raise awareness about this terrible crisis and provide children with access to clean water.\u201d Five cents from the sale of each Ethos bottle, which costs about $2, goes towards Starbucks\u2019 Ethos Water Fund supporting water, sanitation and hygiene education programs across the world. The company said it would move Ethos production to Pennsylvania for the duration of the drought. \u201cWe are committed to our mission to be a globally responsible company and to support the people of the state of California as they face this unprecedented drought,\u201d John Kelly, Starbucks\u2019 senior vice-president of global responsibility and public policy, said last week.  Walmart, which also bottles water in California, has refused to move its production out of the state. \u201cThe drought in California is very concerning for many of our customers and our associates,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cWe share those concerns and are tracking it closely. Our commitment to sustainability includes efforts to minimize water use in our facilities. We have and continue to work with our suppliers to act responsibly while meeting the needs of customers who count on us across California.\u201d Sustainability charity Food &amp; Water Watch has called for a moratorium on all water bottling across the state. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst drought we\u2019ve seen in a long time, and it\u2019s irresponsible of the state to allow Nestl\u00e9 to bottle water that\u2019s supposed to be a public resource,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cWe\u2019re calling for a moratorium on bottling water for private profit.\u201d",

        "body": "The California drought, now in its fourth year, is set to cost the agriculture sector $1.8bn in direct losses this year, researchers at the University of California, Davis found in a study released on Tuesday. The loss represents around 4% of the state\u2019s massive $45bn agriculture economy. When indirect losses are included on top of direct ones to the agriculture industry, the same study found that this year\u2019s ongoing drought is set to cost the California economy a total of $2.7bn.   Related: California farmers resign themselves to drought: 'Nobody's fault but God's'    The UC Davis study, authored by Richard Howitt, Jay Lund, Josue Medellin-Azuara, Duncan MacEwan and Daniel Summer, estimated that around 564,000 acres of previously farmable land would be made fallow this year, resulting in around half of the direct loss in revenue. Droughts affect farming because of the reduction in available surface water. Dwindling bodies of surface water \u2013 a term used to refer to waters above the ground, like streams and lakes \u2013 lead farmers to turn to groundwater pumping, using water found below the ground. When farmers have no access to groundwater or do not have the means to pump, they may choose to either sell their land or leave it to fallow, Jay Lund, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at UC Davis and one of the study\u2019s authors, explained. Pumping for groundwater alone is set to cost the industry $600m this year. Full- and part-time job losses in the agriculture sector caused by the drought are estimated at 8,650, with total job losses estimated at 18,600 when spillover effects are taken into consideration. But year-to-year jobs are actually set to increase in the state\u2019s agriculture industry overall, despite these estimated losses, the authors said. Losses of jobs described in the study are based on analyses of the California economy over the last few years and expectations for continued growth. The bulk of those jobs lost as a consequence of the drought would have been of the temporary, seasonal kind. The number of jobs lost includes jobs that would have gone to undocumented workers, the authors confirmed in a presentation before the California State Board of Food and Agriculture on Tuesday. In an independent analysis, Paul Wessen, an economist with California\u2019s Employment Development Department, said jobs in the California agriculture industry were down this April compared to the same month the previous year. In the absolute, California\u2019s economy is actually doing well, Paul Wessen, an economist with California\u2019s employment development department, said. California\u2019s non-farm economy does not appear to be affected by the drought, he said. The state entered its fourth year of drought this year. On 1 April, California governor Jerry Brown announced the state\u2019s first ever mandatory water restrictions. The executive order\u2019s aim is to reduce water used statewide in urban areas by 25% compared to 2013. Agriculture, which accounts for around three-quarters of the state\u2019s water usage, was largely exempt. \u201cWater is always going to be controversial in California. Water is a scarce resource here,\u201d Lund at UC Davis said. \u201cBut California has a large economy and a large agricultural sector. It\u2019s rich enough that we can keep these ecosystems around and find solutions to manage them,\u201d Lund said.",

        "body": "At first sight, the scrubby land around Lost Hills in California\u2019s Central Valley looks like the worst place in the world to grow anything. The climate is unrelentingly hot, dry and smoggy. The soil frequently leaches toxic white selenium salts. And the area is dotted with oil wells \u2013 the tail end of a century-long oil boom that has sucked away precious water resources, brought benzene and other toxins to the surface and each year generates tens of billions of gallons of chemical-laden wastewater, some of which has been found to be stored in unlined pits threatening the integrity of the desperately depleted local groundwater supply. Yet Lost Hills is the centre of an extraordinary almond and pistachio empire \u2013 crops now nicknamed \u201cthe devil\u2019s nut\u201d in some quarters, because they require more water than seems decent in the midst of an epochal drought. Stands of trees stretch out for miles in every direction along the interstate highway and the California Aqueduct, and right up to the property line separating the holdings of Paramount Farming, the local agribusiness powerhouse, from Chevron, Seneca, Aera and other companies prospecting for what\u2019s left of the region\u2019s heavy, sludgy oil.    Related: Long-suffering California can blame drought on global warming, experts say    More fields are being planted all the time. Stewart Resnick, perhaps the most powerful agricultural entrepreneur in California who owns Paramount, expects US pistachio production alone to reach one billion pounds around the end of the decade \u2013 double where it was five years ago. In the 1980s, the Lost Hills area had no nuts at all. Nothing, not even a continuing drought, seems likely to stop him because he has direct access to a vast, supposedly public water resource pumped in from northern California and is lobbying for more via his extensive network of political contacts that include, notably, the state\u2019s senior senator, Dianne Feinstein. It\u2019s a situation that, in many ways, defies the laws of nature. While the rest of the Central Valley is gagging for water, Resnick\u2019s irrigation canals are full, the pumps on his land are humming and his trucks can hardly move the crop fast enough to processing plants and thence to the booming Chinese export market. Conservation and environmentalist groups are incensed \u2013 and growing more concerned now that California\u2019s governor, Jerry Brown, has proposed a multibillion-dollar tunnel project to bring more water from the Sacramento river delta down to Resnick\u2019s empire in Kern County and over the Tehachapi mountains to Los Angeles.  They are calling it a boondoggle and an outrage that will feed the insatiable thirst of Paramount\u2019s nut trees, disturb vital ecosystems in the San Joaquin Sacramento delta and, they fear, leave taxpayers footing the bill for the construction costs, estimated at anywhere between $15bn and more than $60bn.     A sign in the Lost Hills. Photograph: Andrew Gumbel    \u201cLike the oil barons of old, now it\u2019s the water barons that rule the San Joaquin Valley,\u201d said Conner Everts, executive director of the Southern California Watershed Alliance, who has campaigned on water issues for 40 years. At a protest this week outside the Los Angeles offices of Paramount\u2019s $4bn parent company, Wonderful \u2013 whose holdings also include Fiji Water, Teleflora and the Pom Wonderful range of pomegranate juices and other products \u2013 activists dressed up in almond masks and held signs that read: \u201cMore Resnick Almonds = less H2O for CA.\u201d \u201cWho are they wonderful for?\u201d protester Ann Shabtay said of the proposed tunnels. \u201cNot for us, not for the taxpayers.\u201d Everts and other campaigning environmentalists hope they can lobby powerful regional politicians including the Los Angeles mayor, Eric Garcetti, to tell Governor Brown they don\u2019t need the extra water because they are working hard to conserve and save locally. Los Angeles cut consumption by more than 15% over the past year, and the state as a whole reduced urban usage by 27%. But the tunnels are popular in Kern County, where farmers and residents are so desperate for water they don\u2019t mind where it comes from or who pays for it.  \u201cIs Growing Food Wasting Water?\u201d read one sign dotted around Lost Hills. Another said: \u201cNo water = no jobs.\u201d With the public comment period on the tunnels project now extended to the end of October, a major battle is in the offing.    Related: Vast areas of California are sinking as groundwater is pumped in drought    A coalition of environmental activists recently proposed spending a fraction of the cost of the tunnels \u2013 no more than $1bn \u2013 to take all the land in the western San Joaquin Valley including Resnick\u2019s land out of agricultural production, for which it is unsuitable in the first place. They estimate that alone would save California about 455,000 acre-feet, or about 150bn US gallons of water a year \u2013 not much less than Los Angeles consumes.  \u201cThe western valley is one of the most inappropriate places to farm,\u201d said Adam Scow, California director of the group Food and Water Watch. \u201cNot only is it the hottest, driest part, the selenium contamination requires extra water to flush it out. Much of that land should be retired.\u201d However logical that might sound in terms of public management of a dwindling resource, Scow and his partners know they are shooting for the moon. A famous book about water wars in the American west put it perhaps most succinctly: \u201cWater flows uphill towards money.\u201d  Resnick and his wife Lynda do not just have money. They are reaping the benefits of a closed-door deal struck in 1994 that has proved to be the very foundation of their agricultural empire and has endured despite legal challenges. The state\u2019s department of water resources gave them de facto control of the Kern Water Bank, a large groundwater storage facility, fed in part by publicly subsidized northern Californian sources, that was originally intended as a fallback in times of drought and also a powerful political instrument with which to control agribusiness and property development. The Resnicks have not just been able to draw on the Water Bank to build their nut-tree empire. They are also empowered to sell any surplus from the bank to public water agencies for profit.    Related: California drought will persist despite 'significant and strengthening' El Ni\u00f1o    A tiny handful of elected politicians have protested about this over the years, but many more have benefited from the Resnicks\u2019 largesse \u2013 nearly $5m in campaign contributions to state and federal office-holders over the last 20 years.  Gray Davis, who ended up being recalled as governor in 2003, in part because he was viewed as being in hock to a number of special interests, was a particularly loyal political contact who appointed Resnick to head his agriculture and water transition team. Senator Feinstein, who faced only token opposition, received just under $10,000 from the Resnicks for her 2012 re-election. The effect on the region\u2019s groundwater supply is difficult to gauge exactly, because California passed its first law regulating groundwater usage only last year and that won\u2019t go into full effect until the 2040s. However, the state already regarded Kern County\u2019s groundwater to be in a state of \u201ccritical overdraft\u201d in 1980 and the situation has grown far worse since. The latest data from an ongoing study by Nasa this week showed that California\u2019s Central Valley is sinking by as much as two inches a month because of groundwater pumping that has only grown more frenetic as the drought, now in its fourth year, has persisted. One of the worst affected areas is just 35 miles north of Lost Hills. Everts, the Southern California Watershed Alliance director, said the problem was much bigger than just the Resnicks. He blamed the dysfunctional allocation of water and the enthusiasm for building another vast infrastructure project to pump water from north to south on what he called the \u201chydrological brotherhood\u201d \u2013 a confluence of interests that includes politicians looking for signature projects, engineers, builders and financiers as well as big Central Valley growers. At its simplest, he said, the problem was that California\u2019s water agencies were in the impossible position of being responsible for selling water while at the same time somehow being expected to save it.  \u201cIt\u2019s not a surprise they haven\u2019t figured out how to make money out of using less water,\u201d Everts said. \u201cThey need incentives, not tunnels.\u201d",

        "body": "From his front door to the banks of the Cantareira reservoir, Jos\u00e9 Christiano da Silva used to stroll only a hundred metres when he first moved to the area in 2009. Today, amid the worst drought in S\u00e3o Paulo's history, he must now trek a kilometre across the dried-up bed before he reaches what's left of the most important water supply for South America's biggest city.\"It's frightening to look at,\" says the retiree, standing on cracked mud. \"In the past, we'd already be under water here.\" After the driest six months since records began 84 years ago, the volume of the Cantareira system has fallen to 10.7% of its capacity, raising alarms for the nearby urban population of 20 million people and the most important economic hub on the continent.The drought, affecting Brazil's southeast and central regions, has prompted rationing in 19 cities, undermined hydropower generation, pushed up greenhouse gas emissions and led to squabbles between states vying for dwindling water resources.Supplies are usually abundant. Brazil has 12% of the world's freshwater and less than 3% of the world population. Apart from the arid northeastern Cerrado, its cities are normally more likely to be plagued with floods than droughts. With big rivers like the Amazon and Paran\u00e1, the country generally meets 80% of energy needs with hydropower.But this year, the rain fronts that are normally carried south from the humid Amazon have largely failed to materialise and temperatures have been higher than usual, prompting the authorities to scrabble to tap new sources and reduce demand. \"It has been a terrible year. The last rainy season was drier than the dry season,\" Mauro Arce, S\u00e3o Paulo's water resources secretary, told the Guardian. \"This is a crisis and we are responding with technical measures and the support of consumers.\"In S\u00e3o Paulo city, that has meant financial incentives to encourage residents and businesses to reduce consumption, the reduction of water pressure by 75% at night (which in effect means a cut for those \u2013 often the poor \u2013 living in high areas) and tapping alternative supplies. In neighbouring cities, like Gaurulhos, more draconian measures are in place with some neighbourhoods only able to get water one day in three.Tensions have emerged between cities, and between those who want water for energy and those who need it for drinking, food and sanitation.S\u00e3o Paulo has tussled with Rio de Janeiro over the use of the Rio Jaguari, a river that runs across state borders and is used by the latter for hydropower plants and to dilute sewage in the absence of adequate treatment plants. S\u00e3o Paulo, which is downstream, has tapped this river to partially recuperate the Paraiba reservoir system despite the protests of its neighbour and admonitions from the federal government.\"We're defending the inhabitants of S\u00e3o Paulo,\" said Arce. \"Brazilian law is very clear. In situations like the one we face now, the priority is people and animals \u2026 People in Rio should have no concerns. They have a lot of water.\"Local newspapers have referred to the dispute as a \"water war\", though it is more an argument about who will bear the costs of the drought. Water and electricity prices are expected to rise a month or two after the elections in October. Power utilities said last month that the loss of hydro-generating capacity had cost them 15.8bn reais (\u00a34.3bn). Most of this was spent on more expensive oil and other carbon-based fuels that filled the gap in electricity supply. This in turn has pushed up Brazil's greenhouse gas emissions this year.The outlook is as unpredictable as the weather. Government officials say that at current levels of depletion, the Cantareira system would empty in less than 100 days. The top two of the five reservoirs have been drawn down and now \"dead water\" \u2013 which is normally left untouched as a minimum level \u2013 is being pumped out of the third. City planners say they have an emergency plan to use still more dead water if the situation does not improve by November.The first rains of spring this week have brought only partial relief. Despite a downpour on Tuesday night, the water levels of the Cantareira reservoir remained unchanged. In the current climate, even this was hailed as a victory.\"For the first time since April, the level didn't go down,\" said Arce, who says he is now having to draw up a fresh set of plans for the city because statistical predictions have to be adjusted in the light of the new reality of this super-drought.Up next to the Cantareira too, the residents are also struggling to keep up with baselines and shorelines that keep moving further from the norm.After the top reservoir shrunk into the distance, Jos\u00e9 Christiano da Silva moved his boat to the next lake down, but even there the water is now retreating as a result of emergency pumping that started 15 days ago. It is already about 20 metres from where it was and he expects it to diminish further.\"I've never seen anything like it,\" he said.",

        "body": "The prize-winning gourds are bigger than ever and the festivals still draw huge crowds, but California may have reached peak pumpkin. Farmers defied a crippling drought to produce monster versions of the Halloween staple, but the overall number of pumpkins appears to be shrinking. The Half Moon Bay Art &amp; Pumpkin Festival \u2013 the \u201cSuper Bowl of weigh-offs\u201d - recently set a north American record with a 2,058lb gourd, but the number of entries fell from about 50 in previous years to 30, festival spokesman Tim Beeman said. \u201cThat is for sure because of the drought. If your water allowance is cut, then you grow fewer pumpkins.\u201d A three-year drought has parched California, the biggest producer after Illinois, and triggered water restrictions in many areas. Pumpkins need a lot of water. \u201cDrought is hurting the whole state. I may not grow next year if there is no water,\u201d said Pete Glasier, 84, a Napa grower whose 2,036lb gourd set a record earlier this month at a Morgan Hill farm weigh-in until eclipsed by Half Moon Bay\u2019s winner. \u201cYou can do a rain dance for us.\u201d John Muller, a pumpkin grower who serves on the Half Moon Bay city council, warned that another dry winter could trigger draconian water cutbacks. In Britain, by contrast, heavy October rain has turned pumpkins soft and soggy, leaving hundreds of thousands rotting in the fields \u2013 the worst season in a decade, according to growers.  California\u2019s record-breaking mega-pumpkins belied the state\u2019s drought because growers sacrificed multiplicity for size \u2013 and glory. Weigh-in competitions around the state draw hundreds of thousands of people and spur innovation among growers.     Boys run through a pumpkin patch in Half Moon Bay. Photograph: Stephen McLaren/Guardian    Half Moon Bay\u2019s inaugural winner 41 years ago weighed 150lbs, andever since, entries have grown heavier, said Beeman, thanks to improved seed genetics, cross-pollination, watering, nutrients and compost. \u201cThey\u2019ve perfected the craft and science of growing huge pumpkins. They\u2019re like mad scientists.\u201d Glasier grew the 2,036lb gourd in his back yard, using about 30 to 40 gallons of Napa city water a day. Water rationing may curb him next season, but he is confident other growers will advance. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably see a 2,500lb pumpkin in the next five years.\u201d Doug Perry, who owns a 91-acre farm near Facebook\u2019s headquarters in Silicon Valley, prefers to grow lots of ordinary pumpkins rather than a few that could rival a Ford Fiesta in weight. \u201cGiant pumpkins take up too much time. You have to practically sleep with them,\u201d he said. Perry, 60, uses water-efficient drip irrigation and is fortunate to have his own well but has still whittled his crop. \u201cIf you have water, you grow. If you haven\u2019t, you don\u2019t. It\u2019s kind of a tough deal.\u201d Pumpkins are vulnerable to pests, humidity and drought, but Perry discovered their cultural resilience a few years ago when he decided to switch crops \u2013 and upset families who used to visit his farm. \u201cWe took a year off the pumpkin and talk about chaos. The community let us know they really wanted this back. Coming to a pumpkin patch is part of people\u2019s lives. They do it as a family. It\u2019s an event.\u201d California\u2019s pumpkin community expressed bafflement at last week\u2019s riot at a pumpkin festival in Keene, New Hampshire, which saw fires, clashes with police, 30 injures and 84 arrests.  \u201cHere\u2019s it\u2019s a great community of growers,\u201d said Glasier, who lost the record for the heaviest gourd to a fellow Napa grower, John Hawkley. Rivalry was strong but friendly, he said. \u201cWe try to keep things peaceful. We don\u2019t want to create any acrimony or hard feelings. Some of my best friends grow pumpkins.

        "body": "The taps have run dry and the lights have gone out across swathes of Brazil this week as the worst drought in history spreads from S\u00e3o Paulo to Rio de Janeiro and beyond. More than four million people have been affected by rationing and rolling power cuts as this tropical nation discovers it can no longer rely on once abundant water supplies in a period of rising temperatures and diminishing rainfall. The political and economic fallout for the world\u2019s seventh biggest economy is increasingly apparent. Protesters in dry neighbourhoods have taken to the streets, coffee crops have been hit, businesses have been forced to close and peddle-boat operators have had to cease operations because lakes have dried up. In S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 the most populous city in South America and the worst hit by the drought \u2013 a year of shortages has cut water use in the city by a quarter since last January, but Jerson Kelman, the head of the main water company Sabesp, urged consumers to do more in helping the utility to \u201cprepare for the worst\u201d.     \u2018Welcome to the Cantareira desert\u2019 is written on a car which was once submerged in water, at the Atibainha dam, part of the Cantareira reservoir. Photograph: EPA    \u201cThere is a significant part of the population that is not yet aware of the seriousness of the situation and refuses to change habits,\u201d he wrote in an op-ed published on Thursday. \u201cThey must be convinced to change their behaviour.\u201d If the dry spell continues, he warned full-scale rationing would be introduced \u2013 something the city government denied would be necessary during last year\u2019s elections. At least six cities have been hit by blackouts due to weak hydroelectricity generation and high demand for air conditioning as temperatures soar over 35C. In response, utilities are burning more fossil fuels, adding to the cost of energy and greenhouse gas emissions. The government acknowledged on Thursday that Brazil is also now importing power from Argentina to try to cover the shortfall. In S\u00e3o Paulo, subway trains on one line had to be halted for more than a hour. Lights and internet have also been cut in some areas for days, causing substantial inconvenience to residents and hefty losses to businesses.

Seventeen of Brazil\u2019s 18 biggest reservoirs are at lower levels than during the last water crisis in 2001. Photograph: EPA    Agriculture is suffering with international impacts. Production of arabica coffee beans \u2013 a commodity that Brazil supplies in far greater bulk than any other country \u2013 fell 15% last year pushing up the global price of the commodity by almost half. Growers in Minas Gerais said rainfall was just 900 millimetres last year, about half its usual level. As coffee has a two-year growing cycle, the impacts will be felt next year too even if the rains return. Sugar and ethanol output has also been hit. Last week, Raizen, the country\u2019s biggest producer, announced it will lay off 250 workers and cease production at its Bom Retiro mill for two years because of cane shortages caused by the drought. Seventeen of the country\u2019s 18 biggest reservoirs are at lower levels than during the last water crisis in 2001. The southeast is worst affected. \u201cThe region has seen alarming reservoir levels since January 2014. Now in 2015, the levels are very worrying, It\u2019s a critical situation,\u201d Paulo Canedo, a water management specialist at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, said. Although the authorities hope for relief from the skies, the current rainy season has only added to concerns. In the first three weeks of January \u2013 usually the height of the season \u2013 rainfall into the main Cantareira reservoir system was less than a quarter of the average for this period. The reservoir is now down to 5.4% of its capacity, according to government monitoring stations.

Photograph: Reuters    In Rio, the four reservoirs in the Paraiba system \u2013 which supplies the main source of tap water in Rio \u2013 are at the lowest level in history \u2013 about 1%. The problem is spreading elsewhere. At least 93 cities have imposed rationing, affecting 3.9 million people. In the northeastern city of Olinda, authorities are cutting water supplies for three days a week. The shortages are affecting the poor more than anyone. Short of supplies for drinking, cooking and washing, several communities have taken to the streets to protest. Groups of residents have beaten empty buckets and cans to express their frustration in the Madureira district of Rio, which has been without tap water since before Christmas. The city of Guarapari has seen two such demonstrations. The media have reflected such frustrations. \u201cSem Luz, Sem Agua\u201d (Without Light, Without Water) ran a front-page headline in the Extra newspaper. The finger of blame has been pointed at national and local governments that have responded slowly and fallen behind in upgrades of pipes, dams and transmission lines. Waste is rife. A recent central government report showed that 37% of tap water is lost due to leaky pipes, fraud and illegal access.

Photograph: Reuters    S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s water company Sabesp has begun upgrading, but with 64,000 km of old pipes, this operation is likely to take many years. In the meantime they have extended reductions in pressure, which means many homes suffer water cuts for days on end. Water authorities counter that they are having to deal with extreme weather and rising demands from a growing and increasingly wealthy population. \u201cThere are a lot of factors behind this \u2013 rising population density, higher average temperatures increased water consumption and global warming\u201d said Ian Cardoso from CEDAE, the company responsible for water in the state of Rio. Climate change, however is denied by the country\u2019s new science minister, Aldo Rebelo, who has declared the environmental movement is \u201cnothing less, in its geopolitical essence, than the bridgehead of imperialism\u201d.     Scientists say Brazil\u2019s weather patterns have been disrupted by the loss of Amazon rainforest. Photograph: Reuters    Scientists think otherwise. As well as global warming, they say Brazil\u2019s weather patterns have been disrupted by the loss of Amazon rainforest and the growth of cities. Antonio Nobre, researcher in the government\u2019s space institute, Earth System Science Centre, told the Guardian the logging and burning of the world\u2019s greatest forest might be connected to worsening droughts \u2013 such as the one currently plaguing S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 and is likely to lead eventually to more extreme weather events. Augusto Jos\u00e9 Pereira Filho, a hydrometeorology expert at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, said the microclimate of the city was affected by population growth and urban expansion, which create a heat-island effect and reduce the amount of low cloud.

        "body": "It should be the rainy season. Instead Sao Paulo state is experiencing a third consecutive year with soaring temperatures and rainfall patterns well below historic records.  The main water reservoirs are operating at their lowest capacity. The Cantareira reservoir system, which serves more than nine million people in the state, is only 5% full. At the Alto Tiet\u00ea reservoir network, which supplies three million people in greater Sao Paulo, water levels are below 15%.  Simple calculations indicate that given the current level of consumption versus the predicted raining patterns there is only enough water on the system to last four to six months. That means the water could run out before the next rainy season starts in November. State officials recently announced a potential rationing program of five days without water and two days with, in case the February and March rains do not refill the reservoirs. This extreme climate scenario, combined with a series of management flaws, political negligence and a culture of waste and pollution, is bringing the largest metropolitan region of Brazil to the brink of collapse.  Since 2013, after decades of warnings about misguided development policies and destructive land use practices, experts and civil society organisations have been calling for increasingly strong measures to reduce water consumption to keep the minimum secure levels for supply reservoirs. The calls have been ignored by the state government \u2013 the system\u2019s main operator \u2013 and federal and municipal authorities turned a blind eye to the severity of the situation.   Related: Desperately seeking solutions to worst drought in decades in Brazil    The government took a few small steps in early 2014, such as offering a discount on water bills for people who voluntarily reduced their consumption. It also increased supply from the Billings and Guarapiranga reservoirs, but as these sources receive most of the urban waste from Sao Paulo, the water needs to be carefully tested and treated to be adequate for human consumption, adding to the complexity of securing safe water supply during the drought.  The government\u2019s main initiative has been to reduce pressure on the distribution network, so that it pumps less water through the system. As the measure was not officially recognised by leaders or the media, people were unprepared to live without drinkable water for a couple of days when the supply glitches started to happen. Taken by the population as a de facto rationing, the lack of transparency about the times and places affected by pressure reduction caused more problems and increased distrust among Sao Paulo\u2019s citizens.     The Cantareira reservoir system serving more than nine million people in Sau Paulo state is only 5% full. Photograph: Nacho Cubero/Reuters    The recovery measures adopted so far account for a 22% reduction on the water volume extracted from reservoirs. Experts, however, advise that the reduction should be around 50% to sustain the minimal conditions needed for the system.  Many might be surprised that such a scenario is happening in a tropical country famous for its abundance of natural resources, crossed by hundreds of rivers and with plenty of underground water. But for regional environmentalists and experts it comes as no surprise. They have been raising the alarm on water pollution and campaigning for watershed protection and safety standards since the 1980s. But scientific and technical reports, advocacy measures and pressures on companies were lost among the apparently unstoppable powers of real estate, agriculture and industry development. Urban land use, extensive monocultures and illegal occupation of watersheds have damaged and polluted the water production areas, jeopardising their capacity to survive and recover from extended dry seasons.   Related: Flooding in Nepal: will the economy survive the deluge?    National development policies strongly focus on macro-infrastructure plans such as large hydrodams, ports and roads, the expansion of agribusiness into the Amazon, and the predatory mining industry. These sustain the exports of soya, beef and pig iron while being responsible for the majority of Brazilian greenhouse gas emissions. More and more scientific studies show the link between deforestation in the north and the reduction of rainfall in the southeast, presenting further evidence of how the effects of climate change are already upon us. Despite the relative gains in poverty reduction over the last decade, the imminent collapse of the water supply system of the richest region in Brazil shows that basic development structures have yet to be addressed and fundamental human rights have yet to be secured in this country. Millions of people from the poorest communities have entered the consumer market, but their access to housing, sanitation, clean water, citizen security and transport remain unguarded.      A sign reading \u2018Don\u2019t jump in the water\u2019 at the dried up part of the Guarapiranga reservoir in November 2014. Photograph: Paulo Whitaker/Reuters    This is where an old clich\u00e9 becomes real: major opportunities lie within this crisis. The transcending effect of the water shortage creates a space for unity and coordination among Brazilian social movements. It offers the chance for environmental organisations to link deforestation with urban issues, to communicate that social justice will not be achieved as long as the priority is given to an unequal and unsustainable development model. Moreover, the urgency and scale of the water crisis is likely to bring NGOs and labour unions closer to the organic and youth protests that drew hundreds of thousands of people to the streets in 2013. The time and place for a solid narrative that links poverty reduction to ecological protection seems finally to have arrived. In October 2014, more than 40 NGOs, experts, independent collectives and social movements joined forces to launch the Alliance for Water, a network that is monitoring the government\u2019s response to the crisis and presenting positive solutions for surviving the probable collapse. The alliance aims to collaborate to build a new culture of water use and conservation in Sao Paulo and is producing a series of technical reports and events to qualify the debate among a wide range stakeholders, from specialists to politicians to social movements and grassroots groups.    Related: Why isn't Brazil exploiting its amazing wind capacity?    Today more than 13 million inhabitants of Sao Paulo state find themselves on the edge of an unprecedented public calamity. The absence of political leadership and government transparency fuels panic and fear. Until now, the government has not outlined a clear emergency plan to guarantee minimum water supplies for essential services such as hospitals, police stations and prisons, and for the poorest people who have no structure to store or buy mineral water. A chaotic scenario might take place where, faced with a severe and sustained lack of water, many communities will resort to polluted sources or even violence, raising significant concerns over safety and health. Civil society has a pivotal role to play by challenging development models, establishing social control over emergency plans, securing human rights and promoting the values of ethics and solidarity. As is usual in calamity situations, the most vulnerable, poorest communities are likely to pay the highest price with their health and their dignity. These people need to know they can count on organised civil society to support them across the turbulent times that lie ahead.

        "body": "Severe drought and an ailing economy have forced cities and towns across Brazil to abandon or scale back their plans for Carnival, which is due to start on Friday. In Bras\u00edlia, the capital, the local authorities have cancelled the samba school parade for the first time since 1983, in an attempt to plug the R$4bn (\u00a3900m) hole left in the accounts by the previous administration. \u201cIt was a really unpleasant surprise,\u201d said Geomar Leite, the president of Bras\u00edlia\u2019s Union of Samba Schools, said. \u201cWe had all the programme ready; the music, the costumes. We feel really frustrated.\u201d   Related: Brazil\u2019s worst drought in history prompts protests and blackouts    Even the world-famous Carnival of Rio de Janeiro is not immune. The state oil company, Petrobras, though mired in a massive corruption scandal, has promised to continue its funding of the main samba schools. But this year\u2019s street parties, known as blocos, which rely on private-sector funding, will be more modest affairs. Rita Fernandes, the president of Sebastiana, an association representing street parties in Rio\u2019s wealthy southern zone, said there had been a massive reduction in the interest of sponsors this year. \u201cWe have suffered a lot. Normally brands are desperate to be associated with us. This year that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d As a result, the organisation has had to cancel two dance events. Elsewhere in Brazil, the shortage of water is the main problem. The south-east is experiencing its worst drought in 80 years, and its two most populous states, S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais, have seen the biggest cutbacks, with 10 towns cancelling celebrations. In the town of Cordeir\u00f3polis, whose water supply has come from a mining pit for the past three months, the council issued a statement arguing that using water to clean up after the party would be \u201ceven more controversial\u201d than cancelling. In Itapecerica residents have been without running water for up to five days each week. Although supply has now been restored, Welliton Cruz, the town\u2019s tourism secretary, said the decision to cancel came after the local utility company said it could not guarantee water to the thousands of tourists that usually visit each Carnival.

The ruins of a sunken town which had remained underwater since 1969 have re-emerged, as parts of Brazil grapple with the country\u2019s worst drought in 80 years.  Photograph: Nacho Doce/Reuters    \u201cThe town approved of the decision,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though there will be a negative economic impact for the bars, the hotels and the transport sector.\u201d In the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, three hundred blocos, attracting an estimated two million, have been registered with the authorities. But with many receiving no running water for several hours each day, some question whether the city can cope. Fl\u00e1vio Pires, the president of the Association of Gastronomy, Entertainment, Art and Culture in Vila Madalena, a fashionable district in western S\u00e3o Paulo, said his members were worried. \u201cThe bars don\u2019t even have water in their toilets at night. We are having to use buckets,\u201d he said. The mayor\u2019s office has announced that street cleaners will use untreated water to wash the streets afterwards. In the sambadrome, where tens of thousands gather to watch the samba schools parade, water pressure to the bathrooms has been reduced fivefold to avoid wastage. With water rationing in effect in some places, Brazilians have been stockpiling water. But improperly covered water tanks are a fertile breeding ground for mosquitoes. Nationwide, cases of dengue fever were up 57% year-on-year this January. Now some local authorities have chosen to spend cash earmarked for street parties on disease control. Catanduva, a town 250 miles north of S\u00e3o Paulo, usually attracts 100,000 visitors to its Carnival. This year, however, a mass-spraying programme will replace the street parties.",

        "body": "The Colorado river and its tributaries took a hundred million years or two to carve the Glen Canyon out of the pink and scarlet sandstone which marks out the American southwest. Its myriad gorges, sheer cliffs and towering spires remained a largely hidden secret. Prehistoric peoples farmed part of the canyon and Navajo Indian communities built camps close to the river, but few modern Americans ventured there besides explorers until the canyon disappeared under a man-made wonder, the vast Lake Powell, with the construction of Glen Canyon dam half a century ago. Almost immediately, environmentalists and archaeologists mourned the loss. A final burst of exploration had turned up thousands of ancient ruins and drawn a belated focus on the canyon\u2019s stunning natural architecture.   Related: Washington state declares drought emergency with $1.2bn in crops at risk    \u201cGlen Canyon died in 1963,\u201d wrote the renowned conservationist David Brower, who founded Friends of the Earth. \u201cNeither you, nor I, nor anyone else knew it well enough to insist that at all costs it should endure. When we began to find out, it was too late.\u201d But Lake Powell, the US\u2019s second largest reservoir, proved its own marvel. It draws about three million tourists a year to boat, swim and take days on the water, exploring the crevices and side canyons of a lake that stretches nearly 190 miles across the border between Utah and Arizona. The otherworldly landscape of monumental rock piles and soaring sandstone cliffs has provided the backdrop for scenes in Planet of the Apes and Gravity, and for episodes of Doctor Who. After the dam was constructed at the southern tip of the canyon, the lake took more than a decade to fill with melting snow from the Rocky mountains flowing down the 1,450-mile Colorado river. That brought its own natural phenomenon. What locals nickname the \u201cbathtub ring\u201d runs for most of Lake Powell\u2019s 1,900-mile shoreline, which is half as long again as the US west coast. The ring of white calcium carbonate absorbed into the rock from the water contrasts sharply with the deep colours of the sandstone.      Glen Canyon dam, north of the rural city of Page, Arizona, has seen a dramatic drop in water levels. The levels have dropped by more than 100 feet. Photograph: Jerry Burch/Demotix for the Guardian    These days, it also provides a dramatically visible marker of the crisis facing the Colorado river after years of diminishing snowfalls on the Rockies. Month by month, as water levels fall, more of the bathtub ring is exposed. Today, it towers 100ft or more above the boaters as what federal officials are describing as the worst drought in the Colorado Basin in a century diminishes a river that provides water to 40 million people in seven states. Lake Powell \u2013 a crucial cog in the machinery of water delivery \u2013 is at only 45% of capacity. Hidden treasures The falling water level has delivered up hidden treasures, the natural arches and narrow side canyons not seen in years. Perhaps the most spectacular is the Cathedral in the Desert, a multi-coloured sandstone arch forming a huge natural amphitheatre, with a waterfall lit by narrow beams of sunlight. In parts of the lake, new islands have emerged and old ones have become towering sandstone pillars. Shores once underwater are now lined with new beaches while old ones, left high above the waterline, are bristling with plants. As the water levels dropped, some of the boating arteries linking different parts of the lake could only be kept open by cutting through the rock. Erin Janicki, an aquatic biologist, has watched the change from the water\u2019s edge. The town of Page, Arizona was built to house workers constructing the dam that flooded Glen Canyon. Janicki lives in one of the original houses, a stone\u2019s throw from the lake. For nine years, she has seen the water rise and fall, but says the overall trend is down. \u201cThe water\u2019s 110ft below the top of bathtub ring,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are parts of the lake that have pretty much become mud flats. The inlets get silted up. It takes longer to jet around the lake because some of the waterways aren\u2019t open and you have to go around obstacles.  \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of water out there, but there\u2019s been a big change. People hit rock islands all the time.\u201d For Janicki, this has raised questions about the nature of development in arid regions. \u201cI don\u2019t like seeing big developments in the desert,\u201d she said. \u201cThese cities growing all the time. More people and less water. It doesn\u2019t seem sustainable to me. Page has a golf course. Here, in the desert.\u201d The Colorado river serves Wyoming ranches, Arizona agricultural plantations and Nevada\u2019s gambling mecca, Las Vegas. It is crucial to the California food industry and growing desert cities across the southwest.   Related: California drought shaming takes on a class-conscious edge    What goes into Lake Powell is largely decided by how much snow falls on the Rockies in winter. But what comes out is governed by complex agreements made nearly a century ago, and adjusted over the years, which divvy up the river\u2019s water between seven states. Under those agreements, Lake Powell serves in part as a reservoir for the states clustered around the Colorado river\u2019s upper basin \u2013 Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico. It is also obliged to release specified amounts of water into its sister reservoir and the country\u2019s largest, Lake Mead, 180 miles downriver. Lake Mead in turn provides water to seven out of 10 Nevada residents, to a vast construct of aqueducts serving Arizona plantations and cities, and to help slate the seemingly insatiable thirst of southern California.     A small heart of cattle stand in what once was a watering hole. Photograph: Jerry Burch/Demotix for the Guardian    But after 15 years of diminishing snow falls on the Rockies, the US government agency managing the Colorado river\u2019s water, the Bureau of Reclamation, is now facing a difficult balancing act as levels in both lakes sink to record lows and rationing looms. \u201cWe all are depending on the snow pack on the Rockies and Lake Powell is the first reservoir,\u201d said Rose Davis of the Bureau of Reclamation\u2019s Upper Colorado region. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look very good. We have 56% of normal snowpack is the last reading that I saw. It\u2019s just terrible.\u201d The fall in water levels in Lake Mead are as dramatic as those in Lake Powell. It has dropped from over 90% of capacity in 2000 to less than 40%. In April, the water in Lake Mead fell to its lowest level since 1937 when it was still being filled after construction of the Hoover dam. \u201cWe are at a record low and we expect to drop even lower in the summer months,\u201d said Davis. The immediate cause is the longest drought in a century. \u201cThis 15-year drought that we\u2019re in is the worst drought in the last 100 years,\u201d said Davis. \u201cBut we also have tree-ring studies going back to the year 1075 and this is the fourth-worst drought since 1075. So the drought and weather cycles have a natural variability to them but we\u2019ve got data on warmer temperatures and climate change making a difference.  \u201cWe could get a crazy amount of snow this winter. We just don\u2019t know. We had a good year in 2011 and it\u2019s not unusual to have one good year in the middle of a drought but this is the longest one in the last 100 years.\u201d Davis said the longest drought in the Colorado Basin of the past millennia lasted more than 60 years. Water conservation as a way of life     On the Navajo reservation near Page, Arizona, a young man looks at a water reservoir fed by a windmill. Photograph: Jerry Burch/Demotix for the Guardian    The southern edge of Lake Powell marks out part of the border of the sprawling Navajo Indian reservation in Arizona. John Begay\u2019s farm sits farm sits alone just off the road south out of Page. At 74, he has watched the transformation of the canyon to a lake, and the rise and fall of the water. \u201cThere are people who talk about a drought but I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a drought or not,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t get rain like we used to in the 40s, 50s. The two best years were 1949 and 1967. After that it changed. I know it because of my animals. When there\u2019s less rain we have to collect more water. There hasn\u2019t been enough rain since I was a young man.  \u201cWe used to get a lot of snow. There\u2019s not been much since 1980. Used to get eight or 10in. Not now.\u201d All the talk of a crisis looming leaves Begay baffled. Like many people living in the sprawling, parched reservation lands, he has spent years conserving water. Seated on the worn wooden porch of the house he has lived in his entire life, he draws from a well run by the Navajo government, filling two 12,000 gallon tanks for his 45 head of beef. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a drought or not,\u201d he repeated. \u201cPeople talk about drought. The Navajo council is having meetings about this. It doesn\u2019t really change anything for us. We\u2019ve always had to be careful with water here. Look, see how dry this place is.\u201d   Related: Moronic irrigation: LA\u2019s new turf war against its sprinkler-happy celebrities    Much of the reservation is scrub, offering sparse grazing for livestock and making hard work of growing anything more than food for the family. But Begay can at least rely on the well. Others on the reservation are forced to haul every drop they use. Although he lives with his family close to one of the US\u2019s largest reservoirs, Dwight Denatsosie gets his water from a pump at the Shell petrol station in Page. He drops a handful of quarters into the machine to fill three 55-gallon drums on the back of his pickup truck. \u201cI live near Coppermine. It\u2019s real hot over there,\u201d he said. \u201cI need about 15 barrels a week. It depends on the livestock.\u201d The water is cheap but there\u2019s the cost of the fuel for the constant trips to collect it. His house, like those around it, is deemed too isolated to be on the mains. Denatsosie\u2019s brother-in-law, Leraydo Gishie, helps him collect the water. \u201cI grew up in a house with no running water and no electricity,\u201d he said. They too are wary of the idea that the present water crisis is all down to a 15-year drought. Years ago, Denatsosie\u2019s family ran a herd of livestock but the water holes they relied on dried up. One of them was filled by a pump run by a windmill. Looking into the 7ft-high holding tank next to it, there is little more than a few inches of water in the bottom. \u201cA decade ago that was full. It\u2019s not just the rain. The water isn\u2019t coming out of the ground any more,\u201d said Denatsosie. \u201cWe had to get rid of our goats and cows. It\u2019s not just the water. Without the rain, there\u2019s nothing for them to eat because nothing grows properly. Now we only have two horses.\u201d  Deeper cuts     Water on the other side of the Glen Canyon dam shows a significant drop over the years from the lack of rain.  Photograph: Jerry Burch/Demotix for the Guardian    Last year, for the first time, the amount of water transferred from Lake Powell to Lake Mead was reduced, by enough to supply about 1.5m homes. If the snowpack on the Rockies is as bad as Davis fears, then there is likely to be a deeper cut in the coming months under a series of agreements which allocate water rights. The original agreement, the Colorado River Compact, carved out nearly a century ago, divides the river\u2019s water between the states that rely on it. With hindsight, it sowed the seeds of some of today\u2019s problems. It failed to foresee the rapid rise in population in the desert states of Nevada and Arizona, and the demands of their cities and farms. Nevada, for instance, was allocated only 2% of total of the water distribution. The compact was also premised on predictions of snow packs on the Rockies which some environmentalists have concluded were based on a period of abnormally high rains in the west during the first quarter of the 20th century. The agreement gives some states greater claim than others when the water runs short. Arizona loses out, except for a county next to the Mexican border which has what are known as \u201csenior rights\u201d because it produces much of the US vegetable crop in winter. Nevada also does badly. The big winner is California, which gets to keep its much larger allocation, for a while, at least. That state of affairs can be traced back nearly half a century to construction of the largest aqueduct system in the US to deliver the Colorado\u2019s water to central and southern Arizona. The canals of the Central Arizona Project (CAP) provide water to cities such as Tucson and Phoenix, and irrigate close to 400,000 hectares (1m acres) of farmland. Without it, Arizona would be less fertile and, probably, less inhabited. But the CAP required the support of California\u2019s members of Congress to win funding and they exacted a price \u2013 if the water is rationed, Arizona\u2019s allocation is cut by half before California takes any hit at all. In 2007, seven years into the present drought, new allocations were signed by the US secretary of the interior in case the water shortages grew. The cutbacks to the states kicks in if Lake Mead falls below 1,075ft.  In April of this year it was just 4ft short of that benchmark as it fell to its lowest level since 1937, when the lake was still being filled. If the water levels continue to drop, Arizona and Nevada will face immediate cuts, escalating as the lake falls further. That would threaten cities such as Las Vegas and the very existence farms fed by the Arizona aqueduct. If the lake sinks below 1,000ft, the water intake pipes would start sucking air. The Hoover Dam power turbines would also stop spinning, interrupting an important source of electricity to the region. Davis said it\u2019s a prospect that kicked state governments into gear. \u201cWe signed these guidelines in 2007, so all of the states have been very proactive in storing groundwater, implementing conservation measures, using recycling technologies. They have seen this coming,\u201d she said. Nevada is recycling most of the water used by residents and tourists in Las Vegas. The Southern Nevada Water Authority put in place a conservation plan that includes limiting the size of lawns, restrictions on watering gardens and campaigns to shorten the time spent in showers or running dishwashers. The authority says it has reduced demand from about 314 gallons per person per day in 2002 to about 205 gallons per day last year, and saved 32bn gallons of water despite the region\u2019s population rising by more than 500,000 people.   Related: Drought forces California into first mandatory rules to save water    California has been implementing a raft of measures, with new laws to come, to deal with a water crisis across the state beyond areas dependent on the Colorado river. Arizona has cut back water usage to levels last seen in the 1950s. If it comes to it, the state has had to set its own priorities. The cities will get first call over the farmers of central Arizona. Arizona also stashed surplus water in the years of plenty in underground water banks which should provide it with about two years of reserves, although it is a major operation to extract it. But all of that looks a relative sticking plaster next to the predictions made by some environmental studies that the Colorado river\u2019s flow is permanently diminished. Some predict the volume of water coming off the Rocky mountains will fall by a further third by 2050. It\u2019s not just what is on the surface that\u2019s of concern. With less water coming off the mountains, farmers and local municipalities began drilling down to tap into the Colorado Basin\u2019s aquifers. A study by the University of California, Irvine using Nasa satellites found that over the decade to the end of 2013, the Colorado basin lost 65 cubic kilometres, or 17 trillion gallons, of water \u2013 more than double the capacity of Lake Mead. The study describes water from the Colorado River Basin as the \u201cmost over allocated in the world\u201d.  \u201cQuite honestly, we are alarmed and concerned about the implications of our findings,\u201d wrote one of the study\u2019s authors, Jay Famiglietti. \u201cFrom a group that studies groundwater depletion in the hottest of the hot spots of water stress around the world \u2013 in India, the Middle East, and in California\u2019s Central Valley \u2013 that says something.\u201d",

        "body": "The last time Nguyen Van Viet saw water in his well was almost four months ago. The 44-year-old has farmed coffee in central Vietnam for two decades and says that\u2019s never happened before. \u201cThis is the worst drought I\u2019ve seen in over a decade,\u201d Viet, told the Guardian. \u201cSome people don\u2019t have enough water to drink.\u201d For Viet and millions of other coffee farmers, this season has been disastrous. A prolonged drought has affected all five provinces in Vietnam\u2019s Central Highlands \u2013 a region that produces 60% of the country\u2019s coffee. \u201cNormally, in March or April, it should start rain, but this year it hasn\u2019t rained until now,\u201d Viet said. \u201cOver the years I\u2019ve realised it\u2019s getting harder to grow coffee mostly because lack of water. The temperatures are getting higher and higher and the rainfall is less.\u201d  Viet says he\u2019s lost almost 4,000 sq meters of coffee crops on his five-acre farm in Dak Lak, a province responsible for 30% of total coffee harvests last year. At least 7,000 acres of coffee plants have died there since March, according to the provincial Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. And in neighbouring Lam Dong Province, the drought has stressed another 150,000 acres of coffee.  The result has been a five-year low in coffee exports, 40% down on the same period in 2014. The economic costs have yet to be tallied.  Vietnam is the world\u2019s largest producer of Robusta, a tougher, more bitter bean often used in instant coffee and espresso. The French introduced the plant in the 19th century and in the post-war years it helped pull millions of Vietnamese from poverty. The industry grew rapidly in the 1990s, making Vietnam the world\u2019s second-largest exporter of coffee and supplying around a quarter of the UK\u2019s coffee.  But success came at a cost. Deforestation, monocropping and intensive pesticide use that helped create the boom now leaves coffee farms more vulnerable to climate change.  \u201cCoffee cultivation in Vietnam goes hand-in-hand with deforestation, land degradation and depletion of water resources,\u201d says a 2012 report from the Initiative for Climate and Coffee. \u201cThe resilience of coffee monoculture production systems to soil erosion, increasing evapotranspiration, drought periods or devastating extreme weather events is very low.\u201d Since 1960, the average annual temperature in Vietnam has increased by 0.4C . And the average number of hot days has also increased.  Climate change projections suggest an average temperature rise of 2.3C by 2100, according to the United Nations. The number of hot days in the Central Highlands is expected to increase to 134 in 2050 and 230 in 2100. Even though Robusta is more tolerant of higher temperatures than Arabica, temperature rise could damage plant development.  \u201cIf the temperature really goes beyond the flowering threshold, we get flowering abortion and we\u2019re going to have a serious problem,\u201d said Dave D\u2019Haeze, an environmental consultant with the Hanns R Neumann Foundation.     Local residents pass a dried channel at Thanh Phu District of Ben Tre province in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam. The region is the most vulnerable location in Vietnam to impacts of climate change. Photograph: VNA/Corbis    But the main problem in Vietnam now is water. Rainfall in Dak Lak Province is 86% less compared to this time last year. In Lam Dong, reservoirs are one meter lower than last year, according to the provincial Bureau of Water Resource Management.  Expansion of coffee farms in recent years has added stress to an already limited water supply. \u201cThe biggest factor for vulnerability is dependency on water for irrigation,\u201d Kerstin Linne a consultant who has studied Vietnam\u2019s coffee supply chain. \u201cFarmers are using up groundwater and levels are already declining. With increasing temperatures, therefore increasing evapotranspiration and changes in rainfalls pressure on water levels will increase. However, so far many farmers over-irrigate as water is free and they do not know how much water they use.\u201d  Although climate change projections for Vietnam suggest more rain in the wet season, there may be 20% less rainfall in the drier months, according to the UN. D\u2019Haeze is working with coffee farmers on an experiment to determine the right amount of water to use. Government guidelines suggest 400 to 500 litres of water per plant, per watering, but D\u2019Haeze thinks it could be much less, around 350 litres.  \u201cAt the moment we know we are using far too much water,\u201d D\u2019Haeze said. \u201cSo if everybody is using the right amount of water at the right time, we might be able to have enough during the dry season.\u201d",

        "body": "This week Penny Button will do something no one in her family, in more than a century on the land, has even had to contemplate: she will sell every last cow in her possession.  Button\u2019s Crossmoor property lies on the Thomson river just outside of Longreach, the outback Queensland town hardest hit by the state\u2019s most widespread drought on record.  Crossmoor may be just the latest in a long line of family-run cattle operations in this district to be forced to fully \u201cdestock\u201d. It\u2019s wise to preserve country and sell stock while they\u2019re still in good shape. But that makes it no easier for Button. Selling up is made all the harder by the fact it means the end of the continuous bloodline of Santa Gertrudis bulls and calves imported years ago by her father-in-law, Viv Button. \u201cThat\u2019s 60 years of genetics gone \u2013 that will take years to get back,\u201d Button tells Guardian Australia from the deck of her homestead.  The majestic tin-and-timber house, more than a century old and grandly proportioned, is set in an oasis of trees. Beyond the green, the desiccated country all around can just be glimpsed. It is not the end of the line for Button as a farmer. But it is the beginning of the kind of extraordinary hiatus that drought inflicts on farming families in this region. Here families are forced to make do with virtually no income when the drought hits hard. This is the kind of hunkering down that can either prove a farmer\u2019s resilience to herself, or sadly push those whom Button describes as the \u201cgentler souls\u201d to breaking point. \u201cMy attitude is that the captain goes down with the sinking ship and you never give up,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re dealt a hand and at the end of the day it\u2019s up to you. I would hate to see generations of hard work just lost.\u201d  In these times you live on borrowed money. You keep the banks at bay by paying the interest on your loan. You live like a miser. And you wait for rain, if not this summer or the next. You wait for the grass to grow again, so you can buy back the bones of a new herd. Then you hope that in two years\u2019 time you will have something to take to market and income will be a part of your life again. So this is not unprecedented, a farmer selling her stock. But this drought is now unprecedented in scale \u2013 affecting a record 80%-plus of the state, or nearly 1.5m sq km \u2013 and its impact on one of Australia\u2019s rural heartlands is building. While the \u201cmillennium drought\u201d ran for the better part of eight years up to 2009, no individual region suffered more than two failed summers in a row. Now the spectre of a fourth dry summer is looming in places such as Longreach and the paralysing effect on the state\u2019s $1.2bn-a-year livestock trade is provoking deep concern. Can the outback communities that survive largely on beef and wool money survive this?     A sheep skull lies at the edge of a dry dam on the property Rio Station in Longreach.  Photograph: Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images    The sale of Button\u2019s remaining herd this week could be the family\u2019s last source of cash flow from cattle for a year or more. Crossmoor lies off a dirt road about 70km north of Longreach, the self-styled \u201cgateway to the outback\u201d. Longreach, about 1,100km north-west of Brisbane, is a magnet for \u201cgrey nomads\u201d, middle-aged travellers passing through on caravan odysseys. Backpackers from Paris and London on working holidays pull beers at the local pubs. The funk of animals held in trucks and train carriages lingers on the edge of town. The sun is scorching even in winter. Bureau of Meteorology figures indicate Longreach and its surrounds are suffering worst of all in the current drought. There have been drier places over the past two years, namely the perennially parched Birdsville and Boulia on the fringes of Australia\u2019s red-desert centre. But in Longreach just 312mm of rain fell in the 24 months to April \u2013 64% below its long-term average. Thus Longreach appears \u201cthe town that is furthest below normal\u201d, according to Blair Trewin of the bureau\u2019s climate-monitoring section. A local agriculture department expert, David Phelps, says while Longreach folk may not be aware of the statistics, a visit by the prime minister, Tony Abbott, (who copped a serve in the Longreach Leader newspaper for failing to cover up with a broad-brimmed hat) was enough to indicate they were at the \u201cfair dinkum epicentre of the drought\u201d. The warnings over climate change raise the prospect of more frequent and prolonged droughts like this. But the stoic attitude of many farmers to this kind of future is typified in the views of another Longreach grazier, Phillip Owens: \u201cWe certainly live in an arid part of Australia and we have come to expect floods and famines. Climate\u2019s certainly continually changing and I don\u2019t think we can ignore the science behind it. For whatever reason it is what it is and we\u2019ve just got to learn to cope with it.\u201d Owens and his wife Lyn de-stocked their property Dundee some time ago. In fact only a smattering of beasts remains throughout the entirety of this famed cattle and wool district, which lies almost exactly at the centre of Queensland. From the air, the plains around Longreach are now a patchwork of burnt orange and charcoal swirls. The orange is the dirt, the swirls are patches of native Mitchell grass, dead or dying as roots two metres deep grasp vainly for water.     A dam bottoms out on a cattle property in Longreach. Just 312mm of rain fell in Longreach in the 24 months to April 2015 \u2013 64% below its long-term average. Photograph: Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images    In better times, the Mitchell grass serves as what a stock management consultant, Desiree Jackson, describes as \u201cmeat and potatoes\u201d for cattle on the plains. Two and a half years of no rain to speak of has reduced the grass to dark stubble with the nutritional value of cardboard. Only winter rain can spark the growth of \u201cherbages\u201d, which Jackson says is like \u201cice cream\u201d for cattle.  Not that there will be anything much apart from kangaroos to enjoy the ice cream. Kangaroos, the symbol of Qantas, the national airline born in Longreach, are regarded as pests by local farmers who can see the quick-breeding marsupials wipe out their cattle fodder before they can even get hoofs back to pasture. Jackson says the shotgun remains the most humane method available of controlling the kangaroos. A farmer might gain a permit to shoot 1,000.  For now, many kangaroos are dropping dead of thirst and hunger around Longreach\u2019s drier parts. But Button estimates there are at least 10,000 on Crossmoor alone, where they can avail themselves of what Button describes as \u201can abundance of beautiful bore water from the Great Artesian Basin\u201d. But no amount of water infrastructure can provide enough irrigation to revive the Mitchell grass on an 80,000 hectare property. For that, the heavens are required. Showing how quickly fortunes can turn, Button says 2013, owing to rain the previous year, was \u201cstill quite a good year\u201d. There has been no rainfall of note since then. Button, who has herself run cattle properties since 1971, has never encountered a dry like this. At the beginning of 2014, she had 1,800 breeding cows. Within months the family made the decision to get them all off the property into agistment \u2013 paying to graze them on greener routes elsewhere. Another dry summer has forced their hand. Last Thursday they sold \u201cpreg-tested\u201d breeders and trucked them away. This week they will muster their final 500 cows and calves in two sweeps of Crossmoor.     Cattle at a molasses supplement feed station at a drought-hit property in Longreach. Photograph: Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images    Button took over the property in 1991 with her husband, Ian, from a partnership that included a Brisbane chemist. They had run a cattle and sheep operation 20 years earlier on a property called Welford, further to the south-west near Windorah. It was drier but more provident country for grazing, Button says. They lived in a formidable mud-brick abode which featured built-in shooting vantage points \u2013 relics of an earlier time of warfare between white settlers on the frontier and the dispossessed Indigenous people of south-west Queensland. The founding property owner, Richard Welford, the son of an English barrister, was murdered by an Indigenous employee while building cattle yards in the 1880s.  The couple shifted the Crossmoor homestead from near the front entrance to the property just off the road to a hill 8km back. Button wryly recalls the blunt country humour her husband invoked at the time: \u201cYou don\u2019t want your house near the main road. People might steal your tools and take your wife. Then you\u2019d need to lock up your tools.\u201d Since Ian\u2019s death in 2006, it is his wife who runs the whole operation with her son Hugh and his bride Amanda.  Dressed in a white T-shirt and jeans, Button has a worldly, cultivated air and an eye for aesthetics. \u201cI am determined to have a standard of lifestyle here that people can have in the city, a nice house and garden, and whatnot,\u201d she says. The hallway in her homestead is the size of many city living rooms. \u201cThe old boys were pretty generous,\u201d Button says.  The magnificent home and the outdoor adventures that beckon beyond it make up what she says is \u201ca lovely life, and a lovely life for kids\u201d. The family loves to have friends visit, especially with children from the city. Button\u2019s rose bushes are a casualty of the big dry but the grass lawn stands up still to the salt of bore water. The pool remains full. The homestead once hosted a dozen employees who worked the property. A long wooden table on the veranda that Button dug out for a dinner party \u2013 once used to feed all those men \u2013 is a relic from that past. Now the farm is run by the most efficient unit imaginable: a three-person crew of Button, Hugh and Amanda. Asked about running Crossmoor, an 32,000 hectare expanse with its boundaries stretching up to 20km from the house, Button jokes: \u201cIt\u2019s just a little place, this one.\u201d Welford was four times the size. Button concedes that were the money there for it, more workers would be welcome. \u201cIdeally we\u2019d like to have a bit more of a hand because we just don\u2019t draw breath,\u201d she says.  \u201cWe still have a lovely life but there\u2019s lots of weekends we do a lot of work. We spend an enormous amount of time on maintenance. Fences, yards, vehicles, motorbikes, it all needs maintenance.\u201d Graziers like Button can expect at best around $2.20 a kilogram for every beast of theirs that winds up in a meatworks. At the other end of the supply chain, a punter buying a steak in a restaurant in Brisbane would easily pay the equivalent of $160 a kilogram. Like all graziers, Button wonders where the margin goes in between.  \u201cWe\u2019re probably bad businessmen,\u201d she says, adding that hardly any of this class of \u201cprice takers\u201d competes among themselves. But she says: \u201cWe\u2019re very independent. I wouldn\u2019t want to live anywhere else.\u201d Asked if a life of physical work keeps her young, she replies, amused: \u201cWell I don\u2019t know. Sometimes I don\u2019t think so. But the doctor told me I was in the top 30% of my age the other day. I was pretty chuffed about that.\u201d Button oversees the musters herself from the cockpit of her Cessna light aircraft, performing a role filled in times past by four men on horseback. She normally relishes the experience, which begins in the \u201cearly morning daylight\u201d.     Another day begins in Longreach, with the sun set to scorch the earth once more. Photograph: Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images    \u201cThe weather is just ideal as far as the coolness, the clear morning, it\u2019s just perfection,\u201d she says. \u201cWith me the only person in the plane, the plane flies so easily. Because you\u2019re not in a built-up area, it\u2019s very relaxing, there\u2019s not too much radio procedure. And if you have a visitor that comes in a plane, they can just taxi up to the back door. That\u2019s pretty nice.\u201d Spotting the cattle from overhead, Button relays positions to Hugh and Amanda on the ground on their motorbikes, who bring in the beasts with the help of a team of six kelpies. Though some graziers\u2019 children are discouraged from staying on the land, Hugh chose at 21 to give up life as a builder in Brisbane to return to the family farm. Through him, Button can see past the drought to the continuation of the family\u2019s life on the land. \u201cHe\u2019s keen as mustard and it\u2019s just wonderful he wants to do that,\u201d Button says. \u201cHugh\u2019s a new-wave grazier, well-educated, fresh and modern ideas, and can see a real future on the land.\u201d Unprecedented though the drought may be, Button says it was one of the \u201cforeseeable\u201d factors for graziers. \u201cSomehow we have to all just suck it up.\u201d But an unforeseeable event, the Gillard government\u2019s banning of the live cattle trade in 2011 after revelations of cruelty in Indonesian abattoirs, was one of many factors contributing to a perfect storm conspiring against the rural economy, Button says. The influx of those beasts to domestic markets reduced prices by about a third, limiting returns at a time when farmers were trying to bounce back from the \u201cmillennium drought\u201d \u2013 and unknowingly on the verge of something worse. David Phelps says three-quarters of the Mitchell grass is likely to be dead. The rest could take two summers to recover, assuming the rain comes. For the plains around Longreach to have taken on this hue of \u201cdeathly grey\u201d for more than two years is uncharted territory, he says.    Most people have become very resilient \u2013 they have to be. It is an amazing feature of rural people  Penny Button     Some graziers thought they were \u201cdrought-proofing\u201d themselves by buying properties as far apart as Mount Isa and Longreach, Phelps says. But the breadth of this drought has put paid to that. Those who expanded through bank loans when the last drought broke \u201cdidn\u2019t get to breed or trade their way out\u201d, he says.  Mark McGovern, an economist at the Queensland University of Technology, says the willingness of banks to lend during an outback property boom made for a \u201ctextbook\u201d subprime mortgage crisis. As property values drop, triggering loan-to-valuation ratios that prompt banks to step in, a handful of graziers in Longreach and more elsewhere have gone to the wall. Button is confident her family farm, now stripped of its productive income, has the ability to pull through. Her sympathy goes out to the others who, having overextended financially in a forlorn attempt to expand, will find it harder to survive.  The Queensland Liberal National party senator Barry O\u2019Sullivan says he expects more farms to fall and he sees moral hazard in an attempt by government to save them. Locals talk of banks already sizing up repossessions even as a moratorium on seizures is under way. Some see glimmers of consolation. Phelps says family operations that have voluntarily given up income by unloading their cattle have made the right choice, allowing land the time to properly recover. Longreach in the 1960s was \u201cby all reports a dust bowl\u201d, when drought-stricken farmers allowed cattle to eat up virtually every last stalk of grass, he says. Button says she feels \u201cboth sides of politics\u201d have let rural Australia down. She says the absence of any real plan to develop outback Queensland \u2013 the last major dam being five decades ago \u2013 overshadows any number of drought-relief loan schemes of dubious value to savvy rural operators with an eye on horizons longer than five years. But Button says it is inevitably the graziers\u2019 responsibility to put enough away in good times to hold on in the droughts they know will always come. If nothing else, droughts could be an opportunity for a farmer normally bound by the routine of working the land to \u201cgo away and do something else, like take a holiday\u201d, she says. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t get too consumed by it,\u201d she says. \u201cMost people have become very resilient \u2013 they have to be. \u201cIt is an amazing feature of rural people. People are determined to survive and determined to make the best of the situation. Resilience comes with time and because people have to be. But that is easier for some than others.\u201d",

        "body": "  Related: Brazil drought: water rationing alone won't save Sao Paulo    Every inhabited continent, to varying degrees, has areas where there is extremely high water stress. These are areas where more than 80% of the local water supply is withdrawn by businesses, farmers, residents and other consumers every year.  These so-called stressed areas are also the ones most vulnerable to episodic droughts. With chronic overuse of water resources, it only takes a string of years with bad rainfall or poor management decisions to plunge a region into crisis and chaos. Here\u2019s a look at seven extreme droughts that have occurred in the past decade.     Map of water stress around the world Photograph: WRI    Australia\u2019s one-in-a-thousand-year drought Australia\u2019s \u201cmillennium\u201d drought began in 1995 and continued country-wide until late 2009. Reservoir levels fell precipitously, as did crop production and industrial water use. A number of cities, including Melbourne, Sydney and Perth, built desalination plants in an effort to partially drought-proof themselves, while other areas pursued grey-water recycling projects. Between 2001 and 2012 the federal government provided $4.5 billion in assistance to drought-affected farmers and small businesses. In 2010 and 2011, following quickly on the heels of the drought, Australia experienced its worst flooding in half a century, as an area of Queensland larger than the size of France and Germany flooded, affecting 200,000 people and costing at least $10 billion in damage. Spain imports water by ship Drought in Spain\u2019s north-eastern region of Catalonia grew so severe in 2008 that Barcelona began importing water by ship from France. About 70% of Spain\u2019s water goes to agriculture, and much of it is wasted through a combination of inefficient irrigation systems and water-thirsty crops unsuitable for the arid climate.  Other critics say low water prices are the culprits as they result in profligate water use and low investment in water-efficient infrastructure. Northern India\u2019s groundwater loss can be seen from space     Water stress in India map Photograph: WRI    Twin satellites from Nasa\u2019s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (Grace) are able to detect changes in the Earth\u2019s gravity field brought about by changes in the way water is distributed, including in groundwater storage. Nowhere on Earth are groundwater declines greater than in northern India; Nasa found that large-scale irrigation caused 108 cubic km of groundwater loss in Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Delhi between 2002 and 2008. The study\u2019s lead, Matt Rodell, observed that \u201cthe region has become dependent on irrigation to maximise agricultural productivity. If measures are not taken to ensure sustainable groundwater usage, the consequences for the 114 million residents of the region may include a collapse of agricultural output and severe shortages of potable water\u201d. In July 2012, roughly half of India\u2019s population \u2013 about 670 million people or 10% of the world\u2019s population \u2013 temporarily lost power following a massive grid failure. Some experts laid the blame on the severe drought affecting northern India. Low rainfall restricted the amount of power delivered by hydroelectric dams, and farmers used more power than usual to run water pumps to irrigate their crops.   Related: Farmers versus big business: the politics of irrigation in Tanzania    The dark side of China\u2019s boom Much of northern China is relatively dry \u2013 not unlike California and the rest of the western United States \u2013 yet it has also traditionally produced significant amounts of wheat and other grains thanks to flood irrigation. Add skyrocketing water use by industry, energy and municipalities to this inefficient system and hydrologists warn that China\u2019s future is in danger of drying up.  Government officials are starting to take action. Water is now one of China\u2019s public policy priorities, and the central government recently launched a \u201cthree red lines\u201d policy to improve efficient water use and to place caps on water demand. Yet it remains unclear whether these policies are sufficient to overcome the country\u2019s vast water challenges. Mesopotamian nightmare From 2006 through 2011, Syria suffered its worst drought and crop failure in recorded history. The Grace satellite data revealed \u201can alarming rate of decrease in total water storage in the Tigris and Euphrates river basins, which [at the time] had the second fastest rate of groundwater storage loss on Earth, after India\u201d. While many other factors \u2013 political, social and religious \u2013 have contributed to the Syrian military conflict, experts argue that \u201cthe decrease in water availability, water mismanagement, agricultural failures, and related economic deterioration contributed to population dislocations and the migration of rural communities to nearby cities. These factors further contributed to urban unemployment, economic dislocations, food insecurity for more than a million people, and subsequent social unrest\u201d. South-eastern Brazil on the brink     In Brazil \u201cwater refugees\u201d are fleeing cities such as S\u00e3o Paulo and there is talk of bringing in the military if the drought grows worse. Photograph: WRI    Parts of south-eastern Brazil, including the cities of S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte, are struggling through the worst drought in 84 years, with 40 million people and the nation\u2019s economic powerhouse at risk. Reservoirs supplying water to these cities are at dangerously low levels. They\u2019re also highly polluted. Unfortunately, politicians have failed to act decisively to take steps to minimise the impact of the crisis, raising levels of public distrust and frustration. There has even been talk of \u201cwater refugees\u201d leaving the cities, and bringing in the military to help out if matters grow worse. Turning now to California California is in the throes of an unprecedented drought, now in its fourth year. Governor Jerry Brown ordered mandatory restrictions on water use by state municipalities early last month, and a group of farmers have since given up a quarter of their water rights this year in exchange for being spared deeper mandatory cuts. The situation is bad, even desperate for some farmers. As I argued in a recent blog, the state needs to improve its water governance in order to protect its economic interests and its citizens. The situation is poised to worsen Forthcoming projections for global water stress in 2020, 2030 and 2040 by WRI\u2019s Aqueduct project indicate that the global water picture is likely going to get worse over the next few decades. Larger populations and growing economies demand more water and in some places climate change will likely reduce available water supply. While our vulnerability to drought grows, the incidence of extreme weather events, including drought, will grow as well, according to most climate change experts.   Related: Getting water where it's needed: will the Lisbon Charter help?    In this knowledge lies power. We know that drought risk is high and growing worldwide. We\u2019re already seeing the impact that water scarcity has on citizens, on the environment and on economies. Sustainable water management plans, clear government monitoring and management policies and wise natural and engineered infrastructure investments could have helped to shore up the dwindling water supply, alleviating impacts on people, planet and economy. It\u2019s time to put this information into action. Businesses, governments and all water managers must quickly and intelligently take measures to reduce vulnerability to droughts.

        "body": " A surprise five-minute rain shower falls like a taunt over the scorched riverbed of the Rancher\u00eda river: fat raindrops spatter in the dust but evaporate almost immediately. Nearby, a young girl and boy scoop out a bowlful of cloudy groundwater from a makeshift well to wash a few scraps of clothes.   Related: Taluorumana, the Colombian village dying of thirst \u2013 in pictures    The Rancher\u00eda river has run dry after three years of intense drought, decades of overuse and a lifetime of public corruption in the province of La Guajira, one of Colombia\u2019s poorest and most forgotten regions. Crops have long ago shrivelled, babies are dying of malnutrition and livestock are wasting away from thirst.  It was for times like this that the El Cercado dam was built on the river, to mitigate the effects of cyclical droughts in the region, home to the Wayuu Indians. At the entrance to the El Cercado dam, a huge billboard pronounces \u201cFrom here will flow the water that will be the future to the Guajira.\u201d  The original project foresaw the dam supplying water to the aqueducts of nine municipalities as well as providing irrigation for agriculture. But the massive pipes that should have made this possible lead nowhere. \u201cThey never connected it to anything,\u201d said Octavio Calder\u00f3n of the provincial potable water office.  The reservoir currently stands at 40% of its capacity and local authorities are controlling the flow of the river past the dam to ensure the supply. But the flow hardly makes it past the rice fields, cattle ranches and the world\u2019s largest open-pit coalmine that tap into the river below the dam. By the time it reaches the middle Guajira, where the population is mostly Wayuu, the Rancher\u00eda is barely even a trickle.      Esteffany Epieyu, 11, and her nephew Luis Miguel wash clothes in the dry riverbed. Photograph: Stephen Ferry for the Guardian    \u201cThere is a lot of demand on the river and very little control over how it\u2019s used,\u201d said Calder\u00f3n.  Javier Rojas, leader of an indigenous association called Wayuu Shipia, puts it more bluntly: \u201cThe Wayuu are dying of thirst and hunger because of the dam,\u201d he said.  According to official figures, 26 children died of malnutrition in La Guajira in 2013, 48 in 2014 and 11 in the first six months of 2015. But Rojas says the actual numbers are far higher. He says he has verified the death of at least 25 children since February, and calculates that at least 400 children have died in the past three years. \u201cI get weekly reports of the death of at least three children,\u201d he said.  The latest such report came from a village known as Hirt\u00fa. On 6 June, a two-month-old child, Chepe Uriana, died after receiving treatment for malnutrition at hospital and being sent home with his mother to their village just seven kilometres from the town of Manaure.  \u201cA significant number of boys and girls, mostly Wayuu, have died in La Guajira from perfectly preventable causes,\u201d the country\u2019s human rights ombudsman\u2019s office said in a 2014 report.      Paola Uriana, 17, sits with her daughter Sara Sof\u00eda Uriana, 7 months, in the Centre for Nutritional Recuperation. Photograph: Stephen Ferry for the Guardian    Thousands more are barely surviving. In the village of Nuevo Ambiente, a young girl dribbles a cup of water over the head of her brother, who sits in a plastic tub under the shade of a open-walled thatch-roof hut. David is three years old, but has not yet learned to walk or talk. Stunted by severe malnutrition, he weighs just 6.7kg and wears diapers normally worn by a five-month-old infant. It means he\u2019s improving, according to his grandmother, Alcira Epiey\u00fa. Until a few months ago, he was wearing diapers for a newborn.  Rosa is another survivor. For the past two weeks, she and her mother Aines have been at the Centre for Nutritional Recovery in the Guajira capital, Riohacha, run by the child welfare agency. She looks like an infant of about six months but Aines says she\u2019s a year and four months old, her growth stunted by a lack of food and clean water in their village in the upper Guajira. Aines says doctors have told her the water they pull from a well is not safe to drink. \u201cBut what can we do if there\u2019s no other water?\u201d she asks as she cradles Rosa in her arms.    Colombia map   Wayuu leaders have now taken their case for water to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, requesting precautionary measures aiming to force the local and national government to ensure their access to water.  \u201cWe asked for the commission to order the floodgates of the dam to be opened, and that the Wayuu should be given priority in the use of the water. Any surplus can then be used for economic activities,\u201d says lawyer Carolina S\u00e1chica, director of the legal clinic at the Tadeo Lozano University in Bogot\u00e1, who petitioned the commission on behalf of the Wayuu.  One of the largest single users of the river water is the Cerrej\u00f3n coalmine, jointly owned by BHP Billiton plc, Anglo American plc and Xstrata Coal. On average, the mine uses 2,700 cubic metres per day of water, drawing both surface flow from the river and groundwaterfrom wells, said company spokesman Carlos Franco, who added that the mine is using just 16% of the river water it is authorised to use.  \u201cThe problem is not our use, the problem is they have not built the pipelines for the aqueducts,\u201d said Franco. \u201cThe money for the aqueducts in La Guajira has been stolen over and over again.\u201d      Flamini G\u00f3mez Uriana carries water from a well to the the little settlement of Talorumana. Photograph: Stephen Ferry for the Guardian    Alejandro Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, the inspector general, whose office investigates accusations of corruption and mismanagement by public servants, said on a visit to Guajira last year that the real problem in the department is corruption.  \u201cThe main problem of the region is not the drought but corruption because royalties have been stolen for many years and the public works needed to face natural events that are foreseeable were not done,\u201d Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez said.  On 1 June President Juan Manuel Santos travelled to the region to address the water issue. He made no mention of the El Cercado dam and the aqueducts it was supposed to feed, but he promised 100 new wells for the province by 2018.  The Wayuu have heard those promises before.  For now Lilia Uriana relies on dreams to find water. From atop the windswept hill where she and her family live in a collection of mud huts and thatched-roof stalls, she can see two jagueyes \u2013 traditional reservoirs dug by Wayuu communities to catch rainwater, when it comes. But the earth of the jagueyes surrounding her village of Taluorumana is cracked dry. It was her mother who dreamed last year of a certain spot where, if she left a necklace for the spirits, they would provide water. A 10-metre-deep well at the site has been serving as the family\u2019s source for water ever since. The water at the bottom is brackish and slightly oily. \u201cBut it\u2019s what we have,\u201d said Uriana. ",

        "body": "India Across large swaths of the Thar desert in western India, traditional techniques for harvesting the little amount of rain that falls has helped people survive the powerful effects of the sun for centuries. The most beautiful of these are step wells \u2013 known as baolis in Hindi \u2013 large, stone structures built to provide water for drinking and agriculture. Baolis have existed for at least 1,000 years and were constructed in towns and alongside serais (travellers\u2019 inns), across the desert and into Delhi.   Related: Decade of drought: a global tour of seven recent water crises    Baolis exist in all shapes and sizes and are essentially reservoirs built into the earth. Groundwater is pulled up from a circular well at the bottom and rainwater is collected from above. A set of steps \u2013 on one or more sides of the structure \u2013 lead down to the water level, which fluctuates depending on the amount of rain. More recently, electric pumps have been installed in many baolis to help retrieve the water. \u201cStep wells are etched into people\u2019s collective memory so deeply, they are now part of their DNA, passed on from one generation to another,\u201d says Farhad Contractor of the Sambhaav Trust, an ecological conservation group. Today, many baolis have fallen prey to rapid urbanisation and neglect. In Delhi only around 15 survive but local groups are fighting to protect and preserve them. While 700mm of rain falls on Delhi every year, half of the city has been declared a dark zone \u2013 where the groundwater level has depleted so much that the rate of recharge is less than the rate of withdrawal \u2013 by the groundwater authority. Rainwater harvesting, therefore, is key to a secure water supply for India\u2019s second-biggest city.     Workers carry out conservation work at Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliyas baoli in New Delhi. Photograph: Anindito Mukherjee/EPA    One such baoli restored by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC) was built in the 14th century in Hazrat Nizamuddin Basti, a medieval village in Delhi named after Sufi saint, Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya. In 2008, parts of the baoli walls collapsed due to sewage water seeping into the structure and the local residents using it as a rubbish dump. The pool was drained and the rubbish, garbage and sludge that had accumulated over the past 700 years was removed to reach the foundation of the baoli some 80 feet below ground level. While the water in the baoli is still not potable, it can be used for cleaning and agriculture. Experts say the baoli model can be replicated anywhere in the world with similar climatic conditions and physiological features. Contractor has been invited to Morocco where he is working on a project to build baolis and smaller wells, known as beris in Hindi. But large baolis need large catchment areas, and in Delhi space is an issue. While the majority of the physical structures of baolis are protected \u2013 some by being sited inside historic monuments \u2013 urban development in Delhi has had a greater impact on their water levels; storm drains divert rain away from baoli catchment areas. Diwan Singh, an activist with non-profit Natural Heritage First, says that even though many baolis in Delhi are surrounded by buildings, the wells can still be recharged. \u201cCatchment area management is the key. In the small areas of land between the baolis and buildings, rainwater harvesting pits could be built to divert rainwater away from the storm drains,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce in the pit, water will percolate through the soil and recharge the nearby baoli, allowing modern development and ancient structures to co-exist side by side.\u201d Nivedita Khandekar Kenya     The construction of a sand dam involves building a concrete barrier or wall across a seasonal river. Photograph: Geoffrey Kamadi    Makueni County \u2013 just over 100 miles south of Nairobi \u2013 has one of the most inhospitable environments in the country.    Related: Access to clean water and sanitation around the world \u2013 mapped    The region\u2019s sandy loam soil supports little else besides the thorny, stunted shrubs that stretch for miles, interspersed only by gigantic baobab trees or some species of the hardy acacia. The only food crops cultivated here are sorghum, cassava and pigeon peas \u2013 drought-tolerant crops. With an average annual rainfall of just 600mm, meaningful agriculture is nearly impossible. Water access is a big problem. In Kenya, 63% of the population use an improved source of drinking water and 46% live below the poverty line. Women and girls in sub-Saharan Africa spend up to four hours a day fetching water, according to the One campaign. But things are changing for the better, thanks to an ancient water harvesting technique being used in the dry regions. Sand dams, which were invented by the Romans in 400BC, have become an important source of water for domestic and agricultural needs. Sand dams are constructed by building a concrete barrier or wall across a seasonal river with a firm bedrock. As the river flows, sand in the water is deposited behind the wall. Over time, layers of sand build into a reservoir for water, which remains stored in the sand once the river level drops. Evaporation is virtually impossible below a metre of sand \u2013 no matter how intense the sun \u2013 and the water is clean and safe for immediate drinking as the sand acts like a filter.     A woman collects water stored beneath the sand. Photograph: Geoffrey Kamadi    The Africa Sand Dam Foundation (ASDF) has been facilitating the construction of the dams alongside Excellent Development (ED), a UK-based NGO that has enabled the construction of 838 sand dams in rural dry lands across eight countries. The work of ED has improved access to clean water for more than 800,000 people, according to Jonny McKay, the NGO\u2019s communications manager. Not only have the sand dams improved water security for local communities. Villagers are also coming together to form self-help groups to construct the dams with assistance from the NGOs, and to initiate agro-based economic schemes. \u201cWe are able to practise agribusiness now that we have water available for irrigation,\u201d says Elizabeth Ndungune, the chairwoman of the Star Thange self-help women\u2019s group in Ulilinzi. Using water from the sand dam built on the nearby River Thange, the group can now grow kale, tomatoes, beans and other crops. They sell whatever they harvest and pool the proceeds, which help families pay for school fees. While sand dams are a cheap and simple solution to some complex problems, they can fail if they are not applied in a way that meets the users\u2019 needs. \u201cThe biggest challenge is ensuring that the technology is applied to specific local conditions and people\u2019s needs, rather than simply being replicated from one place and situation to another,\u201d says McKay.  But the initiative is gaining momentum and expanding not only to other parts of the country, but to Tanzania, Chad, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and even to India.

Photograph: Ronald Reategui    On the hardscrabble, treeless highland plain that joins Peru with Bolivia, farmers have eked out an existence for thousands of years amid bitter winters and the harsh sun, at 4,000 metres above sea level and higher. As scientists predict climate change will make the Altiplano\u2019s weather even more inclement and unpredictable, today\u2019s farmers are reviving an ancestral system of cultivation and irrigation using what looks like an intricate piece of land sculpture. Resembling an ornate garden maze from above, suqakollos \u2013 or waru-warus \u2013 are a patterned system of raised cropland and water-filled trenches.   Related: We only have five years to achieve clean water and safe toilets for all    Alipio Canahua, an agronomist working with the Food and Agriculture Organisation  (FAO), says that the ancient agricultural system, which could date back 3,000 years, actually creates its own microclimate. \u201cIt captures water when there are droughts and drains away water when there\u2019s too much rain, meaning that it irrigates the crops all year round,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen it comes to temperature, we\u2019ve measured a rise of three degrees centigrade in the immediate environment around it \u2013 this can save a significant percentage of the crops from being killed in frosts.\u201d A suqakollo can also be a small oasis in the scorching daytime sun, which yellows even the coarse highland grass, known as ichu \u2013 the main fodder for the alpacas and llamas herded by the local Aymara people. Canahua has been leading the resurgence of this ancient farming system with local communities, restoring old suqakollos and building new ones. Sonia Ticona, a local indigenous Aymara leader who has been working with Canahua, says that in her village, the women work harder than the men to dig the trenches which are filled with water.     Sonia Ticona, a local indigenous Aymara leader, explains that her community are reviving techniques used by their great-great-grandfathers. Photograph: Ronald Reategui    \u201cOur great-great-grandfathers used the suqakollo system then at some point, and we don\u2019t know why, they stopped. Now we are restarting it and bringing it up to date \u2013 men and women working together.\u201d Potatoes have been sown this season \u2013 next year it will be quinoa \u2013 in a carefully planned crop rotation, explains Canahua. While the yields are smaller than cultivating in larger fields, beating the plummeting winter temperatures, which can reach -20C, can prevent devastating crop losses. The suqakollos project is one of several globally important agricultural heritage systems (GIAHS) funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), which is working with the regional governments of Cusco and Puno. Along with Peru\u2019s agricultural ministry, the FAO is promoting family farming with the GIAHS methodology.  Canahua\u2019s only frustration is that it\u2019s not possible to make the suqakollos as big as Puno\u2019s pre-hispanic people did. Archaeologists say that people have lived on the Altiplano \u2013 on the shores of the highest navigable lake, Lake Titicaca \u2013 for some 8,000 years, and traces of the ancient canals still mark the high plain. Roads and boundaries between communal lands, however, have limited the space available.   Related: What \u2018rain\u2019 means to aid workers around the world \u2013 in pictures    John Preissing, the FAO\u2019s representative in Peru, says the pilot project has produced more than double the normal crop yields. \u201cWe can\u2019t isolate just the fact that we\u2018re using suqakollos but we can say that between the water management, the soil management and the fertiliser management, we are reaching double the harvest numbers.\u201d  Figures for 2013-14 indicate that suqakollo\u2019s crop yields for quinoa are 3.2 tonnes per hectare, more than double the average of 1.3 tonnes per hectare for the same crop grown on the plain. Ancestral crops like quinoa, and its kiwicha and kaniwa varieties, could make this labour-intensive, complex farming system worthwhile; international demand for the superfoods has multiplied the price, bringing in extra income for these smallholder farmers.

        "body": "This time last year, Samuel Aboto had 600 goats; today, he has none. \"I am not exaggerating \u2013 everybody knew my goats,\" he says as he shelters from the sun under a thatch of reeds. Twenty-six months of drought has hit pastoralists in northern Kenya hard, and Aboto is facing the fourth poor rainy season in a row. The last good rain in Nayanae'angikalalio, central Turkana, was between March and May 2012.Two weeks ago, there was one small shower. Aboto points to an outcrop across a few miles of tawny sand and scrub. \"There,\" he says, jabbing with his finger. A line of camels cross the horizon, the only animals the land can currently support.Aboto, who has four scrawny sheep remaining, draws a comparison to three years ago, when drought triggered a famine in Somalia and almost 4 million Kenyans were at risk of starvation (pdf). \"It was almost the same as this,\" he says. \"That was a combination of lack of grass and disease; this time it's just drought.\"The findings of a Kenyan nutrition survey, published this month by the health ministry in consultation with the UN and NGOs, have alarmed experts. In the most vulnerable arid and semi-arid regions, which span about 80% of the country, one in four children is acutely malnourished and requires medical attention.Overall malnutrition rates in Turkana, Baringo and Mandera counties, and in the west of Wajir, have deteriorated significantly, according to the World Food Programme (WFP). A malnutrition rate of more than 15% is classified as a critical emergency by the World Health Organisation; in many parts of Kenya it exceeds 20%. \"The survey found truly alarming levels of malnutrition,\" says Challiss McDonough, a WFP spokeswoman.In Turkana Central, the rate of moderate and severe acute malnutrition is 60% higher than a year ago, according to Kenya's health ministry. Last year, 17% of those surveyed \u2013 pregnant women, nursing mothers and under-fives\u2013 were acutely malnourished. That proportion has risen to 29%.Women listen to elders discussing drought in Nayanae'angikalalio, Turkana Central. Residents say the village has not had adequate rainfall since May 2012. Photograph: Jessica HatcherAside from drought, numerous factors are affecting access to food in Kenya's arid north, where the majority of people are pastoralists. Rapidly increasing populations have piled pressure on resources, and people have become less mobile. During a dry spell, herders once moved freely across the borders of Ethiopia, South Sudan and Uganda in search of fresh pasture. These days, national and regional boundaries, and the proliferation of small arms along them, have made it risky to do so.Cattle raiding is out of control on some borders. \"Conflict in the south and east [of Turkana County] is not traditional cattle rustling. It has become commercialised. There are businesses; men and women waiting to load [the cattle] and take them to market,\" says the deputy county governor, Peter Lokoel. It must be understood, he says, that conflict is contributing to malnutrition rates across the county, especially either side of Turkana's southern border. \"Today you are rich; tomorrow you have nothing,\" he says, referring to the clashes between raiders in Turkana and Pokot.As herds dwindle, men in Turkana are increasingly relying on their wives, many of whom sell charcoal or handmade jewellery and baskets. They buy maize flour and oil with the few hundred shillings (only a few dollars) they earn. \"The quantities are very small: that's what's hurting the most. Food cost 50 cents or a shilling during the first president's era. These days, you pay hundreds and get nothing,\" says Rodha Lokirion, an elderly woman who lives in a village 10 miles north of Lodwar, the capital of Turkana County.In Lodwar, 2kg of maize costs about 180 shillings ($2.14); in outlying areas, it can cost more. Residents say the decrepit road that connects Lodwar to the rest of Kenya has contributed to high food costs.For a trader to travel 300km (186 miles) by bus to Kitale, the first town south of Turkana, it takes about six hours and costs 1,600 shillings \u2013 approximately what the average Kenyan earns in a week, according to the World Bank. \"It's very expensive. When the road is good, the journey would be two to three hours,\" says Michael Emekwi Peikan, 31, who scrapes a living by driving a rented motorbike taxi.On Lake Turkana, one of the region's few reliable sources of protein, fish catches are dwindling. \"A lot of people are now engaging in fishing. They lack proper gear, so are putting a lot of pressure on the shallow waters that they are able to access,\" says Billy Kapua, projects manager at Friends of Lake Turkana, a community-led environmental trust. The shallower waters are critical for breeding fish. \"If the government could scale up support for fishermen to make the deeper waters accessible, that would help.\"An aquifer below Turkana, which raised hopes of drought relief when it was announced last year, will yield nothing in the short term, Kapua says. There are resources and enough capacity to bolster the relief effort until the end of September, according to WFP, but the country could be hit by a severe funding shortfall thereafter.Jessica Hatcher reported from Turkana with the assistance of a grant from the Pulitzer Centre for Crisis Reporting",

        "body": "The financial implications of a yes vote for Scottish independence came under intense scrutiny as home owners were warned it would be harder get a mortgage and Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group made plans to move to London if the electorate backed a breakaway from the UK.The revelations about the contingency plans by the two banks \u2013 which employ thousands of people in Scotland \u2013 to set up legal entities in England came after Scottish homebuyers were facing warnings it could be harder to obtain a mortgage in the event of a yes vote.The bosses of two major companies \u2013 BP and Standard Life \u2013 had also voiced their concerns about the impact of a yes vote even before details emerged of the plans being made by the two bailed-out banks to move their crucial legal status if the referendum on 18 September backed Alex Salmond's independence campaign.In a statement issued last night, Lloyds \u2013 which owns Bank of Scotland and is 25% owned by taxpayers \u2013 spelled out its contingency arrangements, which would be likely to involve moving its registered office from Scotland, where its Halifax Bank of Scotland business is registered. \"While the scale of potential change is currently unclear, we have contingency plans in place which include the establishment of new legal entities in England,\" it said.\"This is a legal procedure and there would be no immediate changes or issues which could affect our business or our customers,\" added Lloyds, which is the largest private sector employer in Scotland with 17,000 staff.The Treasury said the decision was understandable and Treasury sources said RBS was making similar preparations. \"The government is not making contingency plans for a yes vote,\" a Treasury spokesman said. RBS is thought to be making a statement on Thursday.David Nish, the Standard Life chief executive, said: \"Standard Life has a long history in Scotland \u2013 a heritage of which we are very proud and we hope that this continues \u2013 but our responsibility is to protect the interests of our customers, our shareholders, our people and other stakeholders in our business.\"Bob Dudley, the BP boss who has faced criticism for not speaking out enough on the critical issue of oil, said the future prospects for the North Sea would be best served if the UK stayed together because \"future long-term investments require fiscal stability and certainty\".The intentions of the two banks \u2013 bailed out with \u00a365bn of taxpayer funds \u2013 came after Bank of England governor Mark Carney had endured intense scrutiny about the financial implications for an independent Scotland by MPs on the Treasury select committee.He had stressed Threadneedle Street had contingency plans in the face of concerns about capital flight from Scotland and indicated that a Scottish central bank could need at least 25%, and possibly more than 100%, of the nation's GDP in reserves if Salmond decides to use sterling after independence without the support of Westminster.Banks are also thought to be devising other contingency plans. One source said they may transport more bank notes to Scotland to \"ensure appropriate liquidity\" if customers want to withdraw more cash in the event of a yes vote.One housing industry insider said there has already been an impact on the housing market, with signs that the market for homes worth more than \u00a3600,000 \u2013 the top end of the market in Scotland \u2013 is drying up. At the same time, commercial property deals were being put on hold until the vote was known \u2013 and could be abandoned in the event of a yes vote.Some potential property buyers have inserted clauses into their offers saying \"subject to a no vote\", according to the mortgage broker Ray Boulger of John Charcol. He said: \"A yes vote will create massive problems in terms of how mortgages are denominated and regulated. We expect it to be much more difficult for Scottish borrowers to get mortgages post a yes vote.\"Other bankers are speaking of a pause in lending until the situation is clear.Lenders are refusing to comment publicly for fear of being accused of playing politics. But one said: \"Before that poll [the Sunday Times/YouGov poll that showed the yes campaign in the lead] it was interesting but not critical. Now we are watching things very, very closely. It \u2013 introduces huge uncertainty and one way of decreasing our exposure and risk would be to reduce the loan-to-value offered to borrowers.\"However, another lender with significant operations in Scotland said it expected business to resume as usual, even in the event of a yes vote.David Hollingworth, at mortgage broker London &amp; Country, said one of the key issues involved how Scottish mortgages lent by English banks and building societies would be regulated in the event of a yes vote. He said: \"If it starts getting more and more complicated in terms of currency, regulation and so on, is it going to be something lenders adapt to, or are they actually going to turn their back on that market? Certainly, some smaller lenders could decide on the latter. The larger ones may well stick with it.\"The precise amount of reserves need to back an independent Scotland will depended on the size of the banking sector, at least 10 times the size of Scottish GDP.There had been mounting expectations that banks would shift their registered offices to seek the protection of the Bank of England \u2013 to protect customers and the bank's all-important credit ratings.The governor promised to provide a detailed analysis to the committee this morning of his comments on the approach taken by other countries and Andrew Tyrie, the Tory MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, seized on Carney's remarks about the reserves Scotland would need to support the use of sterling without Westminster's permission.\"Today the governor clarified that, whatever currency arrangement is chosen, Scotland would require much higher reserves than it could inherit as a share of UK assets.\"That would leave a very big shortfall. As the governor said, meeting this shortfall would mean 'real fiscal costs' for Scotland \u2013 almost certainly higher taxes or spending cuts.\"Carney told the Treasury select committee that the Bank of England had contingency plans in place if Scotland votes on 18 September to go it alone. Several economists have warned that savers and companies could rush to move their money out of Scotland. The governor told MPs: \"There are reasons why we have -contingency plans in place\".Giving few details, Carney said that in the immediate aftermath of a yes vote, financial institutions would continue to be offered Bank of England support and depositors would be protected by the existing Financial Services Compensation Scheme. In line with EU rules, that scheme covers \u00a385,000 of savings in a single institution.",

        "body": "When Santiago hosts the final of the Copa Am\u00e9rica on 4 July this year, it will be 22 years to the day since Gabriel Batistuta received a quick throw-in from Diego Simeone, turned away from Mexico\u2019s Ra\u00fal Guti\u00e9rrez and curled a brisk left-foot finish into the bottom corner of Jorge Campos\u2019s net. It was a goal that meant Argentina defended their continental crown; it was also the last time that any Argentinian scored a winner in a major international final. Nobody could have foreseen then that seven Copas Am\u00e9rica and six World Cups later, Argentina would still be waiting for another title. They have won five Under-20 World Cups and two Olympics in that time, their clubs have lifted the Libertadores eight times since but the drought at full international level goes on. The urge to scratch that itch has motivated almost everything Gerardo Martino has done since he replaced Alejandro Sabella as the Argentina coach, and certainly explains why his squad selection, even for the upcoming friendlies against El Salvador and Ecuador, seems so conservative. The rhythm of international football in South America is different to that in Europe. In Europe there are qualifiers for the World Cup, then the tournament itself, then qualifiers for the Euros, then the tournament itself, then the cycle begins again. In South America there are World Cup qualifiers \u2013 a gruelling 18-game marathon \u2013 then the tournament itself and then for a year there\u2019s nothing, just friendlies before the same 10 teams who will meet in the World Cup qualifiers are joined by two guests \u2013 Mexico and Jamaica this year \u2013 for the Copa Am\u00e9rica. It comes only a year after the World Cup and tight on the end of the European season \u2013 five days after the Champions League final in this case \u2013 and the result is that teams often arrive at the Copa Am\u00e9rica under prepared. There is a frisson to the opening games as the favourites, starved of competitive football for a year, seek the balance and edge a qualifying series might have given them. Four years ago Argentina sleepwalked into the Copa Am\u00e9rica it was hosting, distracted by the ramifications of River Plate\u2019s unexpected relegation and by the insistence of Sergio Batista, then the coach, that his side could play like Barcelona. They couldn\u2019t, drew with Bolivia and Colombia, beat Costa Rica, and then went out on penalties to Uruguay in the quarter-final, despite having a man advantage for 48 minutes. Martino is determined that won\u2019t happen again, which is why he has overlooked the claims of the likes of Palermo\u2019s Paulo Dybala, Internazionale\u2019s Mauro Icardi and Villarreal\u2019s Luciano Vietto, all forwards who have been in fine form this season, preferring to stick with those who got Argentina to the World Cup finals. The time for experimentation, Martino has said, comes after the Copa Am\u00e9rica \u2013 although the schedule is complicated by the special centenary Copa Am\u00e9rica to be contested in the US in 2016, with all 10 Conmebol sides and six teams from Concacaf. Not that Argentina are short of forwards, with Carlos Tevez returning from exile to join Lionel Messi, who is fit, despite rumours he would be ruled out with a foot injury, Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Ezequiel Lavezzi in the squad. Tevez, Higua\u00edn and Ag\u00fcero, Martino has said, will all be given game time over the two friendlies, his implication being that he will stick with the 4-3-3 shape he has preferred so far, with a central forward flanked by Messi and \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda. There is the option of playing Di Mar\u00eda deeper, as one of the three midfielders, as Sabella did at the World Cup, or of bringing in Javier Pastore and playing a 4-2-3-1 as Argentina did in their defeat by Portugal last November but Martino has tended towards caution. The glut of high-class attacking players in the Argentina squad means, paradoxically, that fewer of them can be picked. Deficiencies in defensive areas mean Martino prefers the blunt solidity of seven largely defensive players to provide a platform for his rotating cast of three stars. Javier Mascherano\u2019s place at the back of midfield is certain but elsewhere there are places in the Copa Am\u00e9rica starting lineup to be earned. Martino has spoken of his admiration for Valencia\u2019s Enzo P\u00e9rez but he is out injured, leaving Lucas Biglia and Ever Banega as the two most likely players to flank Mascherano. The situation is no clearer at the back. Mart\u00edn Demichelis, Santiago Vergini and Federico Fazio have been left out of the squad, opening the door for Mateo Musacchio of Villarreal to come in alongside Ezequiel Garay in the centre of defence and perhaps add some much-needed pace to the back four. Martino needs solutions soon. The clock is ticking; after these two matches Argentina have only one friendly scheduled \u2013 against Bolivia on 6 June, when they may be missing players to the Champions League final \u2013 before they begin their Copa Am\u00e9rica campaign on 13 June against Paraguay in La Serena.",

        "body": "Television is all that separates MLS from becoming the truly major league its name bills it as, or so the commonly repeated rhetoric goes. For all that Stateside soccer has drawn a steep growth curve over the past decade \u2013 building state-of-the art venues, expanding to 20 franchises, having the third-highest average attendance of a sports league in the US and generally finding credibility \u2013 television is the one barrier the league has left to clear. Perhaps the new eight-year agreement with ESPN, Fox and Univision \u2013 signed last May and reported to be worth a combined $90m \u2013 will change that. MLS wants more than just a bolstered revenue stream from its new domestic broadcast deal. Ratings and engagement, rather than attendance figures, are now the yardstick by which the league\u2019s progress is gauged. The same could now be said for such development outside North America too. On the face of it, MLS\u2019s new four-year deal with Sky Sports \u2013 which sees the Rupert Murdoch-owned British broadcaster show at least two regular-season games a week, as well as the All-Star game, every play-off fixture and the MLS Cup final \u2013 is little more than just another television deal with just another broadcaster.  But with this new partnership, soccer in North America has gained a degree of legitimacy in the UK, something it has often struggled for. BT Sport \u2013 the previous holder of MLS rights in the UK \u2013 has made quite the impression since its launch in August 2013, splurging \u00a3897m on three years of exclusive Champions League rights from next season, but Sky Sports can be worn as a badge of authenticity by MLS. Imagine a television drama switching from Lifetime to HBO. In sporting terms, that\u2019s what MLS has done in Britain. Apart from anything else MLS will now be showcased to a bigger audience in the UK, with Sky Sports boasting over 10 million subscribers compared to BT Sport\u2019s 2.5 million. This year\u2019s season-opener between Orlando City and New York City FC drew 36,000 viewers and many more through the broadcaster\u2019s on-demand service. The production value isn\u2019t quite of Super Bowl standard \u2013 with nothing more than an announcer and a colour commentator speaking over a centralised feed \u2013 but nonetheless, MLS has heightened its visibility in soccer\u2019s hottest hotbed. \u201cThis is another important moment that shows the continued growth of MLS,\u201d said David Beckham - Sky Sports ambassador and MLS cheerleader - in a statement released upon news of the deal\u2019s completion. \u201cI have seen first-hand how popular soccer has become in America. Having fantastic partners such as Sky Sports on board will not only add to the coverage of the game, it will also broaden its appeal outside of the US.\u201d Disregard Beckham\u2019s glossy, PR-talk and the former LA Galaxy man prompts a pertinent point of discussion. For so long MLS has focused its efforts on growing and developing within its own borders, and understandably so. Globalisation doesn\u2019t work without a key demographic to begin with. But has the time come for MLS to consciously evolve its appeal and image abroad? If so, has such an effort started with its new British broadcast deal? MLS doesn\u2019t just have increased TV prominence in the UK this season, it also seems to have found its own time slot in Britain\u2019s crowded television sports schedule. On BT Sport, MLS struggled for a regular and consistent time slot. There was no routine behind what Stateside soccer was broadcast on the channel, with only the LA Galaxy and the New York Red Bulls receiving any live coverage during the regular season. On weeks when no live games were shown, MLS fans would have to make do with highlights \u2013 sometimes broadcast in the early hours. Sky Sports too has been somewhat guilty of focusing on the league\u2019s marquee teams \u2013 having broadcast all three of New York City FC\u2019s opening games this season, capitalising on any interest sprung from the franchise\u2019s close links with Manchester City \u2013 but the same could be said of essentially every division the world over. The exact scheduling might not give a full picture of MLS, but that there is a picture given at all \u2013 at a set time, every week \u2013 represents progress. After \u2018Super Sunday\u2019 and the Premier League\u2019s weekly dose of afternoon hyperbole, as well as whatever offerings La Liga, Serie A and Ligue 1 has for cultured europhiles, but before the BBC\u2019s Match of the Day 2, is where MLS has positioned itself - at 10pm GMT on Sundays. And it\u2019s not a bad position to be in. British sports fans will watch live soccer, regardless of where it is played, especially when nothing else is on. So what\u2019s in this new agreement for Sky Sports? Why has MLS been added to a stable which already holds rights for English Premier League, La Liga, Scottish Premiership and Dutch Eredivisie games? The belief that Brits are unwilling to embrace the \u2018Americanisation\u2019 of sport is something of a misconception. Tickets for NFL games at Wembley Stadium sell out within minutes, with the same going for NBA games played at London\u2019s O2 Arena. Even at local level, attendances are burgeoning across the country\u2019s ice hockey and basketball leagues as fans look for the family-friendly, confetti-sprinkled sporting spectacle soccer generally can\u2019t offer. Sky Sports has translated such an appeal into success with its NFL coverage \u2013 which attracted close to 14 million British viewers over the course of last season \u2013 and is now counting on the same allure to make a success of MLS in the UK. At odds with pretty much the rest of the soccer world, scheduling barbs have been angled at MLS ever since the day of its inception as a predominantly summertime pursuit. It is often claimed that implementing a more orthodox calendar \u2013 in keeping with Europe and Fida\u2019s mandatory international dates \u2013 would aid the league\u2019s global appeal, and yet the very opposite seems to be true in the case of Sky Sports\u2019 interest in MLS. Wimbledon and cricket can only fill so much airtime over the British summer \u2013 when Europe\u2019s soccer leagues take their off-season break. A cynic would claim MLS has been bought as summertime fodder by Sky Sports, but whether or not that is true should be of little concern to the league. Either way, the league has found more than just a wider audience and a niche market in the UK, but a stamp of approval too.",

        "body": "It\u2019s hard to overestimate the appalling environmental and economic crisis that\u2019s brewing in Brazil right now. The country is in the grip of a crippling megadrought \u2013 the result of pollution, deforestation and climate change \u2013 that deeply threatens its economy, society and environment. And the damage may be permanent: S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s largest city and industrial center, has begun rationing water and is discussing whether or not it will need to depopulate in the near future.  But if Brazil\u2019s drought is shocking, Wall Street\u2019s shortsighted approach to the country is appalling. Institutional investors\u2019 reports on the country \u2013 the seventh largest economy in the world \u2013 cite worries about inflation, government cutbacks and low consumer confidence. But I could not find a single analysis that mentioned the existential threat facing the country: the megadrought that is expected to last decades and could destroy the Brazilian economy. Not a single analysis cited the brutal global impact that this will cause. In other words, a host of institutional investors have found worrisome things to say about Brazil, but none seem to be aware of \u2013 or, at least, willing to face \u2013 the country\u2019s greatest threat.  Attempting to separate economies from environment \u2013 as many of these analysts seem to do \u2013 is like trying to separate mind and body. It simply doesn\u2019t work.  We will never repair our business models and government policies to conform to the real environmental constraints of the 21st century until we repair this fundamental flaw in our economic system. Investors and analysts regularly review a host of factors \u2013 including national debt, inflation, currency devaluation and other financial considerations \u2013 when they formulate their economic predictions. Their decision to omit the environment as a fundamental economic consideration is willfully ignorant and negligent.    Keep it in the Ground embed   Economies are cyclical, with periods of boom and bust. But a lack of water can cause permanent damage. S\u00e3o Paolo, which is one of the richest cities in the world, serves as the financial center for most of South America. The consequences of this drought are hard to calculate, but one can get an idea by imagining how water rationing in New York City \u2013 and the attendant population drop, public outcry and social instability \u2013 would affect the world\u2019s economy.  This lack of foresight on the part of financial analysts is nothing new. They are overlooking this high risk situation, just as they did with the dotcom boom and bust, the subprime global meltdown, and a host of other financial crises. This willful delusion is also cyclical, and also a significant threat to the world\u2019s economy. I have worked with dozens of multinational corporations on transformative projects and initiatives that cut or eliminate waste, water usage, emissions and energy consumption. Every single company has had the same complaint: they do something spectacularly difficult and smart that enhances their company\u2019s long-term financial security. But, when it comes time for the quarterly earnings calls with Wall Street, no one ever asks about it.  Executives are responsible for maintaining a stable supply chain, a predictable P&amp;L, a respectable brand image, and a keen awareness of competition and regulations. Sustainable business innovation connects with all of these, and is one of the pillars needed to keep a modern financial house in order. Unfortunately, Wall Street doesn\u2019t seem to notice.   Related: Political will is the biggest barrier to tackling global water risk    This is as egregious as ignoring subprime debt in 2007. In India \u2013 the world\u2019s fastest-growing economy and the darling of Wall Street \u2013 one out of six deaths each year is caused by air pollution. Factor in water and pesticide issues, and the death toll creeps higher. (I guess all that economic growth will help pay for all those health care costs.)  Just as in China, India\u2019s wealthy people are moving their kids away from the big cities and centers of pollution. But clean air and water ought to be human rights, not luxuries reserved for the rich. There are so many parables about the cost of money, from Midas who died of starvation and killed his beloved daughter when he valued nothing more than gold, to the New Testament, where Jesus teaches about the price of a rich man\u2019s soul. But we don\u2019t have to get religious to agree that without clean air, land and water, and a stable climate, we all suffer. And of course, as with everything else, the least privileged among us suffer most.  Wall Street investors: please put your money where your mouth is. The finance hub is funded by EY.

        "body": "Amid what is normally considered the rainy season, Brazil, the home of the Amazon River, is suffering from a historic, punishing drought.  In a country accustomed to ample water supplies, neighbors are turning against neighbors and hoarding water as taps run dry while businesses close and protesters take to the streets. Some have even speculated that S\u00e3o Paulo, one of the world\u2019s largest cities, is failing.  The costs of a drought are many \u2013 water rationing, fines for consumption and constraints on agriculture and industrial production. But for Brazil, a water shortage also leads to another problem: more than 75% of Brazil\u2019s power comes from hydroelectric sources, making it second only to China in reliance on hydroelectric power.  The water crisis is pushing Brazil to take extreme measures to save water even as low water levels are decimating its hydropower supplies, leading to rolling power cuts across the country. With its rainforest, favelas and megacities, Brazil is a huge piece of the puzzle for many of the world\u2019s biggest sustainability goals, and the country has loomed large in environmental discussions since it held the Rio+20 climate talks in 2012.  Water courses through many of Brazil\u2019s biggest sustainability challenges. Not only does water rationing exacerbate the divide between rich and poor in the highly stratified country, but water pollution and water quality issues are threatening the country\u2019s next turn on the world stage: the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, which arrive just two years after the 2014 FIFA World Cup.  Pollution in Guanabara Bay, where Olympic sailing and windsurfing contests are scheduled to be held, is so bad that competitors have described it as an \u201copen sewer\u201d. More than 40 tons of dead fish have been removed from a lake slated to host the rowing contests.  Preparations for the Olympics are suffering from widespread dissatisfaction after last year\u2019s FIFA World Cup. The massive investments to build stadiums and host as many as a million football tourists for the soccer blowout sparked large protests from city residents left out of the economic boom, who complain they are paying higher costs of living without seeing increased services.  Brazil is in many ways an island nation unto itself \u2013 it\u2019s practically its own Portuguese-speaking continent amid the sea of Spanish Latin America. But it also faces challenges that are familiar across the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) countries: social inequality, human rights, energy, water, and climate change are all taking a toll on the country\u2019s present and future.      A resident and his dog walk across the drying bottom of the Paraibuna dam, part of the Cantareira water system that provides greater S\u00e3o Paulo with most of its water. Photograph: Roosevelt Cassio/Reuters    Add to these the importance of caring for the Amazon rainforest \u2013 the \u201clungs of the planet\u201d, which stores more carbon dioxide than anywhere else on Earth \u2013 and it becomes clear why social and environmental progress in Brazil is at least as important as its economic growth. Deforestation in the Amazon Basin has long been a thorn in Brazil\u2019s side. Not only do numerous human rights and indigenous peoples\u2019 rights threats arise from deforestation, but researchers recently directly connected Amazonian deforestation to the horrific drought in southern Brazil. Fortunately, there is some good news. Over the past decade, Brazil has lowered its carbon dioxide output more than any other country through a historic effort to slow forest loss: it reduced deforestation 18% last year. Now, other countries are trying to follow Brazil\u2019s lead in the war on tropical deforestation.    Related: Why Brazil's megadrought is a Wall Street failure    During Cop 20, the UN climate change conference in Lima last year, Brazilian authorities announced a plan to develop a monitoring system in partnership with the Amazon Cooperation Treat Organization. Around $8m will be spent in satellite data analysis, training, and equipment to be used for monitoring deforestation in all seven countries that are part of the group. Brazil\u2019s megacities also have become home to many of the innovations and disruptions taking root in the US and Europe. Startups working under the banner of the sharing economy such as Uber and Airbnb have found a home in Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo. The B Corporation social and environmental business certification launched in Brazil in 2012 as Sistema B, and just two years later became the home of the world\u2019s first publicly traded B Corp as cosmetics maker Natura earned Sistema B certification. While environmental stewardship is a less-than-common commitment among large Brazilian companies or multinationals doing business in Brazil, the country is host to a thriving social entrepreneurship sector. A number of social entrepreneurship funds operate across Brazil, bankrolling small operations to fight poverty, inequality, and expand educational and economic opportunities among the poor and disadvantaged.

Photograph: Silvia Izquierdo/AP    Brazil casts a big shadow across South America, despite its continental size and generally inward focus. As Brazil\u2019s development bank invests in more projects across its borders, it brings the promise of more economic opportunity to its less-wealthy neighbors \u2013 but also the risk of stepping on toes and stirring anti-Brazilian anger. Road-building projects in Guyana and Bolivia, a mining project in Argentina, and Brazilian emigration into Paraguay for agricultural projects have all recently incited opposition from neighboring governments and citizens. Just as Brazil weighs heavily across Latin America, it too lives in the shadow of China. Economically, the mid-2000s were Brazil\u2019s golden years. The nation averaged a healthy 4% growth, propelled by high exports \u2013 particularly to China \u2013 as well as a spike in domestic consumption. During these boom times, Brazilians saw a bright future just over the horizon. Then came the 2008 global market crash.    Related: S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 anatomy of a failing megacity: residents struggle as water taps run dry    As their export partners slowed their demand, Brazil\u2019s economy followed suit: in 2009, the economy shrank for the first time since 1992, sending shockwaves throughout the country. The rise and fall and rise again of Brazil\u2019s economy is taking place during what may turn out to be the pivotal moment in the global environmental movement. As Brazil responds to extreme drought, high-stakes deforestation, and pollution and human rights challenges, and as the country steps up to the world stage for the Olympics, its decisions will ripple not only to neighboring countries and the BRICs, but throughout the world. One example of this economic muscle-flexing is the recently proposed development of a new BRICs-led global development bank. Offered as an alternative to the World Bank and IMF, the New Development Bank proposed by China, Russia, India, Brazil and South Africa would emphasize sustainable development around the world without the punishing restrictions required by World Bank loans. While the aim of the NDB is to free BRICs and other developing economies from the status quo, observers caution that if the bank truly wants to change the course of sustainable development it must put human rights and the environment at the center of its charter.  Government, business, environmental and civil leaders will be watching closely to find out whether the country will end up being a model for sustainable development or a cautionary tale.

Tony Abbott said the assistance was \u201can acknowledgment of the difficulties being experienced by farmers and by the communities they help to sustain\u201d. \u201cIt is critical these communities remain viable and that people stay in jobs so that they can take advantage of better conditions when the drought breaks,\u201d the prime minister said. Abbott foreshadowed the funding in a joint statement with the deputy prime minister, Warren Truss, and the agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce. They said helping farmers through times of drought was in the national interest. \u201cDespite unprecedented drought conditions in some parts of the country and a third failed wet season in large parts of the north, Australia\u2019s agriculture sector will contribute an estimated $52bn to the economy this financial year,\u201d they said. The package includes $250m in the 2015-16 financial year to extend access to existing drought-specific concessional loans schemes which were due to expire. The government said it had approved $270m in concessional loans to 531 farm businesses over the past two years \u2013 although it has previously faced some criticism over tight eligibility criteria. It is understood the $270m in loans approved over the past two years comes from a total pool of $700m earmarked for three streams of loans, which include not only the drought concessional loans but also drought recovery and farm finance loans. Labor\u2019s agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, issued a statement on Friday anticipating the latest drought package announcement. \u201cIt is now clear the announcements of drought assistance which followed the prime minister\u2019s well-publicised drought tour in February 2014 have been a failure, and this weekend, he is about to concede as much,\u201d Fitzgibbon said. \u201cThe promised $280m concessional loans sounded big, but little of it has been spent because too many farmers just don\u2019t qualify or have simply concluded they are a waste of time, particularly as interest rates continue to fall.\u201d",

The state government has added another four council areas to the list of drought-declared areas following a patchy wet season and the weather bureau\u2019s declaration of an El Ni\u00f1o event that will result in hotter and drier conditions.

Yet their deaths won\u2019t change the way the country is run because the two vectors of power in North Korea \u2013 Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime and the government of neighbouring China \u2013 have no real public opinion to answer to.   In fact, Beijing has the power to dramatically alter the course of history in the DPRK. Because of this, the west needs to put pressure on both capitals and create a new vector of power: information.    North Koreans need to know they have a very great deal to envy \u2013 and to fight for    New platforms and forms of communication are necessary to reverse a campaign of brainwashing that dates back three generations. To counter the propaganda slogan used as the title of Barbara Demick\u2019s book Nothing To Envy, North Koreans need to know that they have a very great deal to envy \u2013 and to fight for.  Interviews with defectors reveal that many listen to news from shortwave radios, despite fear of severe punishment, and there is a new $50 portable media device providing a window to the outside world \u2013 despite the government\u2019s best efforts to isolate its population. Critics of the state even rely on hot-air balloons to carry anti-regime information across the border, but it\u2019s not enough.     \u2018Anti-propaganda broadcasts by balloon is not enough\u2019 Photograph: JUNG YEON-JE/AFP/Getty Images    During the second world war, the BBC broadcast  to Nazi-occupied Europe and, when that war was won, to Soviet-occupied Eastern Europe. Today, the BBC, hard-pressed as it is, must seriously consider broadcasting into North Korea, just as it is doing in Burma. According to BBC internal estimates a Korean service \u2013 absent of the regime\u2019s narcoleptic guff \u2013 would cost around \u00a31m a year to run and a shortwave transmitter would cost about \u00a3300,000 a year.  The outside world are regularly bombarded with information about North Korea \u2013 culture, sport and news the nefarious workings of the state \u2013 but its citizens need to understand more about the true working of their own country too.  So, if the BBC are able to get it up and running, here\u2019s where I suggest they start: Malnutrition and kidnappings: broadcast that North Korean statistics may not be reliable but tape measures, that show defectors to be between three and eight centimetres shorter than their South Korean couterparts, are.  The World Food Programme attributes this disturbing reality it on mass malnutrition, from one generation to another. Broadcast that.  Most of the scant information about North Korea comes from defectors and a tiny number of westerners who have been chewed up by the regime. The latest to write a book is Hyeonseo Lee. Broadcast that.   Membership Event: Guardian Live: Hyeonseo Lee on escaping North Korea     Broadcast, too, the state\u2019s history of kidnapping foreign nationals. In 1978 a Romanian artist, Doina Bumbea, was taken from Italy and forced to travel to North Korea. The best guess for the insane rash of kidnaps was to enhance the regime\u2019s intelligence efforts. .  Once there, Doina was invited to marry James Dresnok, an American GI who had defected to the DPRK in the 1960s and the couple had two sons, Ted and James Jr. Blond-haired, blue-eyed young American-Romanians who speak English with a North Korean accent. Broadcast that.   Italian chef Ermanno Furlanis was flown to North Korea in 1997 at the height of the famine, which one estimate says killed between 600,000 and 2.5 million people, to cook for Kim Jong-il. He was given the finest ingredients flown in from the world\u2019s most expensive shops, banquets of delight washed down with Barolo wine and Remy Martin. Broadcast that. Necrocracy and political weakness: broadcast that  The long-deceased Kim Il-sung is still thought of as the president of North Korea: the world\u2019s only necrocrat lies in state in his mausoleum still venerated by his people.  Afraid of blowing my cover, I bowed three times in his honour on our trip to North Korea in 2013 \u2013 an act of homage I still wrestle with. The mausoleum has constant heat and power, while homes and hospitals battle with constant blackouts. Broadcast that.    This regime, that looks so strong, is weaker than it looks. Broadcast that.     The founder\u2019s grandson Kim Jong-un is a punier figure, politically speaking. Killing rivals is a Kim family trait. North Korea expert Adam Cathcart says that doing so openly highlights vulnerability in his leadership, not strength.  Pirate videos, thumb-drives and smuggled phones spread the truth, that in the outside world, people lives unimaginably better lives than they do inside North Korea. This regime, that looks so strong, is weaker than you think. Broadcast that.

        "body": "In the latter part of July there was not a cloud in sight over La Guajira, Colombia. The rainy season should have begun in late April or early May, but during the past months only a few drops of precious rain have fallen on the parched landscape surrounding the departmental capital of Riohacha. As you drive along dusty roads to outlying \u2018rancher\u00edas\u2019 \u2013 isolated rural villages inhabited by the predominant Way\u00fau indigenous population \u2013 there is a visible line about 5 feet up the trunks of the scrub trees and bushes that line the road, where wandering herds of goats have eaten every piece of green within their reach. \u201cIt\u2019s El Ni\u00f1o\u201d the villagers say, referring to the periodic effect of the rain-stealing weather pattern. \u201cThe bad little boy has come again to make our lives even harder.\u201d This is the second year in a row that a lack of rain has assailed the people of La Guajira. In this northern peninsula of Colombia where the presence of water can mean life or death, the continued scarcity of rainfall is taking its toll. During last year\u2019s prolonged drought, infant malnutrition and mortality from water-related illness rose alarmingly. Approximately 20,000 livestock \u2013 crucial to the livelihoods of the Way\u00fau \u2013 perished from lack of water and forage. According to the latest predictions of the Colombian Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies (known as IDEAM for its acronym in Spanish), the current climatic conditions will most likely extend through August \u2013 possibly right on through the next rainy season that normally occurs in September and October.     Aguyauda is helping to reduce the impact of the water crisis. Photograph: Femsa    The impact of this year\u2019s El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon can be easily seen: traditional jag\u00fceys \u2013 rain catchment ponds that provide water to both the Way\u00fau villagers and their animals \u2013 have dried. Community wells produce less and less water and the water they do provide is becoming increasingly salty \u2013 to the point of being unfit for human consumption. Stopgap government and privately \u2013 funded programs designed to provide temporary relief by sending tanker trucks of water out to the rural villages are becoming the rule rather than the exception, and are often the only source of water to which a community has access. It is in this environment that the non-profit organisation Aguayuda (Water Help) carries out its work to help alleviate the situation and bring a ray of hope to the villages it serves. A member of an international grouping of sixteen organisations brought together by the Millennium Water Alliance (MWA), Aguayuda is also part of Lazos de Agua, a program which was launched by FEMSA Foundation MWA, and Coca-Cola Latin America with the goal of giving access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene to over 100,000 people, including the Way\u00fau, in five Latin American countries. Paola Lopez, a bi-lingual social worker helping to coordinate Aguayuda\u2019s efforts in the Way\u00fau villages \u2013 work that includes the repair of windmills, the installation of water storage tanks and important training and organisation in water, sanitation and hygiene \u2013 says this about her experience: \u201cWhen we go into the villages, we see how great the need for water is and how much it affects every aspect of their life.  \u201cSometimes the most important thing is to just provide immediate relief with a water truck delivery. Then we can look at other solutions, such as training in how to better manage the water resources they have and community organisation so they can begin to take control of and address their own water needs.\u201d     \u201cWhen we go into the villages, we see how great the need for water is and how much it affects every aspect of their life.\u201d Photograph: Femsa    Addressing the water crisis in La Guajira is not easy or glamorous. It requires long days and hard travel on dusty roads to isolated Way\u00fau communities. Often the solution isn\u2019t readily seen or available and involves a long process of working alongside the villagers to identify the best way forward. What is most important is to foment a sense of hope and determination as they make their way through the immediate crisis and turn their attention to ensuring that their water and sanitation needs are met well into the future.  \u201cWe try to take a long-term approach to addressing the effects of the drought.\u201d states Sim\u00f3n Zimmer, Aguayuda co-founder and program director. \u201cClimate change is an ongoing fact of life here, and while we can do little to stop it, we can help prepare the people of La Guajira to better confront it. In addition to providing the Way\u00fau community with basic tools and knowledge to ensure their health and wellbeing during this period of crisis, we work with other organisations in the area in order to develop strategies for supporting the Way\u00fau community in their quest for long-lasting solutions that ensure safe and secure access to water that meets all of their daily needs. It may be a dream, but it\u2019s a dream worth having.\u201d Bill Weaver is executive director of Aguayuda, Colombia.

More pertinent right now is whether or not the craze has reached, er, tipping point. As it lived by social media, so the ice bucket challenge could die by it. If there\u2019s one counter-trend to pour room-temperature water on the craze, it\u2019s #droughtshaming. The state of California is currently experiencing one of the worst droughts on record. Taps have dried up, lakes and reservoirs are emptying, water wastage is being fined. So gestures such as companies dousing their staff en masse in hundreds of gallons of icy water, come across more as wasteful PR exercises than charitable gestures \u2013 and are being called out as such on Twitter.     Ice bucket challange: one Instagram user had a sardonic way of expressing their reservations    There has been a similar reaction in China. Last week, protesters in drought-stricken Henan province raised empty red buckets over their heads, accompanied by the slogan \u201cHenan, please say no to the ice bucket challenge\u201d. More practical is India\u2019s Rice Bucket Challenge, started by a Hyderabad journalist, whereby participants simply give a bucket of rice to someone who needs it. China\u2019s ministry for civil affairs, while broadly supportive, has warned citizens against the practice\u2019s \u201centertainment and commercial tendencies\u201d \u2013 so don\u2019t hold out for Xi Jinping in his swimming trunks. Likewise, the US state department has forbidden diplomats from participating for fear of favouring particular charities. There are also ethical objections: Pamela Anderson and Grimes are among those who refused to take the challenge due to the ALS Association\u2019s animal testing. Catholic leaders in the US have also banned schools from donating to the association since it carries out embryonic stem cell research.     The Rice Bucket Challenge: simply give some food to someone who needs it    But the real dampener could be the risk of bodily harm. Yesterday, the craze claimed its first fatality \u2013 albeit tenuously. A teenager drowned at a quarry in Fife shortly after taking the challenge. This comes after Corey Griffin \u2013 who popularised the Ice Bucket Challenge \u2013 drowned on Friday in a tragic diving accident. Last week, four firefighters in Kentucky were seriously injured in an elaborate variation on the challenge, in which a firetruck ladder got too close to overhead power lines. And doctors around the world have warned of risks to elderly people, expectant mothers and people with heart conditions. One Chinese health broadcast even warned of potential damage to vertebrae by ice cubes. Could it be that the ice bucket challenge can actually damage your health?

Like many other crops, pumpkins are suffering from California\u2019s crippling three-year drought, which has cost the state $2.2 billion in 2014 alone. Now a new study shows that it may have been caused by the same atmospheric phenomenon that triggered the devastating decade-long \u201cDust Bowl\u201d drought of the 1930s. Starting in 1934, the dust bowl drought left nearly three-quarters of the western United States utterly parched and forced tens of thousands of families to abandon their farms. Using tree ring data, sea surface temperatures and rainfall records, Benjamin Cook from NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies and colleagues have reconstructed the last one thousand years of North American droughts, and shown that the dust bowl drought really was exceptional. The findings, which are published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, reveal that the dust bowl was around seven times larger than other major North American droughts in the last millennium, and nearly 30 per cent worse than the continent\u2019s next most severe drought, which occurred in 1580. But Cook and his colleagues also found that the trigger for the dust bowl \u2013 a high pressure ridge over the west coast during winter, which deflects rain-laden storms \u2013 is also responsible for the current Californian drought, and the 1976 drought (one of the most severe in the state\u2019s history). However, the current drought is unlikely to turn into a repeat of the dust bowl, as better agricultural practices are helping to limit wind erosion and reducing the likelihood of dust storms.  ",

Thanks to a handful of December storms that have hit the dry state, Bridalveil, Cascade and Yosemite Falls are living up to their reputation as some of the most beautiful natural wonders in the country. At 2,425 feet, Yosemite Falls is one of the tallest in North America and comprises three separate waterfalls: Upper Yosemite Fall, Middle Cascades and Lower Yosemite Fall. The National Park Service has a webcam that shows latest conditions at Yosemite Falls.  The falls were mostly dry in the summer months, but two major storms moved through California in the past few weeks providing some water in the extremely dry state.          Yosemite falls in December    \u201cWhen you stand close, the decibel level seems impossible,\u201d Lucy Garces, 27, a park employee, told the LA Times.  \u201cYou can hear the power and the danger and you feel so small, but it\u2019s so big that you get to be here and cherish it.\u201d Vernal and Nevada falls have more land with snowmelt to feed them, so usually they fall longer and stronger later into the year than Yosemite Falls.             In May, snow surveys showed that the river drainage for the Merced and Tuolumne rivers that flow through waterfalls and creeks into the valley were at unusually low levels. Merced drainage was at 15% of average and Tuolumne at 25% average. In May 2011, the Merced river drainage was at 199% of the average and Tuolumne at 184% the average. While the rain and snow have helped the waterfalls, this month\u2019s rain is barely putting a dent in the debilitating drought in the state. State officials warned on 12 December that consistent rains through the winter and spring are needed to begin drought recovery. ",

        "body": "Ten years ago, an especially strong and destructive hurricane season brought Katrina to Louisiana in August, followed two months later by Wilma slamming into the Florida coast. And then, for the next 10 years, nothing: no major hurricanes have hit the United States since.  As the US approaches another hurricane season beginning on 1 June, it will also be approaching a historic milestone: there have been no category 3 or above hurricanes in nearly a decade, a stroke of luck that scientists say is truly out of the ordinary. This current \u201churricane drought\u201d is the longest ever recorded since scientists began keeping track of hurricanes in 1851. The last record of eight years happened from 1861\u201368. New research from Nasa\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, published this week in Geophysical Research Letters, suggests the historic drought is probably just a coincidence. \u201cWe concluded it\u2019s basically dumb luck,\u201d said co-author of the report and senior scientist at Nasa\u2019s Goddard Institute Dr Timothy Hall. \u201cIf [the drought] went on and on and on we\u2019d question our assumptions, but for now it seems to be luck.\u201d There have been plenty of major storms and hurricanes since 2005, but all major hurricanes have missed the US and instead concentrated on other regions around the Atlantic Ocean. And there have been more minor storms that were nonetheless destructive within the US: Hurricane Sandy in 2012 (category 1), Hurricane Irene in 2011 (category 1) and Hurricane Ike in 2008 (category 2). Most of the damage from those storms came from rain and subsequent flooding (partially exacerbated by sea-level rise and storm surge).  Hall said the lack of major wind damage from hurricanes in the last decade could have serious consequences if people are lulled into a sense of complacency about extreme weather. Hall\u2019s study, carried out with Kelly Hereid from ACE Tempest RE, a reinsurance firm, found that insurance rates were falling in hurricane-prone areas, and people were flocking to the coasts \u2013 meaning there could be more damage when a major hurricane eventually makes landfall.",
